"The Florida judge in the Broin secondhand-smoke lawsuit on Thursday said he may undo the class-action status of the case, a move that would likely delay the start of a trial, scheduled for Monday. Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye said during a hearing that even if tobacco companies were found liable by a jury for injuries caused by secondhand smoke, the claims of an estimated 60,000 plaintiffs might be too cumbersome for a single trial.   Kaye said determining the direct linkage of secondhand smoke to individual ailments and setting the amounts due each of the non-smoking flight attendants covered by the Broin suit might be nearly impossible. ""I am very concerned about these issues,"" Kaye said. The judge, who is also weighing a tobacco-industry request that fraud and conspiracy allegations be dropped from the suit, gave no indication when he might rule. Another pre-trial hearing was scheduled for Friday.   Kaye five years ago knocked down the class-action status of the Broin case, first filed in 1991, but was overturned three years ago by a Florida appeals court, which ordered a trial after hearing tobacco company arguments the case was too cumbersome. In a class-action suit, a few plaintiffs claim damages on behalf of a broader group with similar injuries. All share in damage payments, if there are any.   The Broin case, named after American Airlines flight attendant Norma Broin, alleges that cigarette smoke aboard U.S. passenger jets caused the lung cancer and other ailments of thousands of non-smoking flight attendants. In-flight smoking in the United States was banned in 1988. In court on Thursday, tobacco company lawyers asked Kaye to end the class-action status of the Broin suit and said each of the claims needed to be tried individually, since many factors beyond cigarette smoke may have caused the flight attendants' injuries.   ""This cannot proceed as a class action without dissolving into 60,000 individual trials,"" said Hugh Whiting, an attorney for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. Susan Rosenblatt, an attorney pressing the Broin case, said people with like injuries could be grouped for determining damages if the tobacco companies should be found liable in the first stage of the trial. Such sessions would be ""relatively simple,"" she said.   She also said a financial settlement might be worked out with the tobacco companies if a jury should rule against them. ""They don't like to talk about that but it's a possibility,"" she said. Tobacco companies have yet to pay a single dollar in damages, despite four decades of U.S. lawsuits, but they are now in secret talks with government officials that might end some of the court actions against the industry.   Kaye asked Rosenblatt what would happen if he should end the class-action status of Broin. She said she and her co-counsel and husband, Stanley Rosenblatt, were not now prepared for such a late change. ((--Miami newsroom, 305-374-5013)) ","MichaelConnor"
"Chief executives of Conrail Inc., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. are expected to hold a crucial meeting this week that could help put a giant railroad merger back on track. Although final details still had not been set by late Monday, sources familiar with the plans said the meeting of the three executives was likely to occur by the end of the week. ""They are working on a date to meet in the next few days,"" said one source close to the railroads who did not want to be identified. Conrail's David LeVan, CSX's John Snow and David Goode of Norfolk Southern last week agreed to hold discussions about the planned $9.5 billion merger of Conrail and CSX. First announced in October, the planned transaction has been fraught with troubles due to a rival $10.3 billion bid from Norfolk Southern. Philadelphia-based Conrail has rejected the Norfolk Southern offer, contending that the CSX deal was a better fit. Earlier this month, however, Conrail shareholders rejected a key measure needed for the CSX transaction to move forward. Sources said that attorneys for the three railroads over the weekend hammered out terms of draft confidentiality pacts. Only LeVan, Snow and Goode are expected to participate in the meeting. Two other sources familiar with the companies' plans said the three railroads may announce as soon as Tuesday that a meeting has been scheduled, but likely will not provide any Like most industry experts, the sources involved in the transaction warned that any agreement between the three railroads will not be quick. ""I don't think this is an easy thing to resolve. It's a long way from saying this is a done deal,"" said one. ""I think everyone agrees its resolveable, but certainly the parties are starting out far apart,"" said another. Some Wall Street experts have speculated that the ultimate conclusion will call for a splitting up of Conrail's assets. But one of the sources close to Conrail stressed that LeVan still opposes carving up the railroad and distributing the pieces to Richmond, Va.-based CSX and Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern executives will be in New York on Wednesday for a quarterly meeting with Wall Street analysts. ","RobinSidel"
"The United States signed an important air services agreement with Hong Kong on Monday, guaranteeing its future aviation links after the British-ruled territory's return to China later this year. But Washington voiced concern about a big rise in landing fees which has dismayed airlines planning to use Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok, due to open a year from now. The territory's airport authority chief said the door was still open for discussions with the airline industry. Signing Hong Kong's 19th air accord with foreign countries, U.S. Consul-General Richard Boucher said Washington was concerned levies for landing and parking at Chek Lap Kok would be too high, and he called for competitive rates. ""This is something that our firms are primarily concerned about, that they raised with us, and yet it is something that we in the government are concerned about, and we want to talk to the relevant authorities on the Hong Kong side,"" Boucher said. ""We have (talked) in the past and we will continue to talk to them, as our companies have, to try to work out this problem, so that Hong Kong has efficient, competitive and commercially reasonable rates and a setup here that works both in a commercial sense and in terms of a competitive sense as well."" Airlines have said recently landing costs could be three to four times higher than at the present Kai Tak airport, and even the airport authority has said overall fees may nearly double. Industry Analysts and some airlines, such as Taiwan's China Airlines, have said the rises could hurt their profit margins, push up ticket prices, or force traffic to other airports at nearby Macau or China's Zhuhai and Shenzhen. Hong Kong Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip said airport officials were still consulting the airlines. ""The Airport Authority will certainly listen to the viewpoints expressed by the airlines, and I don't think a final decision has been taken. And that's the whole purpose of having consultations with the airlines,"" Ip told reporters. Monday's agreement opened the way for new routings and services, giving the United States the right to select carriers to provide non-stop services from three additional gateways. So far, Chicago and Detroit have been picked in addition to existing gateways of New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco. The agreement provided for the preservation of open competitive entry and unrestricted service offerings from all U.S. points, and preservation of the U.S. ""round the world service"" run by United Airlines. It provided ""fifth freedom rights"" between Hong Kong and points in the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand. The United States has chosen flights between Hong Kong and Subic Bay and between Hong Kong and Manila under this provision. Under the accord, Hong Kong received new gateways in the United States for passenger and all-cargo services, choosing New York and Chicago for this provision. New fifth-freedom rights were also awarded to Hong Kong, but have not yet been taken up. Nine U.S. airlines operate about 84 passenger and cargo services per week to Hong Kong. In 1996, they carried 920,000 passengers and 147,000 tonnes of cargo on direct services between Hong Kong and the United States. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Air Hong Kong operate about 21 services per week between Hong Kong and the United States. In 1996, they carried 315,000 passengers and about 42,000 tonnes of air cargo.

"Britain's double-decker bus could be at the cutting edge of an environmental breakthrough. For the past two years a London bus operator has carried out experiments with an Arab inventor who says he has the solution to the black diesel-based pollution fumes that led Britain's air quality levels to break world safety standards last summer. Hassan Assali linked up with the London and Liverpool bus company Merseyside Transport Ltd (MTL) in a two-year experiment to test his invention -- an oil recycler which he told Reuters cuts pollution levels by 50 percent and saves on lubricating oil by recycling it six to 10 times. ""Last summer there was big talk about stopping vehicles entering towns altogether as pollution levels were going through the roof. ""With this,"" said Assali cradling his recycler at his West London headquarters, ""we can cut the amount of oil used and dumped, cut pollution levels, plus save money."" The recycler, invented by Assali who is managing director of the company behind it called Pinmore, has taken six years to develop and millions of pounds (dollars) of investment funded by an anonymous Palestinian backer. The Pinmore recycler prototype was made by a gunsmith in London's East End because: ""It was the only way we could get the precision we needed,"" said Assali. MADE IN CHINA It is now being manufactured in China's Huzhan province and has sold 6,000 units at a cost of 250 pounds ($425.2) each. Customers to date include an Algerian bus company which has ordered 3,000 recyclers and Saudi Arabia's frontier guards who bought 1,000 for their trucks -- ""They're constantly plagued by desert sand getting into the oil,"" added the inventor. In November Assali held a conference in Oxford, England attended by more than 40 delegates from the transport industry, including bus companies. At the conference MTL publicly endorsed the recycler after two years of tests on its oldest London buses. Professor Gordon Andrews of the fuel and energy department at Leeds University and a consultant to the motor industry, also agreed it worked. Phil Locke, systems manager for group engineering at MTL, told Reuters: ""We've had a lot of success and it's given us tremendous savings. It's also given us smaller fuel emmissions, which are down sharply."" He said the bus group's initial scepticism had vanished and it is now considering buying up to 2,000 recyclers for its fleet in London and Liverpool. ""We've had so many people approach us in the past with different systems and they say it works. But most don't. We took a gamble on Mr Assali and it's working,"" said Locke. ""I think it's been looked at by enough people and they see the benefits -- it has the chance of turning into a big thing."" The reception from motor manufacturers like Nissan has been cooler, says Assali, despite the pressing environmental and health arguments to cut pollution. Assali also says two major oil companies have called him to rubbish his work out of hand. ""I was afraid they would send a hit-man,"" he joked. But he says the evidence is in his favour. Pinmore carried out experiments for two years in north London with MTL. RECYCLING BUS The experiment fitted one bus with a recycler and one without, said Assali. ""We said to the client ""Run these buses in the worst conditions possible - stopping, starting continuously and braking suddenly'."" He claimed the old red Routemaster bus, the famous London symbol also renowned for belching black fumes, was fitted with the recycler in February 1995 and did not have to change its oil until July that year. The London arm of MTL then invited Assali to its headquarters in Liverpool where ""I explained the invention to the top brass."" Commenting on the financial benefits, he says that MTL as a company uses 40 tonnes of oil a year -- which can easily be cut by a sixth on average by using the recycler. ""We started with three principles in mind -- to save oil, maintain engine quality and to help the environment by cutting polluting emissions."" The Pinmore filters the oil using a secondary filter controlled by a microprocessor. The filter has a pyramid of discs, down which oil cascades. Discs are heated to 160 degrees, bringing oil to 120 degrees, hotter than the engine temperature. As oil trickles down the discs the contaminants, such as water, diesel fuel and gases evaporate. The resulting vapour is fed into a chamber where it is burned off separately. Very old vehicles like the red Routemaster buses, some of which are 25 years old, can run for 60,000 kilometres (37,280 miles) without changing the oil -- that is six times the normal distance. FIRST BUSES, THEN THE WORLD Pinmore has high hopes for its product and plans to take polluting vehicles by storm. ""We will hit the bus companies first and then the black cab market in London -- 23,000 cabs in total. ""We will then tackle the major UK cities -- Sheffield, Glasgow, Bradford. The market is massive. We could take it to Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin -- every diesel city in Europe."" MTL now plans to set up a mobile laboratory where anyone can inspect the recycler and the test results. ""We're working towards helping others fight pollution. We're not trying to keep it to ourselves,"" said Locke. ""If we put it into the bus market first, then perhaps someone from the government will say ""If it works for buses then why can't it work for taxis or the private car?'.""

"Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever NV/Plc should report a 10 percent improvement in underlying profits for the full year on Tuesday but the increase will be marred by sterling's surge on foreign exchange markets. Analysts also expected Unilever to unveil a hefty charge for reorganising some of its newly acquired businesses like personal products company Helene Curtis and industrial cleaner Diversey. On average, 24 brokers polled forecast 1996 pretax profits of 2.525 billion stg up from 2.319 billion for the year to December 31, 1995.   The company is expected to take a currency hit of about 50 million stg in the fourth quarter rising to as much as 210 million in 1997. A restructuring charge of 80 million stg on average for the fourth quarter should bring the total to about 220 million net for the year. Most of the curency movement took place in the fourth quarter and Unilever operates a currency policy of applying constant exchange rates until the fourth quarter, at the end of which it calculates and applies the average rate for the year.   Sterling has apprectiated by 11.1 percent since October 1, 1996 against the ECU and about 45 percent of Unilever's business is in hard European currency terms. The real impact of currency movements will come through in the dividend payout, which is set as a percantage of earnings in sterling and Dutch guilder. Analysts forecast the total dividend in sterling will rise 4.8 percent to 30.8p but by some 8.0 percent in guilders to 8.73 guilders. In early January, many brokers recommended switching out of Unilever Plc to its NV shares to pick-up the benefit, a factor which has dragged down the company's London share price.   Unilever Plc shares were 7-1/2p lower at 1357p on Friday, but in four out of the last five years the p/e ratio has fallen to 13.5 or 14 times in the early part of the year before climbing steeply ahead of the first half figures. Brokers' estimated profits for 1997 are dependent on key assumptions about currency rates and the breakdown of income streams by currency -- many are working on the basis of $1.70 average for the year against the pound and 2.65 mark -- but six houses have downgraded their 1997 forecasts over the last month.   ""Our reading of the clues so far is to expect a higher gross restructuring than perhaps others,"" said Michael Bourke, analyst at Panmure Gordon, who is estimating a charge of 110 million in the fourth quarter to give 250 million net for the year. ""The fourth quarter tends to be where they dump the bulk of their charges and their recent acquisitions have needed considerable reorganisation,"" he said. Analysts expect to see profits driven by continued sales growth in the emerging markets of South America and a pick up in North America. However, earnings from Europe and especially Germany are likely to remain depressed.   ""North America and Latam are likely to be big the engines for growth whereas Europe remains a difficult market, but we should see the benefits of rationalisation start to come through there,"" said Nikko analyst Dermott Carr. Brokers are keen to get a tighter grip on chairman Niall FitzGerald's strategy. Since taking over as chairman in September, FitzGerald has talked about re-shaping the group to give it a sharper focus.   ""I think the market is expecting a bit too much of one man. I don't think FitzGerald will be as radical as many think but it would be interesting to get a clearer view of what he defines as a non-core business,"" said Carr. Generally analysts think Unilever will remain a fairly broad church under FitzGerald rather than a pure, branded food company and unlike the single brand focus of a Coca-Cola or Procter &amp; Gamble. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","TimFarrand"
"U.S. and Chinese officials have made a productive start to textile trade talks that are the last chance to hammer out a deal before a Friday deadline, top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said on Tuesday. Hayes met Chinese trade officials on Tuesday for the first of a scheduled three days of talks aimed at extending a bilateral textile accord and resolving a dispute involving United States penalties on imports of Chinese textiles. ""Very productive morning,"" she said, adding that much remained to be done. ""We still have lots of issues to resolve."" The 1994 Sino-U.S. textile accord had been scheduled to expire on December 31 last year but was extended by one month to allow the two sides to hammer out their differences on renewal. Disagreement over textiles was not likely to lead to a cross-Pacific trade war but the Friday deadline would not be changed, Hayes said earlier. ""The deadline is January 31 and there are no more extensions, so we have to reach agreement,"" she told reporters before beginning negotiations at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. ""We are in hopes that the consultations will continue the mood that they had in the previous consultations and that is that both sides are trying to get an agreement,"" she said. Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions. China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks. The two sides failed to reach agreement on the issue in talks in the United States last month. Washington said then it would re-examine its decision to reduce quotas for Chinese textile imports. China's textile sales to the United States have long been a sensitive point for U.S. trade negotiators eager to reduce Washington's swelling trade deficit. Sino-U.S. ties have been strained by disputes over issues ranging from trade to Taiwan to human rights, but both sides say tensions have eased in recent months. U.S. trade official Lee Sands was due in Beijing on Tuesday for meetings with Chinese officials that were expected to focus on China's long-delayed entry to the World Trade Organisation.

"A monster shakeup of Canada's biggest city, Toronto, has sparked a citizens revolt against Ontario's ruling Conservatives and raised eyebrows among those who do business in the country's financial capital. This clean, peaceful city -- sometimes dubbed ""New York run by the Swiss"" -- recently has become a battleground in the so-called ""Common Sense Revolution"" initiated by Ontario's Conservative Premier Mike Harris. Promising leaner, cheaper government, Harris wants to merge Toronto and six neighboring municipalities into a single ""megacity"" of 2.4 million people. The new city would hold about 8 percent of Canada's 30 million people and dwarf all but three of Canada's ten provinces. Harris also plans a fundamental shift in how public services -- everything from education to welfare -- are delivered and paid for. Opponents fear the municipal reform blitz will drive up taxes and lead to the kind of urban decay witnessed in many major U.S. cities just across the border. The threat of such wrenching change being rammed through without a binding plebiscite has outraged citizens and prompted accusations of tyranny and fascism. ""Government is not elected for the politicians. It is elected by the people for the people,"" Toronto mayor Barbara Hall told a crowd after residents in the seven affected areas voted three to one against a merger in a referendum this week. The vote was not binding on Ontario's government, which has vowed to press ahead with its plan. The referendum capped a raucus campaign which saw an Ontario cabinet minister likened to Adolf Hitler, bomb threats against a polling firm, and thousands of protesters marching in the streets in a re-enactment of a civic rebellion in 1837. Harris has held firm. ""I don't think we can withdraw the need for change,"" he said this week, adding that there may be amendments when the legislation is introduced this spring. The ""megacity"" revolt has grabbed headlines across the country and overseas, even prompting some foreign consulates to keep a wary eye on the political wrangling. ""There is some interest, but it's purely because it has appeared in the (British) papers,"" said Terry Curran, the British Consul in Toronto. Meanwhile, high-profile Canadian business leaders, politicians and artists have joined to oppose the merger plan. They include film director Norman Jewison, Molson Cos. Ltd. CEO Norman Seagram, and author Margaret Atwood who compared the megacity's architects to the Three Stooges. The ""No"" side captured 75 percent of the votes in the referendum, but the process was flawed and turnout was low. Under draft legislation, known as Bill 103, the seven city halls and 106 politicians that now govern the Greater Toronto Area will shrink to one elected mayor and 44 councillors. The government also plans to overhaul property taxes, eliminate more than half of the province's school boards, seize control of education funding and download a bigger share of social program costs onto the municipalities. Harris has said the reforms are revenue neutral, but critics say municipalities may be forced to raise taxes. They fear welfare rolls could soar and one of the hardest hit communities would be Toronto, which has a heavier welfare caseload and nearly half of the province's social housing. ""You're doing something that is very volatile and on a tax base which has very little flexibility,"" said George Fierheller, president of Toronto's Board of Trade. Over 75 percent of the board's members favor reducing the size of government through a merger But nearly half worry about dumping such heavy responsibilities onto municipalities. ""As a Torontonian and a businessman responsible for a large company, I'm wary of abrupt change without making sure you've thought it through,"" said Peter Godsoe, chairman of Canada's fourth-largest bank, Bank of Nova Scotia. The influential debt rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, has warned ""the very nature and scale of the reforms...create new challenges that could affect the credit quality of some municipalities."" The downloading trend has been a feature of government at all levels in Canada as they struggle with budget deficits. Canada's ruling Liberal Party in Ottawa has dumped responsibility for public services onto the provinces in recent federal budgets. Now the cash-strapped provinces are the doing the same to municipalities. The autonomy of municipalities is severely restricted. They have the power to tax and legislate, but their powers are drawn from provincial law which can be changed by a majority vote in the legislature. Ontario is in a tougher bind than most. Faced with a huge C$10 billion deficit when they came to power in 1995, the Conservatives slashed spending and cut the deficit to C$7.7 billion in 1996/97, while easing some taxes. The Harris revolution has kept the government high in opinion polls, but public support has slipped recently, with backing for the Conservatives down to 37 percent in Metro Toronto, compared to 41 percent for the opposition Liberals. ""My sense is they cannot ignore the referendum results,"" said University of Toronto political scientist Graham White. ""Now that doesn't mean they will abandon the bill or even change it in a substantive way. There is not a lot of room for tinkering,"" White said. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa, who plans to ban foreign donations to political groups, was strongly criticised on Saturday after he acknowledged having donated money to Britain's Conservative Party. Critics labelled Tung a hypocrite and accused him of double standards, saying his credibility as Hong Kong's leader after China takes it back from Britain on July 1 was now at stake. Tung's office confirmed a front-page report in the English-language South China Morning Post that he had donated 50,000 sterling (US$81,500) to the Conservative Party before Britain's April 1992 general election. The disclosure comes at a sensitive time, just days after Tung launched plans to ban foreign donations to political parties in Hong Kong after the handover on the grounds that he did not want foreigners meddling in local politics. ""As a person, I have in the past made modest donations to the Conservative Party,"" Tung said. ""This is a fact well-known to everybody and, as a result, I am particularly sensitive that this should not happen in Hong Kong."" A Tung aide told the newspaper that billionaire Tung had made the donation in a personal capacity when he was chairman of shipping group Orient Overseas (International) Ltd. He resigned from that position last October to run for leader after Governor Chris Patten leaves the British colony. Tung was appointed by Patten as a member of the executive council, or inner cabinet, in October 1992, the same year he donated the sum to the Conservatives. Tung's critics on Saturday took aim at him. ""It's really too much for him to do it and then say others cannot do it. It's a question of hypocrisy and double standards and sort of saying 'don't do as I do, do as I say,'"" legislator and pro-democracy activist Emily Lau told Reuters. Tung could see his credibility suffer, said law professor Nihal Jayawickrama at the University of Hong Kong. ""It must affect his credibility if you take up high ground and then you're shown up as having done previously what you are now preaching against,"" he told Reuters. ""If he had such strong views about foreigners getting involved in election campaigns and party funds then why did he do that, did it create so much damage to the British system?"" ""And if it didn't create damage to the British system, why does he think it'll create damage to the Hong Kong system?"" The news coincided with a diplomatic coup scored by Martin Lee, leader of the popular Democratic Party, who met United States President Bill Clinton at the White House in Washington on Friday. Tung, who previously enjoyed a high popularity rating, has seen his ratings fall in recent weeks, particularly after he launched plans to curb public demonstrations as well as the ban on foreign funding, which he argued were for ""national security."" If his plans go ahead, police permission will be needed to hold protests, while police need only be notified now. Meanwhile, an unarmed advance party of 40 soldiers from China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) will arrive on Monday to prepare in advance the logistics for the Chinese garrison that will replace British troops on July 1. Many of Hong Kong's 6.4 million people fear the PLA, recalling the bloody 1989 military crackdown on student activists in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. ","TanEeLyn"
"The Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) on Wednesday appealed for food aid for flood-hit North Korea, predicting disaster by the end of the year if relief did not arrive. ""The country is running out of food...they are emptying their warehouses now,"" Ole Gronning of Denmark, IFRC representative in North Korea, said in an interview in Beijing. ""We will have a human disaster at the end of the year if the food (aid) is not coming,"" said Gronning, who had been in North Korea since last November. ""(By) July...there will be no food in the country."" Devastating floods in 1995 and 1996 left half a million North Koreans homeless out of a total of 23 million, according to relief organisations. The floods have struck hard at the economy of the hermit communist state, destroying rice fields, roads, factories and livestock and swamping mines. North Korea was forecast to consume 5.5 million tonnes of grain in 1997, but Pyongyang feared a shortfall of 45 percent, or up to 2.5 million tonnes, Gronning said. ""We already now know that the harvest will not be successful...,"" he said. On Monday, North Korea admitted that it had only half the grain needed to feed its people. Food rations across North Korea had dropped to less than a quarter of the level normally considered essential to maintain a healthy population, Gronning said. There was no indication yet of famine but grain rations had been cut to 100 grams (3.5 ounces) per person a day -- equivalent to 900 calories -- from 450 grams (15.9 ounces). ""Signs of malnutrition are there,"" he said. The IFRC aimed to raise $10 million to feed 139,000 of the worst hit victims for 11 months through October this year, but so far only $1 million had been raised, Gronning said. About 5.2 million North Koreans were directly affected by the 1995 floods and a further 3.3 million last year. Two earlier appeals for funds totalling more than $10 million had largely been met. Photographs taken by Gronning in North Korea showed what he said was arable land under one metre (yard) of sand. About two percent of North Korea's farmland had been completely destroyed, covered with sand several metres deep, Gronning said. Lack of machinery made reclamation of sand-covered arable land difficult. North Korea was ""very exposed"", he said, adding that floods and hailstorms could strike again. Pyongyang's arch-rival South Korea has been one of the 25 donor countries, pledging 1,000 (corrects from 100,000) tonnes of wheat flour and 15,000 pairs of socks. ""South Korea is coming in very big this year,"" he said. Seoul suspended food shipments to North Korea after accusing Pyongyang of landing 26 commandos from a submarine last September. All but two of the group died during a manhunt. The aid resumed after North Korea apologised and South Korea returned the remains of the infiltrators. In January, the United States gave permission to Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc, the world's largest private grain trading company, to export 500,000 tonnes of wheat or rice to North Korea in what was expected to be a barter agreement.

"Hewlett-Packard Co., seeking to extend its position as a leader in electronic commerce, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire VeriFone Inc. in a stock swap worth $1.18 billion. Hewlett-Packard said VeriFone, a leader in electronic payment hardware and software, will be operated as an independent unit of HP. Verifone stockholders will receive one HP share for each VeriFone share, the company said. The acquisition is a big step in HP's drive to develop products for what it calls the ""on-ramps"" and ""off-ramps"" of the information superhighway, a business that includes computer printers and scanners, where Hewlett-Packard already has a dominant market share. In an intervew last week the company's top Internet executive, Ira Goldstein, said Hewlett-Packard aimed to become the information appliance supplier to the fast-growing market for Internet technology. The Internet portion of the electronic commerce market alone is expected to reach $95 billion in the United States by the year 2000, according to research by International Data Corp. HP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year. The acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. As of Monday, VeriFone had 23.3 million shares of common stock outstanding, the companies said. HP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues. Verifone jumped $17.625, or 59 percent, to $47.75 in very heavy trading on the NYSE, after initially being halted, as investors priced in the value of the stock swap. Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone, which was founded in 1981 and pioneered automated credit card transaction systems, has recently expanded to include conducting business over the Internet and ""smart-card"" products for homes. Smart cards have imbedded computer chips that can store so-called electronic cash and other information. Just last week, Citicorp's Citibank launched a pilot programme with VeriFone to test smart card use that will allow selected customers to download funds onto smart cards using devices in the home or office. VeriFone estimates that its systems handled more than $520 billion of the $800 billion in electronic transactions conducted in the United States last year. HP said the two companies' technologies complement each other, with HP's focus on Internet security technologies and major corporate markets melding with VeriFone's expertise in moving money. ""Central to HP's strategy to achieve this vision is the ability to move money securely from end to end over the Internet, an area VeriFone has pioneered through products and strategic relationships,"" HP Executive Vice President Rick Belluzzo said. The companies' relationship also includes providing products for the Visa/MasterCard Secure Electronic Transaction protoco, which is beginning to roll out this year, for secure credit-card payments over the Internet.

Hatch predicted the Danka-Kodak deal on Monday would bring pricing pressures to the copier business. ""Suffice to say that Danka has been aggressive, and will continue to be aggressive,"" Hatch said. According to Danka chief executive Dan Doyle, the acquisition and a 10-year alliance with Kodak will give high-flying Danka a full line of copiers to offer low, middle and upmarket customers around the world. Kodak is retaining its manufacturing and development operations in copiers, as well as some key technology. The remaining Kodak businesses will have about $600 million a year in sales, or a third of its former turnover. Danka will be its main customer as the primary distributor of Kodak copiers and printers. ""Danka's growth will be our growth,"" said Kodak co-chief operating officer Carl Kohrt. Kohrt predicted Kodak's rump copier businesses would be profitable by the end of 1997 and that the transaction, netting Kodak about $600 million in cash, would be immediately accretive to earnings. The deal should close by December 31. Analyst Gary Schneider of Bear Stearns said he had hoped Kodak would have quit copiers entirely and will have to prove to Wall Street it can turn around the financial performance of the remaining copier businesses. ""The question is what kind of normalized earnings can you get out of those,"" he said. Monday's deal is just the latest bit of corporate trimming at Kodak, which has spun off and sold businesses, generating some $8 billion. The company has in the 1990s exited pharmaceuticals, household goods and chemicals. The company said last winter it wanted to exit or reposition its copier businesses because its financial performance was subpar and promised little hope for a turnaround as it stood. Kohrt said the deal with Danka will stimulate sales of Kodak copiers. ""What we've really needed is pull-through from the market,"" he said. Danka chief executive Dan Doyle said Kodak's strong focus on big customers needing high-volume copiers and services dovetailed with Danka's traditional presence among low and middle-market customers. News of the deal boosted Danka's American Depositary Receipts, which closed up 6-5/8 at 36-1/2. Kodak closed down 1/2 at 71-3/4. ","MichaelConnor"
"Wm. Wrigley Jr Co said Thursday it is looking for ways to help revitalize the domestic chewing gum market, which saw about a one percent drop in physical sales volume in 1996. ""We have to bring new news to the category...either in advertising, merchandising (or) improved products,"" William Piet, vice president of corporate affairs and corporate secretary, said in an interview after a presentation at an analysts' conference here.   Piet cautioned that last year's decline in the overall domestic chewing gum market does not signal ""a disaster,"" adding that the industry has been growing at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent. ""It's a knock on the door,"" Piet said of the decline. Despite the decline in the domestic market, Wrigley's chewing gum brands at the end of 1996 surpassed about a 50 percent market share, up a little more than one point.   North America accounts for roughly 46 percent of Wrigley's business, but Wrigley continues to grow overseas. This year it will add Cambodia to the list of some 120 countries where it sells products. Cambodia will be supplied out of a new replacement factory in the Philippines, along with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Wrigley also plans to begin construction this spring for a new factory in Russia. That plant, which was previously announced, is expected to be in operation in early 1999. With the Russia facility, Wrigley will have plants in 13 countries outside the United States. Piet said growth in the international market varies from year to year, but said over 10 years the growth rate has been about four times that of the domestic market.

"Canada's Barrick Gold Corp on Monday dropped out of the race to control the vast Busang gold find in Indonesia, losing a long battle for the right to mine the deposit to U.S.-based Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc. But analysts warned that the struggle to control Busang, possibly the world's biggest gold deposit, may not have ended. Placer Dome Inc, another big Canadian mining concern, said it has not given up hope of grabbing a piece of Busang. ""This thing is far from over,"" said Fred Ketchen, vice-president of Toronto brokerage ScotiaMcLeod. Calgary's Bre-X Minerals Ltd, which discovered the 71-million-ounce Busang gold find, announced on Monday it had reached a deal with Freeport, shortly before an Indonesian government deadline was due to expire. Under the deal, Freeport will own 15 percent of Busang find, Bre-X will keep 45 percent and Indonesian interests will take 40 percent. The deal convinced Barrick, which has spent months negotiating for control of Busang, to give up its quest. ""We put forward our proposal last week and said to Bre-X that if you can find a better deal, we wish you success,"" said spokesman Vince Borg. ""For us to go beyond the proposal would not be in the best interest of our shareholders."" He declined to elaborate on Barrick's final offer, citing a confidentiality agreement. Many details needed to evaluate the Freeport deal remained a mystery on Monday, causing confusion in the stock market. Bre-X said Freeport, based in Louisiana, will provide US$400 million or 25 percent of the capital costs of the Busang project. Freeport will borrow US$1.2 billion to fund the rest of the costs. But neither Bre-X nor Freeport would say how much would be paid to Bre-X. ""We're not making a comment until the (Indonesian) government announcement tomorrow,"" said a Freeport spokeswoman in New Orleans. Since Bre-X did not mention any compensation from Indonesian interests or Freeport, observers have to assume there will be none, analysts said. Most analysts put a C$25 to C$30 target on Bre-X shares. The shares opened at C$25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday and sank quickly to C$23.50 by midafternoon. ""This has been very expensive for Bre-X. But Freeport has a pretty good deal here,"" said Rick Cohen, gold analyst at Goepel Shields in Vancouver. The government of Indonesian President Suharto is expected to respond on Tuesday to the proposed deal. Freeport and Bre-X need government approval before going ahead. ""It's a tremendous loss for Barrick,"" said Cohen. Barrick, the world's second biggest gold producer, had manouevred aggressively to grab control of Busang, spending months negotiating with Bre-X and Indonesian officials. It formed an alliance with Suharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and used its powerful advisory board -- which includes former U.S. president George Bush and former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney -- to cultivate ties with other influential Indonesians. Meanwhile, Placer Dome's chief executive officer, John Willson, said his company would re-evaluate its US$5 billion offer to merge with Bre-X, but would still be willing to use its financial resources and expertise to help develop Busang. ""Given the size, complexity and importance of Busang to Indonesia, we remain prepared to contribute our financial resources and unique mine development capabilities to this very attractive project,"" Willson said. ""Naturally, we are disappointed by the news that we were not selected as the developer and operator."" If the Indonesian government grants Bre-X and Freeport the right to develop Busang, Bre-X could quickly become a takeover target for a large company that would not mind allowing Freeport operate the mine, analysts said. But Barrick is unlikely to jump back into the race, said gold analyst Chad Williams with Research Capital in Montreal. ""I think Barrick would be apprehensive of buying out Bre-X because Bre-X is not the operator. It would be more amenable to Placer Dome."" ","HeatherScoffield"
"Any sweeping settlement among state governments and tobacco companies would leave standing a great many anti-smoking suits, including a $5 billion claim scheduled for a June 2 trial, plaintiff lawyers said on Friday. ""It's a lousy settlement for my clients and the American people,"" said Stanley Rosenblatt, one of two lawyers pressing the Broin class-action suit here on behalf of flight attendants claiming injuries from secondhand tobacco smoke.   Rosenblatt's case goes to trial on June 2 and is a landmark, because it is both the first class-action suit against cigarette makers to survive preliminary legal challenges and the first trial of a claim of damage from second-hand smoke. Some 1,000 anti-tobacco lawsuits currently exist in U.S. courts against tobacco companies, according to Richard Daynard of the Tobacco Products Litigation Project at Northeastern University.   Norwood Wilner, another Florida attorney who secured a $750,000 jury judgment against the Brown &amp; Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries Plc in 1996, has no plans to delay his next trial, said his legal aide, Jenny Stieger. ""We have a trial date of August 4, for another lady with lung cancer,"" Stieger said. Wilner on May 5 lost a suit on behalf of smoker Jean Connor, who was killed by lung cancer, against RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.   Reynolds, the maker of Winston and Salem brand cigarettes, will also be the defendant in the August trial on the claim of Joann Karbinyk, Stieger said. Another anti-tobacco lawyer, Ronald Acosta, has two tentative trial dates scheduled for summer in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida. Wilner expects to try still another case in November, Stieger said.   Other cases expected to come to trial in 1997 include another class-action on behalf of Florida smokers in September and a secondhand smoke case in Mississippi brought by the family of a non-smoking barber who allegedly died of cancer caused by the cigarette smokers awaiting haircuts in his shop. According to published reports, in part challenged by Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, tobacco companies and the 29 state governments suing the industry for billions in healthcare spending on smokers are near a deal limiting the number and type of lawsuits which could be brought by smokers.   The Wall Street Journal said the proposed terms would make it nearly impossible for future smokers to sue cigarette makers for lung cancer and other common tobacco-related illnesses. ""The global settlement is not a done deal,"" said Stieger. ""There is not a whole lot of support for a deal messing with the tort system."" Attorney Rosenblatt said during a pre-trial hearing for the Broin class-action suit that the tobacco industry and the attorneys general would reach a settlement.  Tobacco lawyers would then go to ""a friendly court"" and ask it to halt the Broin trial.   ""I don't think that's going to be successful, but that's the plan,"" he said. Michael Russ, a lawyer for Brown &amp; Williamson, told Reuters as the hearing broke for lunch: ""If that is the plan, I don't know about it.""

"Federal regulators and television broadcasters Thursday moved closer to agreeing on a stepped-up timetable for TV stations to begin providing high-definition digital broadcasts within 18 to 24 months. The issue has been a stumbling block in the Federal Communications Commission's plans to dole out to stations free digital TV licenses in the next two weeks. The new service promises crystal-clear pictures and CD-quality sound. Under pressure to jump-start the digital age, the National Association of Broadcasters and another industry group, the Association for Maximum Service Television, proposed that 31 stations in the 10 largest metropolitan areas begin broadcasting digital signals in 18 to 24 months. In some markets, up to four stations would be on the air in the shortened time frame. The top 10 markets include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and other cities. Broadcasters previously had suggested more time was needed, with many stations saying it would take six years to install the needed equipment and put the digital signals on the air. ""I welcome the increased level of commitment for launching digital television,"" said Commissioner Susan Ness, who is trying to broker a pact between the FCC and the broadcasters. She said the broadcasters' plans ""move the ball forward in a very substantial manner."" FCC officials stressed, however, that key details must be worked out -- in particular, how many digital broadcasts would begin over 18 to 21 months, something that is important to TV makers trying to offer digital sets in the key Christmas buying season. Twenty-four months would fall after Christmas 1998. TV set makers have said they would postpone offering digital sets an extra year if stations delayed significant introduction of digital broadcasts until 1999. Ness, as a result, said she has asked broadcasters to better detail TV stations' plans to be offering digital transmission by Christmas of next year. The roll-out schedule has been a key hurdle. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt had proposed that big network-owned stations in the top 10 markets start providing digital signals within the next year. That would translate into 26 large stations. Broadcasters said that was too quick. Hundt's office gave the broadcasters' latest plan a cautiously upbeat response. ""We're evaluting it. But obviously this is a very healthy dialogue between us and the industry,"" said Hundt's chief of staff, Blair Levin. Earlier this week Hundt sharply criticised broadcasters, questioning their commitment to digital TV. ""I'm beginning to wonder if broadcasters really want these licenses,"" Hundt told a meeting of the National Cable Television Association in New Orleans. ""A cynic would think that broadcasters just don't want someone else to have them."" An official in Commissioner James Quello's office endorsed the new proposal as an ""agressive roll-out."" Officials with Commissioner Rachelle Chong's office could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, the FCC still must determine the level of public-interest obligations to impose on TV stations in exchange for the digital licenses, as well as other issues. ","RogerFillion"
"China's decision to dramatically expand the number of companies listed on its B shares markets will help to finally make them a serious prospect for foreign investors, brokers said on Wednesday. The securities authorities on Tuesday unveiled a list of 33 companies given approval to offer foreign currency B shares and list them on the two domestic stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Last month, the authorities also named 38 companies for listing on overseas stock markets, most of which are expected to be listed as H shares in Hong Kong. ""They won't be able to list them all by the end of 1997, the volume is just too big,"" said Hoong Yik Luen of ING-Barings in Shanghai. ""But by mid-1998 if all goes well, the market capitalisation for B and H shares will be doubled or even tripled. Then the China market will become a serious market for international institutional investors,"" he said. John Crossman, chief representative of brokers Jardine Fleming in Shanghai, said that while the quality of the companies proposed for listing was not yet clear, the plan to speed up listings was at least a step in the right direction. ""The only way for this market to go forward is for there to be a bunch of new listings, to get the B share markets up to 200-330 listings, and get capitalisation up to $20-30 billion, somewhere where people will pay attention to it,"" he said. There are now 86 companies listed on the B share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with total market capitalisation of about US$3 billion. The new list, approved by the Securities Commission of the State Council (cabinet), includes refrigerator maker Qingdao Hai'er, Benxi Steel, Shenyang Petrochemical and Dalian Refrigerator. The companies selected are mostly large state-run industrial enterprises from sectors including electric power, transport, electronics, telecommunications, petrochemicals, textiles, light industry and pharmaceuticals. A local analyst with another foreign brokerage said the list of companies included no surprises and quite a few weak players. ""Bringing more companies to market is positive news but the companies have got to be good quality,"" he said. ""I'm personally not so satisfied with the candidates."" The B shares, denominated in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen, are reserved for foreign investors, but a large proportion are held and traded by local Chinese investors operating through a variety of loopholes. A spokesman for the Securities Commission was quoted as reaffirming the ban on local investors from holding B shares. ""I think people are saying it because it's the rules and the rules are to be respected,"" said a foreign brokerage analyst. ""But I don't think there will be vigorous enforcement.""

"UK bus to rail group Go-Ahead Group Plc said on Wednesday that allegations by opposition Labour MP Dale Campbell-Savours of company representatives using inside information to clinch a rail franchise and benefit through share dealings was ""rubbish."" In an interview with Reuters, Martin Ballinger, Go-Ahead managing director, hit back at the MP's allegation, which was made in Parliament late last night. It was  ""absolute tosh,"" he said. ""Nobody made any money as no-one sold (their shares).""   The comments were made in a statement by Campbell-Savours in the House of Commons, where Members of Parliament  (MPs) are protected from libel suits by parliamentary privilege. But Ballinger warned the Labour MP ""I would certainly get my lawyers to take a look at any statements, so he better be careful what he says outside the (House of) Commons."" ""The last MP who said something silly about us -- I've got his apology hanging in my loo (toilet). If Campbell Savours says this outside the House of Commons I'll have another framed apology to hang in the loo."" said the transport group chief. The allegations focus on its bid for the Regional Railways North East franchise, for which Go-Ahead was shortlisted on November 15. Ballinger explained that in the bidding process it put in an ""indicative' bid based on information which had more up-to-date accounts details because it had existing British Rail managers within its bid team. But Ballinger said that the franchise regulator Opraf had adjusted Go-Ahead's bid to bring the accounts information in line with other bidders. ""The final bids were all on basis of information available to all parties. There is no way we are in possession of price sensitive information -- that is rubbish,"" he said. ""The only thing available to us was the expertise of our managers."" He said the sharp rise in its shares in recent months had been in line with the rest of the sector which had rallied. Asked why Campbell Savours would make such accusations in light of Go-Ahead's defence, Ballinger replied: ""He wants to cast aspersions on the (Conservative government's) privatisation process and he likes to invent government sleaze."" -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","EdnaFernandes"
"Quickly expanding Republic Industries should meet full-year 1997 share-profit estimates of $0.70, Republic chief financial officer Mike Karsher said on Monday. All four Republic segments, including car retailing, performed well in the first quarter and the diversified services group expects to accelerate the pace of openings of its AutoNation used-car superstores in 1997, Karsher told Reuters.   But Karsher cautioned the four or five new superstores being added to the 1997 schedule would not add to 1997 full-year profits since the outlets typically incur initial losses until sales volume picks up. Republic is on an acquisition campaign. In the past six months it bought major car-rental agencies such as Alamo and car dealerships in many parts of the United States. For the first quarter, Republic reported a doubling of share profits to $0.08 from the same period in 1996. Karsher said the share profits were $0.01 higher than a consensus of Wall Street analysts forecasts.   Net income grew even faster to $28.9 million from $12.4 million as revenues rose to $1.504 billion from $1.016 billion. The company has greatly expanded its share base with its stock-swap acquistions and had average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 374 million, up from 283 million a year earlier. ""All four business segments had very good quarters,"" he said. Republic has opened three AutoNation stores so far in 1997 and had planned to open 10 more this year, but was adding four or five stores.

"French oil groups Total SA and Elf Aquitaine said on Monday that they had signed contracts with Iraq to buy crude oil under a United Nations oil-for-food deal with Baghdad. Total said it had signed a contract to take 30,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), conditional on United Nations approval. ""We reached an agreement with the Iraqis at the end of last week to take 30,000 barrels per day. We now await approval of the United Nations,"" a spokesman for Total said. At Elf Aquitaine a spokesman said the company had signed a three-month deal but declined to say how much oil it would take. ""I do not know whether we have permission from the UN overseers. We signed on Friday and have submitted it for approval,"" an Elf spokesman said. Under the U.N. programme, Iraq may sell $2 billion of crude oil to finance purchases of food and medicine to ease the plight of Iraqi civilians bearing the consequences of international economic sanctions. The plan was agreed in principle in May after months of negotiations but the U.N. delayed signing the deal after an Iraqi assault on Kurdish rebels until early this month. Under the plan, oil companies will reimburse Iraq for the oil through payments into an Iraqi account in New York to finance purchases of food and medicine. The strain on daily life is fuelling opposition to President Saddam Hussein. Two opposition groups in exile have claimed responsibility for an attack last week on Hussein's son Uday. Mitsubishi Corp of Japan was the first company on Monday to say it had signed a deal. It signed an accord on Friday to take 40,000 bpd. The United Nations has so far approved five contracts. U.S. firms Coastal Corp and Bay Oil on Sunday began lifting crude oil from the southern export outlet of Mina al-Bakr. Other companies granted U.N. approval include Turkish state oil company TUPRAS and Italy's Oil Energy. TUPRAS was the first to get U.N. permission. Much of the oil will be exported through a pipeline to Ceyhan in Turkey which opened last week. On Monday the first tanker with Iraqi oil left Ceyhan while tow tankers are loading at Mina al-Bakr. The French oil companies resumed contacts with Iraq shortly after the Gulf war and Elf is in talks to extract oil from the Majnoon field in southern Iraq -- with an estimated capacity of 300,000 bpd -- while Total wants to develop the giant Nahr Umar field which could have a capacity of 500,000 bpd. Elf and Total have been in talks with Iraq since 1992 and always worked within the framework of the 1990 United Nations sanctions imposed after the invasion of Kuwait. French firms are also lining up deals to sell wheat to Bagdad for the first time in six years. Traders will have to submit their offers on Tuesday for an auction to sell 100,000 tonnes in French wheat to Iraq for delivery in January and February. Iraq also tendered for between four and six cargoes of lower quality white sugar for delivery between mid-February and early March, sugar traders said. ","MarcelMichelson"
"Psion Plc, the British hand-held computer company, saw its shares plummet by almost one fifth on Monday as a slowdown in sales overshadowed the launch of a key new product it said was ""light years"" ahead of its rivals. The shares dived to close at to 407.5p, a loss of 97.5p or 19.2 percent, having hit an earlier low of 400p. Some analysts said the stock, which was also hit by concerns over the continued strength of sterling, could fall to as little as 350p over the next six months. Psion, which launched the first handheld Organiser 13 years ago, said its new chequebook-sized Series 5 product was the first fully-functional, pen-orientated, portable computer that fits into a hand -- driving palmtop computing into the 21st Century. But chairman David Potter conceded that the group's performance would be affected until the new 32-bit computers had become established. The statement was interpreted by some analysts as a potential profit warning. ""It's not inconceivable that Psion could earn less profit this year than last year,"" warned Keith Woolcock, analyst at brokers Merrill Lynch. The strength of sterling had knocked about three percentage points off gross margins and with the promise of a new product, sales of older computers had turned sluggish as customers held out for the new machines, analysts noted. ""The new machines will not be in a position to be sold in volumes before the autumn -- so Psion is going to have a big problem,"" Woolcock noted. The problem Psion faces is a familiar one. The company saw its profits fall in 1984, before it was floated, when it launched its Organiser and struggled to switch from one big selling product to another. But Woolcock said that while over-optimism ahead of the launch may have driven shares up too high, in terms of sophistication, the new computer was not in the same ""corner of the universe"" as those of its competitors. While rivals such as Microsoft Corp were introducing chaos into Psion's market, such a computer giant would only become a serious threat in one or two years, he added. ""The upside is that Psion can come through this,"" Woolcock said. ""We know that they now have some new partners...they have a great product, a good brand name and if Psion can position itself as an antidote to the blandness which Microsoft's products seem to represent -- it's got a great future,"" he said. Psion, which said it was initially selling 10,000 of the new computers each month, hopes to boost sales to nearly 40,000 by September or October. Potter told reporters in a telephone conference call that the new computer, which is compatible with Microsoft office products, Lotus Smartsuite and Corel/Wordperfect, was expected to account for nearly 40-50 percent of annual turnover by next year. Two models in the Series 5 range -- the 8MB and the 4MB, which are being retailed at 499.95 pounds ($817) and 439.95 pounds respectively -- will be available in 50 countries and eight languages.

"British television and national newspaper group United News &amp; Media Plc said on Friday its profit had risen 12 percent in an ""excellent"" first year following a merger which effectively doubled its size. A media heavyweight was created last year when United News, publisher of national newspapers The Express and Daily Star, joined forces with commercial television and financial services group MAI in a three billion pound ($4.8 billion) deal. The enlarged company said 1996 profit before tax and exceptional items rose 12 percent to 290.2 million pounds. Earnings per share increased 15 percent to 40 pence. ""I think we have delivered at the top end of expectations against the agenda we set ourselves at the time of the merger,"" chief executive Clive Hollick told Reuters. The profit figure was just ahead of most analysts' forecasts. United shares gained 9-1/2 pence to 750 by 1130 GMT, bucking the trend in a generally lower market. ""The review of the businesses following the merger has been completed, with adjustments to the portfolio in some areas and changed operating strategies in others,"" said Hollick, who moved across from MAI. United said savings as a result of the merger and subsequent restructuring were expected to reach 43 million pounds a year by 1998. It took an exceptional charge of 56 million pounds last year, mainly stemming from the merger. The company has been active on the disposals and acquisitions front, spending more than 750 million pounds last year as it bought exhibitions group Blenheim and a 29.9 percent stake in regional television broadcaster HTV. It recouped around 300 million by selling a finance company, a legal publisher and local newspaper interests. United, which operates commercial television (ITV) franchises in southern and eastern England, said operating profit from its broadcasting and entertainment division rose by 36 percent to almost 60 million pounds. Profit from the business services unit increased by 38 percent to 100.5 million but the contribution from financial services fell slightly to 51.1 million. Earnings from consumer publishing dropped 7.5 percent to 81 million after a 31 million pound increase in paper costs. Hollick said restructuring of the national newspapers should bring annual savings of 15 million pounds, some of which would be ploughed back into the titles. The mid-market Daily and Sunday Express titles have been relaunched as a combined seven-day operation in a bid to end a long-term sales decline. United said trading in early 1997 was ""well in line with expectations"".

"Holding company Cie de Suez  and utility Lyonnaise des Eaux must tell shareholders how they will benefit from the groups' planned merger, otherwise the deal will look like a defensive move, analysts said on Friday. The boards of Suez and Lyonnaise are expected to approve later on Friday terms of the merger which will create a group with annual sales of about 200 billion francs ($35 billion) and a market capitalisation of 75 billion. But size is not necessarily a bonus if the new group cannot bring operating companies together and if Suez is not allowed to sell Belgian financial assets to shed its conglomerate status and focus on utilities. ""If there is no link-up between Lyonnaise and Suez, the merger makes little sense. It looks like a defensive move,"" a share analyst said. Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod told Europe 1 radio on Friday that the new group would have four core businesses -- energy, water distribution, waste management and communications. ""What do shareholders stand to gain?"" a second analyst asked. ""There is still uncertainty,"" he added. In the short term, Suez shareholders can look forward to  a big cash payout as part of the merger terms, with a dividend estimated at around 24 francs per share, or a total of some 3.8 billion francs. They are also getting a chance to cut the discount on Suez shares compared with underlying assets -- if the new group buries Suez's holding company image by selling financial assets to concentrate on utilities, as promised. Suez investors will also gain by getting shares in Lyonnaise, which for all its past weakness, is one of France's biggest companies and harbours big expansion ambitions. But Suez holders still need to be convinced on big issues related to the merger. The merger is being structured as a Lyonnaise takeover of Suez, apparently to take advantage of Suez's tax loss carry-forward, which would shelter future profits of the new group. ""This needs to be clarified,"" said an analyst. For Lyonnaise shareholders, the deal looks more risky. They do not know if Suez chairman Gerard Mestrallet has made guarantees of management freedom to the Belgian government for the Societe Generale de Belgique holding company, which groups choice industrial and financial assets. Any commitments may inhibit SGB's disposal of Belgian financial assets, which include stakes in banking giant Generale de Banque and insurer Fortis. French investment in Belgium has become a sensitive issue since Renault SA's decision to close its Vilvoorde plant near Brussels at heavy cost to jobs. The Belgian authorities insist on keeping the Tractebel utilities company, 50.3 percent owned by SGB, independent and headquartered in Belgium. This may limit the scope for integrating Tractebel into Lyonnaise's global ambitions. Howver, Tractebel could benefit from asset transfers from Lyonnaise, such as the Elyo energy subsidiary. The disposal of Suez's French financial units such as consumer credit house Sofinco, property broker Banque Monod and insurer Henin Vie, pose less of a problem. Credit Agricole, which last year bought Banque Indosuez, has an option to buy 20 percent of Sofinco next year. Lyonnaise shareholders stand to gain an injection of fresh capital which the company needs to finance its global aspirations. But if the Suez disposals do not go according to plan, they will be left with a conglomerate on their hands, with the accompanying discount on the shares. ($ = 5.789 French Francs) ","PierreTran"
"Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison late Thursday confirmed he has formed an independent investor group to gauge interest in taking over troubled Apple Computer Inc. The move, which is not the first time Ellison has raised the possibility of personally leading a bid for Apple, comes as the computer maker is struggling to recapture a profitable role in the intensely competitive PC industry. The stock of Apple Computer Inc. rose in heavy trading Thursday, closing up $1.875 at $18.625 in Nasdaq trading after a newspaper reported that Ellison had renewed his interest in leading a takeover of Apple. Ellison issued a statement late Thursday saying he and ""an undisclosed investor group"" had set up an e-mail address at savapple(at)us.oracle.com to test investor support for an acquisition of Apple. ""Presuming the successful acquisition of Apple by the Ellison investor group, what do you believe should be its single top priority?,"" was among the questions Ellison asked. Ellison, a flamboyant software billionaire, has said for two years he would like to buy Apple with his own money, partly to prevent Microsoft Corp. from dominating the computer industry. He restated his interest in acquiring control of the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker in an interview with the San Jose Mercury News, saying he would seek to raise $1 billion to buy a majority stake in Apple. Although Ellison said any bid would be independent of Oracle, the database company's stock fell $1.125 to $39.375. Apple and Oracle were among the market's most active issues. Based on its stock price, Apple is worth $2.17 billion. Ellison's stake in Oracle is worth about $6 billion. Ellison said that based on the reaction from Apple investors, he will decide soon whether to make a bid in the next few days. Previously, he has said he approached unidentified big investors about a joint bid. He also has mulled the idea with his friend Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who was kicked out of the company in 1985 and returned in December as a part-time adviser to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio. Ellison could not be reached in person for comment. Katie Cotton, Apple spokeswoman, said the company had no comments about Ellison or his prospective bid. Wall Street analysts said they doubted Ellison actually would attempt to buy Apple because he has not taken any concrete steps in the two years that he has expressed an interest. ""The deal doesn't make sense for (any outside investor) to take him up on it,"" said David Wu, analyst at investment bank ABN Ambro Chicago Corp. Still, Ellison's comments should not be dismissed, some analysts said. ""It would be a mistake to analyze this as a pure business issue, as there is substantial ego involved,"" said Paul Saffo, a tracker of Apple and Ellison and a research fellow at Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley think tank. Ellison, the third-richest software tycoon behind Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen, is intent on slowing Microsoft's dominance of the software industry, he has said in recent interviews. Apple, with its huge following of Macintosh fans, could be a key weapon. Saffo also said Jobs, since returning to Apple late last year after it acquired his Next Software Inc., has been very influential in trimming the company, and could be ""sprucing up"" Apple for an acquisition. Apple has suffered declining market share for its famous brand of easy-to-use computers and endured several rounds of restructuring in recent years. The stock has languished in the mid-teens since early January and is at a 10-year low. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Anglo-U.S. conglomerate Hanson Plc Thursday reported a record 1.8 billion British pounds ($2.9 billion) in pretax profits for the last fiscal year before it began a four-way split of its operations on Oct. 1. The group spun off Imperial Tobacco and Millennium Chemicals in the fall. Its energy group is due to be spun off by February, leaving behind the building group. The final results showed profits topping forecasts and up sharply from 1.22 billion ($1.98 billion) last year. But the figures were inflated by a one-time gain of 609 million pounds ($989 million), compared with a charge of 98 million pounds ($159 million) last year. Earnings per share were 25.6 pence (14.6 cents) vs. 18.2 pence (29.5 cents) and a dividend of 1 pence (1.6 cents) will be paid. Of the two divisions that will remain, building materials and equipment saw profits slip to 231 million pounds ($375 million) from 237 million ($385 million). Sales were 2.45 billion ($3.98 billion) vs. 2.1 billion ($3.4 billion). The British arm continued to suffer from tough housing and construction markets, but some signs of a turnaround were evident. Buoyant U.S. conditions helped to outweigh the negative effects of the British building market. Energy enjoyed sharply higher profits, with strong growth overseas and a further gain in British profit and market share. The surge reflected Eastern electricity company's first full contribution since its takeover. Peabody Coal saw profits slip to 154 million pounds ($250 million) from 160 million pouinds ($260 million) as it sought to raise productivity levels. Lord Hanson, chairman and co-founder of the empire in the throes of the four-way split, said prospects for its ""family of companies"" was very good. But he was less happy about the progress of its share price performance which he said was ""very disappointing."" The combined value of Hanson and the demerged companies was 195 pence ($3.17) on Dec. 1, 1995 and now stands at 150 pence ($2.43), said the chairman. ""This in no way represents either our earning capacity or future prospects,"" he said. ""Hanson's profit in each of the last five years has comfortably exceeded 1 billion sterling ($1.6 billion) and this year's result shows clearly that the momentum continues."" Christopher Collins, Hanson vice chairman said in an interview that the market should take a longer view in judging the Hanson companies' value. ","EdnaFernandes"
"Versant Object Technology Corp, a database software company, expects to do more business with MCI Communications Corp despite a stalled project last summer, Versant's chief executive said. ""We anticipate ongoing business from MCI,"" said David Banks, CEO of Versant, based in Menlo Park, Calif. ""They are still a customer of ours. They are using our licenses in existing projects and there are new projects on the horizon.""   A lot is riding on Versant's relationship with MCI. Ever since the long-distance phone company put a major project to revamp its billing system on hold, Versant's stock has been in a funk. Versant was supplying MCI with some of the fundamental software for the project. So when MCI last summer halted work to re-evaluate the project, code-named Horizon, investors assumed the worse about Versant and guessed the software company was the cause of the snafu, analysts said.   Versant's stock plummeted from a high of 28-3/8 in late November to as low as 8 three weeks ago. On Tuesday, Versant was unchanged at 14-3/4. In 1996, Versant's sales of software to MCI totaled about $4.8 million, or about 26 percent of the $18.4 million reported for the year. ""There have been rumors going around Wall Street implying that the relationship between MCI and Versant went sour,"" said James Mendelson, an analyst at brokerage SoundView Financial. ""I don't believe Versant was at fault.""   Banks said he could not discuss the technical details of Horizon, or why it was halted, because of a confidentiality contract with MCI. An MCI spokesman said the company simply decided to change the goals of the project, and would not comment about Versant's performance. But analysts said MCI's actions speak louder than words. Even though MCI never finished Horizon, MCI paid Versant all the money the software company was due. In June, MCI placed a $3.9 million order for Versant software to revamp its billing system. In September, MCI told Versant that it was re-evaluating the project. So Versant decided not to recognize revenue from the project in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, MCI renegotiated terms of the contract with Versant and paid the software company $4.4 million. ""MCI met all their financial obligations,"" Banks said. MCI also is still using Versant software, but Banks declined to say how much more revenue his company would receive from MCI. Mendelson said he expects Versant's revenue to nearly double in 1997 to $30 million as the company finds new customers outside of the telecommunications industry. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Czech ultra-right Republicans staged a small but noisy demonstration as German Chancellor Helmut Kohl arrived to sign a post-war reconciliation accord between the Czech Republic and Germany on Tuesday. About a hundred supporters of the Republican Party yelled ""go home"" and ""Czech lands for the Czechs"" as Kohl arrived at Prague's Liechtenstein Palace to sign a joint declaration with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. Other protesters carried banners with slogans such as ""No more Munich"" -- a reference to the 1938 Munich Agreement which ceded the Sudetenland, then part of Czechoslovakia, to Germany. Kohl waved to the demonstrators as he entered the palace. In the accord, Bonn expresses its sorrow for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague its regret for Czech brutality in the post-war expulsion of some 2.5 million Sudeten Germans. It also includes German support for Czech membership of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Orgainsation. ""This document has only one aim -- that is to finish Hitler's drive to the east and finalise the liquidation of our nation,"" Republican Party chairman Miroslav Sladek told the deomstrators. ""It is a revision of the results of the World War II,"" he said. The Republicans, who won 18 of the 200 seats in parliamentary elections last June, and the Communists, who won 22, oppose the accord. The communists say the declaration is a threat to Czech sovereignty. The Czech Republic is a leading contender to be one of the first new members of the EU and NATO. However, many Czechs are wary about joining a new alliance after the years of Nazi occupation and Soviet domination. One of the protestors, 64-year old Karel Valis, who said his parents were thrown out of Sudetenland when Hitler's Germany took it over, said Germans would use the declaration as a basis for taking over the Czech Republic. ""Since the 12th century Germans want to rule this area,"" he yelled. ""Next, Sudetens will want their property back."" The declaration does not provide direct compensation for Sudenten Germans' confiscated property. ","JanLopatka"
"EVA Air is planning to start a new freighter service from Taipei to Brussels later this year, airline spokesman K. W. Nieh has told Reuters. At the same time, the Taiwanese carrier is also planning to replace its McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter service from Taipei to Amsterdam via Dubai with an MD-11 Combi aircraft, Nieh said in an interview. ""We propose the new MD-11 freighter service to Brussels starting in May or June using the aircraft that is being replaced by the Combi aircraft on the Amsterdam service,"" Nieh said. In a further expansion of its cargo business, EVA will also take delivery of two more McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighters by the end of this year, along with the first of two new Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft, bringing EVA's all MD-11 freighter fleet to five. EVA's current fleet of 28 aircraft is due to rise to 34 by next year with the two MD-11 freighters and two 747-400 purchases along with two McDonnell Douglas MD-90 shorthaul passenger twinjets, Nieh added. He said the new freighters will be used to expand cargo revenue which is already expected to be more than 35 per cent of the airline's total revenue when last year's financial figures are published in March. EVA has not yet chosen which routes the two new freighters will operate on but Chicago is a possibility to supplement existing freighter services to New York and Seattle. EVA also operates Combi flights into Los Angeles and San Francisco, Nieh added. ""We hope we can use our new freighters to the United States but it depends on traffic rights and government negotiations regarding America's open skies policy. We hope an agreement can be reached later this year, once that happens we could apply for Chicago,"" Nieh said. EVA has no plans to start a dedicated freighter service from the Taiwanese capital to Hong Kong which is now served by 16 passenger flights a week partly using Combi aircraft, the spokesman added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"American Business Information Inc founder and chief executive officer Vin Gupta Thursday backed the First Call consensus forecast of $0.23 a share in third quarter earnings from continuing operations and $0.91 a share for the full year. ""I'm comfortable with that,"" Vin Gupta, founder and chief executive officer of the Omaha, Nebraska-based provider information on businesses said in response to both estimates. The estimates compare with $0.20 a share for the third quarter of 1995 and $0.80 a share for all of 1995.   American Business sells data to customers who use the information for sales leads.  While the information is publicly available, Gupta says it is not easy for individual businesses to find. While the company's stock fell to 10-1/2 from just under 15 after second quarter earnings were released, Gupta said in an interview that he bought about 200,000 shares in the company on July 16.  The company also bought back about 200,000 shares under a stock repurchase plan approved in June.   Gupta said he and his family own 56 percent of the stock and he manages the company for long-term value, eschewing dividends and higher margins to reinvest in technology, expand its sales force, develop products and make acqusitions. Those who sell at the first hiccup in earnings should stay away from the stock, he said. ""We don't take unnnecessary gambles,"" he said.  ""We don't bet the house.  So people who get nervous, I guess they don't belong in our stock.""   Gupta started the business in 1972 with a $100 investment, and expects sales of about $100 million in 1996, compared with $86.8 million in 1995. ""We have the most comprehensive, the most accurate database in the country now,"" he said.  Aside from phone directories and other sources, American Business makes about 14 million telephone calls to businesses each year to verify and gather more information.   Aside from selling directly to subscribers, the company also sells CD-ROM formats of its data and is now offering business profiles on the Internet at $3 a profile.  In the first three weeks that service, Lookup USA, was avaialble, about 100-120 profiles were sold each day, he said. In the next three years, Gupta sees $10-$20 million in revenues added from products on the Internet.  ""The Internet, the way its growing, I think could be a lot bigger,"" he said. Among future developments for the company, Gupta noted that its address database will be bundled with a Microsoft Corp mapping product soon to be released. He also said the company expects to be more active in the acquisition market. ""I would say that there's a good possibility that something could happen in the next two or three months,"" he said of acquisitions. --Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787 ","BradDorfman"
"The presumed death of geologist Michael de Guzman, who helped discover Indonesia's rich Busang gold site, on Wednesday shocked fellow prospectors and highlighted the dangers of their profession. De Guzman, chief geologist for Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd, fell out of a helicopter as he was returning to the Busang mine site in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province. Rescue crews were still searching the dense Borneo jungle for 41-year-old Filipino's body after he fell about 800 feet from the helicopter. ""It's very tragic and he will be remembered as a fine geologist,"" Bre-X Minerals chief executive David Walsh said in a telephone interview. De Guzman was a key member of the team which discovered Busang -- the richest gold find this century -- a few years ago. Bre-X has since agreed to develop the Busang site, valued at US$25 billion, with U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc and Indonesian partners. ""He (de Guzman) was a very respected geologist and well respected within the mining community,"" said Mario Steiner, president of Aerodat Inc, a geological survey company. Bre-X's stock was halted for several hours on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday before Bre-X issued a statement. The company's stock closed down 0.40 at 17.25 on volume of 5.2 million shares. Bre-X senior vice-president of exploration John Felderhof, who is currently in North America, will return to Indonesia, Walsh said. This is the latest tragedy involving Canadian mining and exploration companies in far-flung corners of the world. In October 1995, nine employees of Saskatoon-based Cameco Corp were killed in a helicopter crash in Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyzstan Air helicopter, chartered by a Cameco unit, was en route from the Kumtor gold mine when it went down. The families of the nine Canadians killed in the crash have said they plan to file a C$20.7 million lawsuit alleging Cameco and other defendants were negligent. Airborne surveyor Aerodat Inc has lost three aircraft since 1994, the latest in the dense eastern Amazon jungle of Peru. In September 1996, Falconbridge Ltd chief executive Franklin Pickard died of a heart attack while visiting the company's copper site high in Chile's Andes Mountains. ""It puts you in circumstances that maybe other jobs wouldn't put you in, but the industry has very high safety standards,"" said Tony Andrews, executive director of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada.

"The Czech crown, battered down by central bank comments in recent days, rebounded on Friday bolstered by a wave of foreign currency selling though dealers cautioned the market remains very nervous. In late afternoon trading, the crown was at 4.70 percent above its mark/dollar basket parity, up more than 50 basis points from the open but still some 80 basis points from Tuesday's record fixing at +5.51. ""Some bigger foreign players pushed the crown up, selling hard currency for crowns,"" said Jiri Ubry of ING Bank. Added Martin Strauch of Citibank: ""There were some break-even sellers in the market and the crown has now rebounded to near its peak before the central bank's comments."" One of post-Communist Europe's most stable currencies, the crown has consistently reached record highs in recent weeks, fuelled by demand brought about from a wave of more than 30 billion crowns in Eurobond issues since the start of the year. But the market made an about face on Wednesday after the central bank said it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary. The crown fell over 200 basis points against parity as many London traders bailed out over the next two days. Petr Korous of bank CSOB said some profit taking was also pushing the crown higher, and that there still appeared to be a large number of traders with long positions of hard currency against Czech crowns that may now sell off. ""When there were these comments from the central bank, a couple of big players may have bought hard currency because they had never held a long position before and got nervous,"" Korous said. ""It looks like now they are slightly losing patience and getting rid of their positions at slightly higher than what we saw just three days ago,"" he added. Dealers said they have seen few indications that the central bank was again on the verge of intervening, adding that they did not expect any action since the crown was not likely to rise above the five percent parity level. The CNB has not intervened directly on the market since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent. Few dealers predicted the crown would rise much further since the market was so nervous, but noted the crown appeared to have good support at around 4.5 percent above parity. ""It's tough to predict the crown's direction right now becuase it's so volatile in relation to any comments about it,"" said Citibank's Strauch. Korous also noted that the current stalemate in parliament where the ultra-right Republican and Communist opposition deputies have used stalling tactics to drag out debate for four days over a sensitive post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany could create more instability. ""I feel that we won't go to the levels we saw recently because there is some nervousness over the political scene here,especially when the ruling politicians have no idea how to eliminate the obstructions they are causing,"" he said.

"A group of 56 Chinese writers, former officials and academics has petitioned Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin to save cultural relics from the gigantic Three Gorges dam which would flood huge tracts of land. Ancient tombs and temples were threatened by a dearth of government funds and official under-reporting of those relics that warranted saving, according to the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters on Tuesday. ""The hearts of relic protection departments are like burning fire with 10,000 worries and misgivings,"" it said of the lack of funds. About 130 historical sites, some of them dating to the Stone Age, could be flooded as soon as next year. The sites include Qing dynasty (1644-1911) temples, an entire street from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and stone carvings from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220). Relocation of many relics had been delayed due to lack of funds, the letter said, adding that the damage would worsen unless government funds for relocation were provided. The letter dated August 8 was signed by prominent female writer Bing Xin, former ambassador to the United States Chai Zemin and former minister of culture Wang Meng. Others include Su Bingqi, president of the Archaeological Society, and Yu Weichao, curator of the Museum of Chinese History who is in charge of relocating relics. Archaeologists had designated 829 buried relics near a reservoir under construction as needing protection. The sites covered a total area of more than 20 million square metres (215 million square ft), but the government has agreed to protect one tenth of the area due to a lack of funds, it said. Some ancient tombs and relics have already disappeared under the onslaught of bulldozers, the letter said. Construction of the controversial dam was expected to submerge 632 square km (244 square miles) of land in central China's Hubei province and the southwestern province of Sichuan. It would force the relocation of 840,000 people from up to 200 villages and towns, according to 1991-92 estimates. Environmentalists have described the project as a potential ecological disaster, leading to the destruction of a scenic mountain region and the extinction of endangered species. The Three Gorges dam -- the world's biggest water control project --  was expected to ease seasonal flooding by creating a massive reservoir in Hubei to store waters from rains. The 6,000-km (3,500-mile) Yangtze river -- China's longest -- and its tributaries have triggered floods throughout much of China's history. The project, expected to cost $30 billion by its completion in 2009, would also help ease China's crippling shortage of electric power. ","BenjaminKangLim"
"Wheelabrator Technologies Inc indefinitely deferred a $350-million Dutch auction stock buyback because its parent company -- WMX Technologies Inc -- has no chief executive, said Wheelabrator chief financial officer Robert Gagalis on Tuesday. In an interview with Reuters, Gagalis said, ""We wanted to maintain some flexibility to get a new CEO up to speed on Wheelabrator's business and how it fits into WMX and all those kinds of things."" Shares in Wheelabrator were off one to 12-7/8.   Wall Street analysts said the Dutch auction deferral was a surprise that stirred new doubts about WMX and its majority owned Wheelabrator subsidiary. ""Whenever you put off something like this, it's just going to create uncertainty in investors' minds,"" said A.G. Edwards industry analyst Tore Stole. Wheelabrator, based in Hampton, N.H., had announced in February that it would increase its stock repurchase program to 30 million shares, including a Dutch auction to take place in the second quarter of this year. In a Dutch auction, a price is set, then lowered until a responsive bid comes in.   Analysts speculated that Wheelabrator may have been displeased with initial indications of prices likely to be paid in such an auction. But that was not the case, Gagalis said. ""The rationale for the change in strategy was tied to WMX's search for a new CEO,"" he said. The Wheelabrator auction was to have been just one part of a massive restructuring of WMX and affiliates that otherwise is progressing. The Waste Management Inc unit of WMX said last week it agreed to sell most of its Canadian assets to the Canadian unit of USA Waste Services Inc -- the latest step in WMX's plan to divest $1.5 billion in assets.   Under pressure from unhappy shareholders, WMX -- the largest U.S. garbage hauler -- also is in the process of finding a new chief executive, cutting 3,000 jobs, and doing its own Dutch auction for $1 billion. ""They're making progress,"" said Parker/Hunter industry analyst Richard Sporrer. Analysts were unsure about the broader meaning of the Wheelabrator deferral, especially when viewed in light of the resignation last month of WMX chief executive Philip Rooney, architect of the WMX restructuring strategy.   Tuesday's news could signal that Rooney's plans are being back-burnered, said Edward Jones analyst William Fiala. ""It would make sense because they're going to have a new CEO ... and they're going to want him to have more say in the decisions affecting the future of the company,"" Fiala said. Gagalis said he is unaware of any further impending delays or changes in the WMX shake-up. He said WMX plans to proceed with its own, $1-billion Dutch auction in April. ""In terms of all the other aspects of the WMX plan, I think everything else is being implemented as previously announced,"" Gagalis said. Sporrer said, ""Not having a CEO will stretch out to some degree the restructuring efforts they've been talking about. But I don't think it will be material ... Waste Management has spent a lot of time thinking through these changes. I don't think they're going to back off."" ((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787)) ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"Australian corporate profits, largely in line with expectations in the latest earnings season just finished, are on the mend after 18 months of disappointment, analysts said. Overall earnings still fell but analysts are optimistic that profits for the year to June 30 should show an overall rise as economic growth gathers pace and commodity prices trend higher. The results also reflected cost cutting, as companies tear into costs to deliver earnings growth in Australia's low inflation environment, analysts said.   Craig Drummond, head of research at brokers J.B. Were &amp; Son, said earnings per share (EPS) for industrial companies was 1.7 percent up while resource company EPS was down four to five percent. The drop in resource earnings, due mainly to lower commodity prices and a higher Australian dollar, pulled overall earnings slightly down, Drummond said. He said this corporate earnings season marked the end of disappointing profits that industrial groups have posted over the past 18 months. He said both industrial and resource profits should rise in the second half of 1996/97 and calendar 1998.   ""The market is not really worried about this half year result and we should start with banks having reasonable results in May,"" Drummond said. Three of Australia's four largest banks, National Australia Bank Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, are to report their 1996/97 first half results in May. David Rees, equity strategist at brokers BT Securities: ""I think compared with 12 months ago there have been a lot of signs of improvement. I think compared with what people were expecting, ... it is pretty close to line ball.""   Commonwealth Bank of Australia, pastoral and energy group Wesfarmers Ltd and retailers Woolworths Ltd and Coles Myer Ltd all reported better-than-expected profits. ""I think what is important for the market is what happens next and our view is that given the evidence of cost cutting and restructuring, given what has happened, we are looking for improvements across a whole range of companies,"" Rees said. Rees said there should also be earnings improvements coming from the growth in Australia's capital expenditure (capex), which the government expects to be about 17 percent for 1996/97.   ""What we are now looking for is the follow through from capex ... to the bottom line,"" Rees said. Analysts said many companies improved their 1996/97 half profits by cost cutting. Marcus Tuck, economist at HSBC James Capel, said: ""Generally the cost cutting has been good and you could say that managers are slowly learning to deal with a low inflation environment."" Australia, which has enjoyed 22 quarters of continuous economic growth, has only seen three quarters with inflation rates above five percent and has had 12 quarters since June 1991 with an inflation rate below two percent.   With the results season out of the way, investors are currently more concerned about the outlook for U.S. interest rates, said Mark O'Brien, head of equities at Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP). ""The results that have been coming out having been largely in line. Very quickly once they (investors) realised the results weren't going to be disappointing, they turned their attention to U.S. interest rates,"" O'Brien said. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","KevinMorrison"
"U.S. Midwestern local telephone company Ameritech Corp. said Friday it was in merger or acquisition talks with several European security monitoring firms worth $200 million to $500 million each. ""There are some serious negotiations going on,"" Ameritech's international affairs director Dennis LaComb told Reuters. Chicago-based Ameritech hopes to double its current $4.0 billion in European investments over the next few years, said LaComb, who said he was in London until Saturday on a ""courtesy visit."" ""The majority of our investment internationally is in Europe. This is a very important area for us,"" he said. Over the past six years, the Midwestern ""Baby Bell"" has taken stakes in privatisations abroad in countries such as Hungary and New Zealand. LaComb said that security monitoring -- using telephone lines to link customers' home alarm systems to police stations -- was a natural business direction for the $31.3 billion telecommuications company to take. Ameritech, which is facing its first taste of competition in its local market, is the second-biggest U.S. security monitoring company and hopes to become the European market leader. The first deals are likely to be struck in Germany and France, although the company said it was also looking at firms in Scandinavia and was considering Britain. Unlike some of its sister Baby Bells, Ameritech has no current designs on becoming a global telecommunications player. Instead, it wants to focus its international strategy on regional telecommunications, communications such as alarm systems and exporting its knowledge of customer services and of operating in competitive markets to telecommunications firms, such as Portugal Telecom SA, which are on the verge of privatisation. Ameritech's foreign ventures so far include stakes in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand, a local, long distance and cellular phone and satellite television service provider, Poland's Polska Telefonia Komorkowa and Norway's NetCom GSM, two cellular telephone operators.

"U.S. computer software giant Microsoft Corp joined China's top personal computer maker on Tuesday in a licensing pact hailed by Beijing as proof it was serious about protecting intellectual property rights. Under the agreement, China's Legend Group will be allowed to pre-install the Chinese-language version of Microsoft's Windows 95 software in its personal computers. ""This shows the Chinese government's resolve to protect intellectual property rights,"" said Yu Zhongyu, chief engineer at the Ministry of Electronics Industry, speaking at the signing ceremony in Beijing. Other officials at the ceremony described the accord as one of the biggest signed since the United States and China reached an agreement last June on the protection of intellectual property rights, averting a trade war. Beijing agreed to protect intellectual property rights by moving to stamp out piracy that American firms had alleged was costing them $2.3 billion a year in lost sales. Computer software piracy figured prominently in last year's often heated Sino-U.S. discussions. The licensing pact could mean payments of about 100 million yuan ($12 million) by Legend to Microsoft over the next two years, if the Chinese company meets its sales targets, officials of the two companies said. Legend said it sold 200,000 personal computers last year and it is aiming to double that figure this year. Chinese government officials have said that about 1.8 million personal computers were sold overall in China last year. ""This is the most significant agreement Microsoft has signed in the People's Republic of China,"" said Charles Stevens, Microsoft vice president, Far East. The two companies described their agreement as part of a strategic partnership that pointed to further cooperation in future. The Windows 95 software to be installed in the Legend computers employs the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China. Legend Group controls the Hong Kong-listed Legend. Legend officials said the income from the personal computers sold under the agreement with Microsoft would be largely reflected in the results of the Beijing operations. ","WilliamKazer"
"China showered the World Trade Organisation (WTO) with bouquets and blame on Tuesday, saying the body Beijing has long sought to join was important, but that it neglected poorer nations. A meeting of the WTO's 128 member states in Singapore this month had taken a lopsided approach to differing international needs, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang. ""This meeting finally reached a common understanding, but at the same time we should realise that the result of this meeting was not balanced enough,"" Shen told a news briefing. ""It mostly reflected the relations and interests of the developed countries,"" he said. Shen's comments came after the official China Daily newspaper published a front page report that suggested that after years of frustrated efforts to gain entry to the WTO, Beijing's enthusiasm was fading. ""Accession or not, China has become indifferent and doesn't care any more,"" it quoted Wu Jiahuang, director general of the customs administration's tariffs department, as saying. Wu compared China's decade-long bid for entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and current attempts to join the WTO that succeeded it to a ""sunken boat"" and an ""ailing tree"", the newspaper said. Western diplomats said Wu's comments were more a reflection of differing internal views on the importance of the global economy than a signal of a shift from Beijing's oft-stated desire for a seat in the world trade club. Asked about the China Daily report, Shen said it did not necessarily reflect Beijing's formal position. ""We still feel the World Trade Organisation is a very important international organisation, although of course if China is not taking part then we should say it is incomplete,"" he said. Beijing seeks to join the WTO on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries. But some members -- with the United States the most vocal -- argue that China's economy is too powerful to be given such treatment. Beijing says it must be allowed a relatively long transition period to prepare key industries for the fierce foreign competition they would face under the WTO's freer trade rules. China's leadership had concluded that negotiations with WTO members on its entry terms were politically tainted, Wu said. The high-profile publication of Wu's downbeat views on WTO accession could be aimed at signalling that China was in no hurry to make concessions on terms, but was more likely an expression of internal differences, said one Western diplomat. ""They have their different interest groups in China, just as we have,"" he said. ""There are those who are charged with administering the tariffs and taking in the receipts and those who have a longer-term perspective on the whole thing. ""It doesn't change the basic fact that those who are charged with representing China in this matter do give us a different impression,"" he said. Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation An Min was quoted on the inside pages of the China Daily as saying early entry could boost investment. ""Optimistically speaking, the problem could be solved next year,"" An said. ","MureDickie"
"Nobody expected Serge Tchuruk, chairman of electronics and telecommunications group Alcatel Alsthom, to sit and wait while the state made up its mind what to do with defence group Thomson-CSF. But his audacious move to try and line-up state-owned aerospace group Aerospatiale and Rafale fighter plane builder Dassault came as a surprise to many. Alcatel on Monday confirmed newspaper reports it was talking to the two plane makers about a Thomson offer. The link, if successful, would group most of France's defence electronics industry players in one camp, with Lagardere Groupe's Matra Defense Espace in the other. Other players, Sagem and Cie des Signaux, could join either camp at a later stage. For Tchuruk's gamble to win, however, the government has to decide to sell its 58 percent stake in Thomson-CSF in a private placement, and not through a market float. Alcatel Alsthom has defence businesses with some 10 billion francs in sales which would be transferred to Thomson-CSF, already a global player in defence electronics. Aerospatiale and Dassault, themselves in advanced merger talks, would transfer their missiles and electronics business to Thomson-CSF in exchange for a stake in the group under the Alcatel scheme being discussed, industry sources said. It would turn the remaining Aerospatiale-Dassault group into a pure aerospace ""platform"" company, with ties to one of the world's third biggest defence electronics groups. The enlarged Thomson-CSF would have annual sales of 60 billion francs, against some 35 billion francs currently. The government, as biggest shareholder in the future Aerospatiale-Dassault, has to allow this company to participate in a bid for another company majority-owned by the state. The merger of Aerospatiale with Dassault is expected to be concluded before the spring, after which the new group will be privatised itself. While the government has not publicly expressed its opinion on whether it would allow Aerospatiale to join a Thomson-CSF bid, it has had ample chances to express any opposition. In December, when the first news reports appeared about a possible Aerospatiale/Dassault interest in Thomson-CSF, the Defence and Finance Ministries said such reports were ""without foundation"" and ""premature"". Industry sources said that Tchuruk had informed all ministers involved about the possible link with the plane builders and they added that the fact Alcatel confirmed its discussions with the plane makers on Monday was a sign that Tchuruk had not been told to drop his plans. Tchuruk, a 59-year old Marseille-born weapons engineer, had already impressed the independent Privatisation Commission with the industrial logic behind his group's Thomson-CSF bid. But the government had in October selected Lagardere as preferred bidder because the Matra merger was the best solution for French defence interests. Meanwhile, Alcatel has confirmed its return to profits in 1996 after heavy losses due to one-off charges in 1995. It has sold its interests in mobile telecoms operator SFR and it is in talks to reduce its stake in Havas. Whether that will help convince the government to change its mind remains the question. On the Paris Bourse, Alcatel shares closed 1.09 percent lower -- after big gains late last week -- at 542 francs, while Lagardere fell 1.59 percent to 154.70 with traders citing concern it may not win Thomson.

"A electronic document language translator is expected to be commercially available within 18 months which will offer ""tremendous"" benefits for the air cargo industry, an electronic commerce specialist has told Reuters. The market development director for Hong Kong information processing firm CargoNet, Edi Leong, said the translator will mean a shopfloor worker in China will be able to read in Chinese a purchase order received from an American company in English and vice-versa. ""That will be a tremendous benefit to business and greatly speed things up because you automate the whole process and actually get down to the working level,"" Leong told Reuters in an interview. ""We are about 12-18 months away from it being commercially available. People all over the world have been working on a translator for a long time and some universities have developed a working model. There is an awful lot of work to be done but it's not too far off and the benefits will be out of this world when it comes,"" Leong added. Industry observers say there are tremendous difficulties in developing a Chinese to English translator because of the number and complexity of the characters and not every English word has a Chinese equivalent but agree the potential benefits are huge. Among CargoNet's shareholders is sea container specialists Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT) which is part of the Hutchison Group and Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents (HAFFA). - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"Shares in British supermarkets fell on Monday after a study said they were closer to a price war than they have been for 15 years. But analysts remain sceptical that stores will risk such a move, and supermarkets themselves appeared reluctant to sacrifice their profit margins. The study by research group Verdict adding to market worries after J. Sainsbury Plc, now replaced as Britain's favourite supermarket chain by Tesco Plc, warned last Friday that its profits would be hit by efforts to boost sales. Verdict said in a report prepared before Sainsbury's warning that profits would be 50 million pounds ($81.2 million) below expectations that risks of a price war were greater than at any time since 1982. Verdict analyst Clive Vaughan said Sainsbury's comments increased the probability to ""closer to 50 percent."" But Sainsbury ""is not planning to start a price war,"" a spokeswoman for the company said, adding that ""we are already very competitive."" Market leader Tesco ""continues to offer unbeatable value,"" the campaign which it launched in September 1996, a Tesco spokesman said. Analysts said the big four supermarkets, which also include Safeway and ASDA, were unlikely to want to risk the damage to margins which cutting prices would entail. ""A price war remains on the horizon rather than imminent,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named. Sainsbury is struggling to gain the initiative snatched by arch-rival Tesco which leapt into the market lead just over a year ago and is seeing sales growth of 7.5 percent. Sainsbury's sales were up 4.4 percent over the key Christmas trading period, an improvement over three percent gains seen in October 1996 but still not enough to threaten Tesco. Shares in the company, which is 40 percent owned by the Sainsbury family, fell 10 pence on Monday to trade at 331 pence after plunging more than 10 percent on Friday. Tesco saw its shares slip 5-1/2 to 354-1/2 pence while Safeway, the fourth largest store group, was down 12 pence at 377 pence and ASDA, which prides itself on being the cheapest of the big four, eased 1-1/2 to 120 pence. ""The market is right to mark shares down as a precaution...(but) no-one would ever dream"" of launching a full-scale price war, said Nick Bubb of Mees Pierson. British supermarkets generally obtain gross margins of 20-26 percent, analysts said, giving them flexibility to battle on price but with the leading four holding a majority of the market, there is little inclination to give up healthy profits. ""The supermarkets are in a state of relative equilibrium and Sainsbury is the last one to offer more margin at this stage,"" said the analyst. Tesco is in a stronger position ""and could be tempted to enforce that,"" he added, but suggested any move would fall short of a full price war where retailers might make hefty cuts on several thousand items, costing a couple of points on margins. ""Tesco might be tempted to stick the boot in, but...the more (it) forces Sainsbury into further problems, the more it would have to face retaliation,"" Bubb said. Analysts said supermarkets were more likely to push ahead with initiatives such as loyalty cards, improved customer services and marketing in order to increase sales and profits. ""I think at this stage a price war is unlikely, but if sales fall substantially for any of the big four, that situation could change,"" the analyst said. ($1=.6161 Pound) ","JoWinterbottom"
"British utility Northern Electric Plc made a last-ditch attempt Monday to remain independent by trying to overturn the extension of an offer by CE Electric that gives the U.S. company a majority of its shares. Britain's takeover panel was meeting Monday to consider an application by Northern and its advisers BZW to appeal the board's unusual decision to extend the bid. The panel extended the deadline on the 782 million British pound ($1.3 billion) bid from Dec. 20 until Dec. 24. The panel extended the fiercely fought bid on Friday in what newspaper reports said was a reaction to BZW's initial failure to disclose an extra 250,000 pound ($417,000) fee related to its performance in the bid. ""Following the investigation, the executive will consider what, if any, further action is appropriate,"" the panel said in a brief statement. The panel noted it may also look into the acquisition by BZW and investment bank Schroders of 2.32 percent of Northern Electric's shares last week. As the initial deadline expired, CE had obtained control of only 49.77 percent of Northern. But after the deadline was extended until Christmas Eve, CE notched that total up to 50.13 percent, a majority that would have given it victory. But acceptances after the initial deadline require consent from the Takeover Panel. Northern is now fighting to appeal the extension to try to make the late acceptances null and void and to retain its independence. ""If the panel rejects the right to appeal, or the appeal fails, then Northern will be taken over. If the appeal committee says the panel was wrong to extend the bid, then Northern stays independent,"" said one analyst who declined to be identified. At Northern's request, dealing in its shares was temporarily suspended from Monday morning, standing at 638 pence ($10.68), pending the conclusion of the appeal process. CE, which is 70 percent owned by Omaha-based CalEnergy, then complained to the panel last week about share purchases made by BZW and Schroders. The panel said there was nothing wrong with those share purchases but did rule out further buying by BZW and Schroders when it extended the deadline. A BZW official told Reuters that the fee from Northern was not in any way linked to BZW buying of Northern shares. Northern had fought hard to fend off CE Electric's 650 pence ($10.88) per share bid, which it claimed undervalued the company, promising a 17 percent rise in its final dividend and lower than expected debt. CE Electric, which raised its original 630 pence ($10.55) offer on Dec. 6, maintained that it was offering a fair price and has already bought nearly 30 percent of Northern on the market. It has said it will hang on to that stake even if its bid fails, which analysts said could depress Northern's shares. The bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds ($933 million) fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year. ","JoWinterbottom"
"Ordinarily seated at the rear of a courtroom, behind deep ranks of dark-suited corporate lawyers fighting anti-cigarette lawsuits, is the mystified legal defender of Dosal Tobacco Co. ""What am I doing here?"" Jose Martinez often asks as he fidgets through yet another courtroom hearing in one of the high-profile tobacco cases heading for trial. Martinez, of the Miami law firm Martinez, Gutierrez &amp; DeCordoba, puts that question to judges and to plaintiff attorneys pressing lawsuits on behalf of sick smokers, non-smokers claiming injuries from other people's cigarette fumes and the State of Florida, which is seeking tobacco money for Medicaid costs. ""We're just a small manufacturer, a family operation. We shouldn't be here,"" Martinez insists to anyone who will listen. Dosal -- now swept up in one of the great legal battles of the century -- is a tiny family-owned company based in Opa-Locka, a poor city north of Miami built by a real estate developer with a fanciful taste for Moorish architecture. It makes but a few million cigarettes a year -- compared with Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the largest cigarette maker in the world, which last year shipped nearly 231 billion cigarettes in the United States alone. Still, Dosal's name appears in three anti-tobacco lawsuits in Florida and another in Michigan, along with deep-pocketed giants such as RJR Nabisco Holdings and Philip Morris, which last year had more than $35 billion in tobacco sales. Dosal's main customer is the Florida prison system, which sells Dosal's DTC brand cigarettes in regular and king-sized lengths to the smokers among the state's 50,000 inmates. Even so, Dosal is named in the state's lawsuit against tobacco companies. Dosal also makes a brand or two favored by elderly Cuban emigres in south Florida, including Competidora. ""They buy bulk tobacco and make cigarettes on machines in Opa-Locka. It's a very small operation,"" Martinez said. ""And the customers for the Cuban brands are old and dying."" Good-humored and joking much of the time, Martinez is deadly serious about eliminating the legal threat to Dosal. In addition to filing formal requests that Dosal be dropped, he presses plaintiff lawyers informally with arguments on the futility of suing a company with limited financial resources. ""I ask every day,"" Martinez says. If kept in the lawsuits, including the so-called Broin class-action suit scheduled to go to trial Monday in Miami, Dosal could be made to pay a share of any monetrary judgment. The lawyers pressing the Broin case intend to ask for $5 billion or more in damages. And while the tobacco industry has yet to pay out a dollar in court damages after four decades of litigation, leaks in the industry's defenses are widely seen on Wall Street and elsewhere. The Broin case, being brought on behalf of an estimated 60,000 ailing and non-smoking flight attendants by lawyers Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt, is the first of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits coming to trial this year against U.S. cigarette makers. ""It's their fault,"" Martinez said, pointing to the Rosenblatts during a courtroom interview this week after a hearing in the Broin case, filed more than six years ago. ""All the other suits copied theirs."" Martinez said the Rosenblatts, who have named 10 defendants in the Broin lawsuit, were also responsible for the Michigan anti-tobacco lawsuit which has targeted Dosal and other cigarette makers. ""I don't think we have even sold any cigarettes in Michigan,"" Martinez said. ( ","MichaelConnor"
"Leading British television companies BSkyB, Carlton Communications and Granada Group teamed up on Friday to apply to run digital terrestrial TV (DTT) services in Britain. The formation of their British Digital Broadcasting venture, appeared to transform the prospects for DTT, previously dismissed as a ""lame duck"" technology. British Digital Broadcasting has put in an application to run three DTT licences, offering 15 channels, including subscription channels from the BBC. It faces competition from U.S. owned cable company International CableTel Inc, which has also put in an application for three of the four available networks. The company is Britain's third largest cable operator and owns NTL, one of two major British transmission companies. The BSkyB/Carlton/Granada/BBC venture plans three premium subscription channels showing top films and sporting action. Another 12 channels will be offered as part of a basic subscription package. Shares in the three companies surged on Friday as markets welcomed the news. BSkyB added 21.5p to 602p, Carlton gained 21p to 540.5p and Granada added 12.5p to 890p. DTT will broadcast from land-based transmitters to ordinary rooftop aerials. However, viewers will need a set-top decoder costing at least 200 pounds ($324) to receive the service. There will be six digital networks or ""multiplexes"", each capable of broadcasting at least five channels. The first two have been earmarked for the existing, free, terrestrial broadcasters, the BBC and the ITV commercial network. The other four will be awarded by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) watchdog body. The service is expected to be on the air by mid-1998. Digital television offers more channels, clearer pictures and the possibility of accessing interactive services such as home shopping and home banking. But DTT, with only 30 channels, had been seen as the poor relation to BSkyB's planned satellite version which will offer 200 channels. BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, is expected to press on with its digital satellite launch in Britain later this year. DTT is seen as a complementary service. ""By plugging in one simple set top box, viewers will be able to see all the existing terrestrial channels, new free channels, the latest movies and the best sport,"" said Carlton chairman Michael Green. Green will chair British Digital Broadcasting, and Carlton, Granada and BSkyB will each own one third of the company which unites Britain's leading commercial ITV companies with satellite pay operator BSkyB. If successful in winning the three licences, the shareholders have agreed to meet between them a peak funding requirement of up to 300 million pounds. The company is expected to be profitable within five years. ($1=.6172 Pound) ","KeithWeir"
"China will aim to show U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that improving Sino-American ties will not be harmed by the death of Deng Xiaoping, analysts said on Sunday. They also said Albright, who arrives in China on Monday for a brief stopover on her nine-nation tour, would likely focus on maintaining momentum in the once-stalled ties, looking ahead to exchanges of senior level visits. ""China will want to make the point that it is stable after Deng's death,"" said Niu Jun, a specialist in U.S. policy issues at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank. ""It will want to demonstrate that there is no change in Sino-U.S. relations,"" he said. Deng, architect of sweeping economic reforms that have embraced capitalist-style economic policies, died on Wednesday aged 92. Albright will arrive in Beijing during a six-day mourning period for the nation's paramount leader and one day before the funeral. Chinese leaders have been eager to show that affairs of state will continue as usual. Deng's hand-picked successor, President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, has vowed to push ahead with Deng's programme and even outdo him. Jiang has been in power since he was propelled to the top party post in 1989, when Deng abandoned his old ally Zhao Ziyang in a dispute over the use of force against students pushing for But Jiang now must fend off other contenders for power without the helping hand of his benefactor. Albright, on her first trip overseas since becoming America's top diplomat last month, will meet Jiang as well as Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. Western analysts said Albright would not shrink from contentious issues like China's human rights record, but would chart a steady course in the vital Sino-U.S. relationship during President Bill Clinton's second term. ""The U.S. wants to ensure that its China relations are no longer scraping along the bottom,"" said a Western diplomat. U.S.-China ties had stumbled badly over a range of issues including Taiwan, trade, arms proliferation and human rights. A long-delayed visit to Beijing in November by Albright's predecessor Warren Christopher paved the way for the renewed push to put differences aside. That new approach was endorsed at a meeting between Jiang and Clinton at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila later that month. U.S. Vice President Al Gore will travel to China next month and Clinton and Jiang are expected to exchange visits over the next year. Albright may be compelled to touch on human rights during her talks with Chinese officials as the United States plans to co-sponsor a resolution critical of China at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Washington may also be looking to show at least some measure of toughness towards Beijing to allay domestic concerns following allegations of Chinese contributions to Clinton's re-election campaign. But Albright and other U.S. officials have said no one issue should dominate the relationship. Analysts said that probably means that as for the more difficult problems, the two sides will have to agree to disagree. ","WilliamKazer"
"Hong Kong's hefty cash reserves offer a comfortable cushion for children born in 1997, the year the British colony returns to Chinese sovereignty. According to Wednesday's 1997/98 budget figures, thrifty Hong Kong will confront its future as part of China with HK$330 billion (US$42 billion) in total fiscal reserves. That works out to more than US$6,500 for each man, woman and child in the territory. By comparison, gross national debt in the United States of US$5.5 trillion translates into a debt of US$20,500 for every child born there this year. But Financial Secretary Donald Tsang resisted the temptation to hand down a give-away budget. Instead of widely-anticipated tax cuts, Tsang's budget speech for 1997/98 (April-March) stressed the need for continuity in 1997, and Hong Kong's ability to work with China to strike a balance. ""Fortunately, our healthy public finances and robust economic prospects have made the task of finding the right balance somewhat easier,"" Tsang said. But critics were not satisfied by the government's failure to spend more on the needy, particularly the elderly, while reporting a budget surplus of HK$15.1 billion this year rising to HK$31.7 billion in 1997/98. ""I think the size of the surplus is utterly obscene and I'm very, very mad just on that,"" said Emily Lau, an independent Democrat and outspoken critic of the government's social policy. ""We are probably the richest place on earth and to think we have several hundred thousand poeple living from hand to mouth. ""I've got nothing against the tax reduction on wine, that's fine. But I think we should also do something for the elderly."" Tsang cut duties on wine to 60 percent from 90 percent. Experts warned that the gap between rich and poor in Hong Kong is bound to widen as impoverished Chinese immigrants flock to Hong Kong seeking streets paved with gold. In 1995, Hong Kong increased the quota for mainland immigrants to 150 a day from 105, mainly for family reunions. ""Twenty years ago, Hong Kong could absorb impoverished migrants from the mainland in large numbers because it had an immense need for cheap labour,"" said David Dodwell, a director at Jardine Fleming Holdings. ""Today, that is no longer the case. Now our capacity to absorb those in the economy today is much less than it used to be. We don't have the unskilled jobs,"" he said. Hong Kong's rapid transformation from international manufacturing and industrial hub into a services economy geared to China's economic expansion has caused the relocation of virtually its entire manufacturing base into southern China. Tsang's highly conservative budget indicated growing awareness of the potential ramifications of mainland immigration, with a 150-percent boost to spending on benefits for newly-arrived mainland children. ""As for the children, we help them fit into our schools with special support services and remedial English programmes,"" he said. ""In 1997/98 we will spend a total of around HK$168 million on these children -- an increase of over 150 percent in real terms of 1996/97."" ($ = 7.74 HK dollars) ","SarahDavison"
"China and South Korea negotiated on Friday over the defection of a top North Korean who has taken refuge in Seoul's mission in Beijing while Pyongyang officials said they aimed to persuade the defector to return. Talks in Singapore between South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen failed to break a deadlock over the defector, Hwang Jang-yop, 73, the most senior Pyongyang official to flee the North. In Beijing, however, a South Korean embassy official said negotiations had begun over Hwang, who spent a second night in the embassy compound with an aide as Seoul and Pyongyang both made hectic efforts to claim him. China has been dragged unwillingly into the row between an old communist comrade and a new business friend. Diplomats have said China may find itself with little option but to give in to the wishes of the defector, thus angering one of its last remaining socialist allies. Beijing tried to play for time. ""This incident happened all of a sudden, so we need more time to investigate,"" China's Qian told reporters after a 50-minute meeting with Seoul's Yoo in Singapore. He urged both Koreas ""to treat this matter with a cool and calm manner, to keep peace and stability"". Yoo said the two sides would meet again, but did not say where or when. He said Friday's talks were ""good"". In the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, dozens of Chinese police cordoned Seoul's consular section off for a second day. Hwang arrived at its door on Wednesday to seek asylum. ""They (North Koreans) are harassing us and we are a little nervous about that,"" said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik, adding that Seoul had asked Beijing to maintain tight security around the compound. Hwang, who could face summary execution or a lifetime in the gulag if he goes back to the North, was in good health and sleeping well, Chang said. He was spending the day reading. A North Korean official standing outside the police cordon said Pyongyang had no plans to storm the compound to recover a countryman Pyongyang says was kidnapped. ""We are waiting here for him to come out and then ask him to come back,"" said the official who declined to identify himself. A group of about 10 North Koreans, badges of the late North Korean leader Kim Il-sung pinned to their lapels, returned to wait in freezing temperatures outside the compound on Friday after police asked them to leave overnight. ""If China allows him to go to South Korea then we will be disappointed,"" said another North Korean. ""It will be regrettable."" Some commentators have suggested Pyongyang might react violently to the defection of a man ranked 24 in its hierarchy, who is a senior aide to reclusive leader Kim Jong-il and North Korea's top communist party theoretician. Pyongyang has charged that Hwang must have been kidnapped, and has called on Beijing to sort out the mess. Seoul has dismissed as ""preposterous"" Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, was abducted. It was not clear whether Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korea's Foreign Minister, was meeting Chinese officials. Kim failed to hold talks with Chinese officials when he arrived on Thursday as Beijing, apparently angered by Seoul's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China, avoided a meeting, South Korean sources said. Officials at the North Korean embassy refused to comment or confirm reports from Seoul that Pyongyang had sent a delegation to China to discuss Hwang's defection. ","BenjaminKangLim"
"Quaker Oats Co. conceded defeat Thursday in its effort to turn around its struggling Snapple beverage unit and agreed to sell it for $300 million -- $1.4 billion less than it paid for the business -- to Triarc Cos. Inc., the owner of rival Mistic beverages. The selling price -- far below the $1.7 billion Quaker paid for the premium beverage company in 1994 -- disappointed Wall Street, but analysts said they were pleased that Quaker did the deal. ""It was a fire sale price ... The bad news is the investment has been a disaster, the good news is they're trying to put it behind them,"" said John McMillin, a food industry analyst at Prudential Securities, a brokerage and investment bank. Snapple's ready-to-drink teas and juices virtually invented the premium soft drink market and remain a leader, with more than $500 million in 1996 sales. But Snapple has lost money ever since Chicago-based Quaker -- better known for its breakfast cereals and Gatorade sports drinks -- bought it. Snapple sales fell 8 percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, the company reported last month. ""The decision to sell Snapple was reached after an extensive review of various shareholder value-building options by management,"" said Quaker Chairman William Smithburg in a statement. ""After reviewing all possible options, we decided it was in the shareholders' interest to remove the financial burdens and risks Snapple brought to the portfolio and better focus on our value-driving businesses,"" Smithburg said. New York-based Triarc, the buyer, owns the Mistic drinks business, a Snapple rival. It also owns Royal Crown soft drinks, Arby's Inc. fast-food restaurants and other businesses. ""With respect to Triarc, this transaction is very positive ... it is complementary to Triarc's existing position in Mistic, which is fruit juices, while Snapple is mostly teas,"" said Michael Branca, a food industry analyst at Lehman Brothers, a brokerage and investment bank. ""In addition, Triarc's beverage management is highly respected in the beverage distribution business ... Snapple could well be reborn under Triarc,"" Branca said. Triarc Beverage Group Chief Executive Michael Weinstein said his company plans to apply similar marketing principles to Snapple that it used to turn around the Mistic line. Triarc will consult distributors and review the consumer research on Snapple, and ""Then we're going to move like hell to do some really cool, innovative things in packaging and product and advertising to try to build the brand back up again,"" Weinstein said. Triarc bought the Mistic juices line from a sole proprietor for $95 million in August 1995. It had sales of about $130 million in 1996. ""We have a track record in this category with Mistic, of taking a brand that was slumping and applying some basic principles ... to it. We know how to make a brand succeed. We're more entrepreneurial,"" Weinstein said. Quaker's stock rose  25 cents to $37.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Triarc rose $1.625 to $17.375. Quaker said it would take a non-cash pretax charge of about $1.4 billion, or $8.40 a share, in its first quarter, to record the loss on the sale. The company also said it would be able to recoup about $250 million in taxes paid on previous capital gains, ""making the cash value of the transaction approximately $550 million."" A Quaker spokesman said the tax consideration was a key part of the company's decision to sell Snapple to Triarc now. The spokesman added that Triarc had indicated it intends to transfer virtually all Snapple employees with the business. Triarc said it expected to close the deal by the end of June, subject to customary conditions, including government antitrust clearance. Besides Snapple, Quaker's other products include Gatorade, which continues to dominate the sports drink market, and cereals, such as Quaker oatmeals, Cap'n Crunch and Life. ""Quaker still has the crown jewels -- Gatorade and the cereals -- and performance in those businesses has been pretty good,"" said food industry analyst George Staphos of the investment bank and brokerage of PaineWebber. ""The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back,"" said John O'Neil, food industry analyst at BT Securities. ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa on Wednesday launched plans to turn back the clock and curb demonstrations and foreign funding for political parties after the territory is handed back to China this year. The planned changes, though controversial, were expected after China's parliament, or National People's Congress, resolved in late February that a string of existing Hong Kong laws protecting civil liberties and rights should be changed. China's decision, based on the argument that existing laws breach Hong Kong's post-handover constitution, takes effect on July 1, when the British colony of 156 years reverts to China. It will also remove at a stroke democratic freedoms introduced during the office of British Governor Chris Patten, whom China considers an arch-foe. Top civil servant Michael Suen, who has been seconded to Tung's office to help craft the post-handover government, said the changes, outlined in a consultation paper released to the media, were needed because of China's decision. The NPC took the action because China views the political liberalisation of Hong Kong in the twilight years of British rule as a breach of its handover agreements with Britain. ""The reason for this whole exercise is because of the legal vacuum caused by the NPC...so we are inviting public comments on the proposals,"" Suen, secretary for policy coordination, told a news conference. Under the plans, societies and political parties would have to be registered and might be refused registration if they are known to have ties to or receive donations from foreign political organisations or individuals. People wishing to hold demonstrations would have to get permission from police seven days in advance. Demonstrations should only be staged after the police issue a notice of ""no objection"". Under the current system, the police need only be notified beforehand. Suen said the proposals complied with Hong Kong's Basic Law, the post-handover constitution, and were above world standards. ""In working out the proposals, we adhere to the principle that they must be in full compliance with the Basic Law and consistent with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,"" Suen said. Echoing the well-worn words of his boss, Tung Chee-hwa, Suen also said the changes were necessary to strike a balance between civil liberties and social order. ""We must strike a balance between civil liberties and social stability, personal rights and social obligations, individual interests and the common good,"" Suen said. ""Within the generality of this commitment, we seek to establish broad consensus among the people of Hong Kong as to where the balance should lie."" The public was invited to give comments on the plans in a pulse-taking exercise over the next three weeks, Suen said. Legislation drafted on the basis of the proposals will be enacted by a controversial China-anointed provisional legislature which replaces the elected Legislative Council on July 1. The departing colonial power Britain, some of its allies and Hong Kong democracy groups have attacked all the moves as a reversal of democratic freedoms in this territory of 6.4 million people. Under the Sino-British agreements on the handover, Hong Kong has been guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. ","TanEeLyn"
"A senior Clinton administration adviser said Friday electronic commerce over the Internet could become the world's largest trade category within the next decade if it did not become over-regulated. Ira Magaziner, senior advisor to President Clinton for policy development, said in a keynote speech to an Internet Tax Policy Conference here the Internet must remain a free market for electronic commerce to take off. ""If we get the right kind of environment in place, we can accelerate this growth so that in a five- to 10-year time frame, trade across the Internet will actually be more than any other category of trade,"" he said. ""If we do it wrong, we could spend 30 to 40 years trying to undo bad policy."" The Clinton administration last month proposed a global electronic commerce framework and put forth a draft policy which proposes making cyberspace a duty-free zone, with no new taxes and minimal governmental regulation. ""One of the reasons we wanted to move quickly is we wanted to pre-empt what we saw as bad policy already being thought about,"" said Magaziner, who said he knows of a dozen countries contemplating slapping duties on the Internet. Magaziner, who organized the task force on health care which failed in its bid to introduce sweeping health care reforms in Clinton's first presidenctial term, said the White House wanted to be ""completely open"" in its developing its initiative. The draft document is posted on the Internet at the White House home page (http://whitehouse.gov). The administration is collecting responses and hopes to issue a final version of the policy paper in March, the Clinton adviser said. Magaziner said intellectual property protection was a key issue, along with fair use, liability and privacy, and he said the government's policy towards encryption, which has been sharply criticized here in Silicon Valley, is still evolving. ""We want to preserve the Internet in its somewhat anarchic form...,"" he said of the White House position. ""The economic potential is tremendous, and what we in government must do is make sure we don't mess it up or interfere."" ","SamuelPerry"
"The battle for UK digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences is a David and Goliath contest pitting three of the country's biggest broadcasting groups against a little known cable company. DTN, owned by Nasdaq-listed International CableTel, finds itself up against the might of pay television giant British Sky Broadcasting and ITV companies Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc. But International CableTel chief executive Barclay Knapp has not yet raised the white flag as Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) considers the two bids. ""We are presenting ourselves as the ones that win on the merits,"" Knapp said in an interview on Wednesday. ""We are going to create an environment for new British programming to proliferate and to very aggressively exploit the interactive services component,"" he added. Knapp believes that the successful launch of DTT is the best way to challenge BSkyB's dominance of UK pay television. He also maintains that major programme makers and suppliers should not be left to run broadcast networks. DTT signals are broadcast from land-based transmitters to ordinary aerials but viewers need a set-top box or decoder to view what is broadcast. Digital compression improves sound and picture quality and means that more than 30 channels can be picked up. The technology permits a link to interactive services. DTN and the rival British Digital Broadcasting consortium are each bidding for the same three blocks of frequencies, capable of carrying some 18 channels. The ITC decision on the award of the licences is expected around May and DTT would begin in the spring or summer of 1998. BSkyB plans separately to launch digital satellite services with up to 200 channels into the UK late this year and DTN questions its commitment to making the terrestrial version work. International CableTel, the company behind DTN, has almost all its operations in the UK, where it is the third largest cable operator and also owns the NTL transmission network. It believes its skills in programme packaging and marketing make it the ideal candidate to run DTT frequencies. Knapp points to International Cabletel's success in securing take up of around 40 percent in some of its cable franchise areas. ""Sports and movies are good for the first 20 percent in take-up but the two remaining factors are the breadth of choice and pricing,"" he said. International CableTel breaks its programme packages down into tiers such as news or natural history to bring on board those not tempted by soccer or Hollywood blockbusters. He believes that customers could be offered a limited package of say five extra DTT channels for around six pounds per month to get them to sample the multi-channel future. ""People don't want to dive right in, they just want to get their feet wet,"" he said. ","KeithWeir"
"Intel Corp. stock fell for the third straight day Friday on concerns that a series of upcoming price cuts could slow the company's momentum. The stock tumbled $6.75 to $130.50, off a total of $16.125, or roughly 11 percent, since Tuesday. The fall led the entire market lower, and analysts cited nervousness about Intel's first-quarter results, due after the market close on Monday. The earnings report will serve as a critical barometer of whether strong corporate earnings can keep underpinning stock values. Industry analysts said Intel's quarterly price cuts on Pentium processors are expected to lead to slightly lower prices for personal computers. Some speculated that in expectation of rival chips, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s new K6, Intel will cut Pentium prices more than usual, from 25 percent to 30 percent. ""This continues to fuel normal PC demand,"" said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest Inc in San Jose, Calif. ""This is the normal stuff that keeps stimulating the market."" According to First Call, which tracks Wall Street estimates, analysts expect Intel to report a first-quarter profit of $2.07 a share, up from $1.02 a year ago, when Intel posted net income of $894 million on revenues of $4.64 billion. If Intel meets those expectations, it will be the second straight quarter in which the world's largest maker of computer chips has more than doubled its year-on-year profits. An Intel spokesman said the company could not comment this close to its earnings report, but the company said in mid-March -- within two weeks of the close of the quarter -- that market fundamentals ""remain very strong."" Intel executives told analysts in January they expect revenues to be around $6.4 billion, about even with what it reported in the fourth quarter. Gross margins -- the difference between revenue and the costs of goods -- are expected to be even with or below the fourth quarter's 63 percent. Analysts said Intel's bellwether role -- it has recently made a habit of re-energising flagging stock markets with particularly upbeat earnings reports -- is especially crucial given Wall Street's current moodiness. Wall Street is particularly wary of the outlook for corporate earnings following the Federal Reserve's March 25 decision to raise interest rates and fresh speculation about chances of another rate increase based on Friday's report of underlying price pressures at the wholesale level in March. ""People are scared. Intel is one of the biggest holdings and they can still sell it at a profit,"" said David Wu, high-tech analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. ""They're scared because tech stocks are going down. If technology stocks can't do corporate earnings, you can forget about the rest. Analysts said the much-heralded ""whisper"" number for Intel is for it to make $2.15 a share, and that even $2.20 a share could be possible given another blow-out quarter. But, one analyst cautioned, ""anything less than $2.15 would not be good"" for the market. Market researcher Dataquest said last week that Intel will continue to dominate the personal computer industry, where its processors currently account for 95 percent of the market, although clone-makers will start to make inroads this year. Intel spokesman Howard High said Friday the company will continue with its routine quarterly pricing changes, but that he saw no unusual changes in the upcoming pricing pattern from that to which the PC industry has grown accustomed. ""We do our price declines in a pretty predictable, orderly fashion,"" he said. Analysts expect Intel to cut some prices when it unveils its new high-end Pentium II chip next month, and High said Intel's practice is to ""move other products down a notch"" to make room for the new processors. ""The movement is always in a relatively consistent direction, which is down. The rate is dependent on market conditions ... They (the pricing reductions) seem to have been pretty constant over the years,"" he added. In February, Intel's pricing changes for its Pentium and Pentium Pro family of microprocessors ranged from no change at all to roughly a 34 percent decline, he noted. Intel's processors range in price from around $100 for the lower-end, older models to over $1,000 for the highest-end chips. ","SamuelPerry"
"Fresh from a Supreme Court victory, Florida's anti-tobacco activists were bracing for a legislative assault on the innovative law allowing the state to sue cigarette makers. Although bloodied by past failures to repeal the 1994 law, which undoes many of the tobacco industry's best legal defences, opponents said Tuesday the campaign to repeal Florida's third-party medical liability act would continue through the current legislative session scheduled to last until May. ""The fight goes on,"" said Jodi Chase, general counsel for Associated Industries of Florida Inc., a business group prominent in the repeal campaign. Bills to repeal the medical-liability law have been introduced in both houses of the Florida legislature. A repeal bill was vetoed by Gov. Lawton Chiles two years ago and an effort to override his veto failed in 1996. On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to take up a tobacco industry challenge to the constitutionality of the law but did not deal with the crux of the challenge and left open the possibility of considering the matter after a trial. Lawyers for both Florida and cigarette makers said the Supreme Court action makes it even more likely a trial in a billion-dollar lawsuit against the tobacco industry will go ahead as scheduled on August 4 in West Palm Beach, Fla. ""The arena now will be the Florida legislature,"" said Harold Lewis, chief inspector general for Chiles. Lewis said the governor and allies inside and outside state government expected tobacco companies and others pushing repeal to launch a full-press media and lobbying offensive, even though some top legislators have said a vote on repeal bills was unlikely this year. A spokesman for Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the world's biggest cigarette maker and one of the defendants in the West Palm Beach case, said the company rarely discusses its lobbying efforts but that lawyers were preparing for trial. Lewis said 60 or more lobbyists were working against the bill and that he expected millions of dollars to be spent on the effort. A group working with Chiles, the Coalition to Clear the Air for Florida Taxpayers, is preparing a media and organising campaign to support the law, according to executive director Beth Labasky. The group, composed of health organisations and school groups, is calling its campaign, ""Tobacco: Florida's Public Enemy Number One"", and expects to spend under $1 million on advertising, consultant Ron Sachs said. Smith Barney tobacco industry analyst Martin Feldman said a constitutional challenge to the Florida law was highly likely to be heard by the Supreme Court if cigarette makers lose in the West Palm Beach trial. ""The Supreme has specifically provided the option of considering the industry's claim at a date in the future, and quite possibly as part of an appeal -- should that prove necessary,"" Feldman said in a report.

Gamble said the NSW state government had told him they would be making their decision in the first quarter of 1997. ","KevinMorrison"
"China's decision to resume corn exports could pressure the United States and other producers into discounting their grain to remain competitive on the world market, traders and grain industry sources said on Thursday. ""We will see a price war,"" a U.S. trader said. ""People are already discounting U.S. replacement by US$3-$4 a tonne."" China, once one of the world's biggest corn exporters, banned overseas sales of the grain in December 1994 to help re-build dwindling central stocks.   Total sales of Chinese corn this month to Southeast Asia could hit 300,000 tonnes by the end of this week, traders said. The market was unsure about how to read the sales. Some traders said they did not necessarily signal a full lifting of the export ban, while others said they could be the start of a flood of Chinese corn onto the world market. Some traders said Chinese sales this year could hit one million tonnes. Already in the past week, at least 76,000 tonnes have been confirmed sold to South Korea, for April/May arrival at between $139.50 and $143 a tonne, inclusive of cost and freight (C&amp;F).   ""They've already done 150,000 (tonnes) to South Korea and Malaysia, so there's 300,000 tonnes right there, and from there they could do a bit more,"" another trader said. China's corn crop harvested in late 1996 has been estimated by Western and Japanese grain traders at 110-118 million tonnes. A good proportion of the harvest went into central reserves because the government was offering farmers above the market price for the quota they must sell to the state, a trader said. With farmers getting more than 1,000 yuan ($120) a tonne from the grain bureaux, ""they delivered to the government everything they could,"" he said.   Emerging competition had pushed the Chinese price down to $129 a tonne C&amp;F for May arrival by Thursday afternoon, as trader Toepfer secured two 52,500-tonne shipments in a Korean Feed Association tender. U.S. trader Cargill sold one cargo of 52,500 tonnes of corn in the same tender with a seller's option for Chinese corn at $140.10 for March 30 arrival. Traders representing China's central food trading arm will travel to Manila on Thursday to hammer out the final details of a government-to-government deal to sell 145,000 tonnes of Chinese corn to the Philippines, said a trading source who expected the deal to be quickly finalised.   ""So now the silos are choc-a-bloc and the treasury is empty in terms of grain procurement,"" he said. ""Exports will be an attempt to re-balance the books and stem the negative market feelings."" The current Chinese market price for corn is about 800 yuan a tonne, while corn is being offered for export at the northeastern port of Dalian for 1,040 yuan a tonne FOB (free on board). Whether the government now gives the green light to exports depends on how comfortable the authorities are about the domestic supply/demand situation, traders said.   Around 1.5 million tonnes of corn is being moved from northern growing areas to the south, to relieve pressure on storage facilities, traders said. And according to one well-connected trading source, 200,000 tonnes is being sold to a number of Central Asian countries that suffered poor 1996 corn crops. This could not be confirmed. U.S. corn is arriving in Southeast Asia at $152-$153 a tonne, a Singapore source said. April arrival is priced around $141-$142 a tonne C&amp;F. Argentine corn, available from late April, is already being discounted, another source said.   ""It's cheap for summer, $134-$135 C&amp;F,"" he said, against $135-$136 two weeks ago. Sales have been reported in Thailand as low as $130 C&amp;F. The question for traders was, would the Chinese sellers push their prices down to that level, thereby forcing the U.S., which had considered the market its own, to discount further. ""They (U.S. exporters) will have to price themselves lower,"" another trader said. ""It is tight, but not so tight that they can't afford to maintain their export programme.""   Evidence of Chinese corn sales weighed on Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn futures on Wednesday, with March closing down 1/2-cent at $2.70-1/2 per bushel. China has the freight advantage in the region, especially with the growing number of ports able to take large Panamax-sized vessels (up to 65,000 dwt), another source said. A Japanese trader said freight to Japan could tip the balance in favour of Chinese corn if the export programme did kick off.   ""Japan could be interested in Chinese corn, it depends on price,"" the trader said by telephone from Beijing. ""Even if it is a little higher than CBOT, we can ship directly to Japanese local ports and save on the freight."" ","LynneO'Donnell"
"The Czech National Bank (CNB) said on Wednesday that it was not satisfied with the continued firming of the Czech crown, and cautioned that it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary. ""Intervention (on the market) is our normal instrument, and we can use it whenever we are not satisfied (with the crown's exchange rate),"" CNB spokesman Martin Svehla told Reuters. The crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket on Wednesday, as the CNB matched the market, fixing it at 27.947/dollar 16.664/mark, or 5.42 percent over parity with the basket, and just below Tuesday's record fixing at +5.51. ""The other question is whether we are satisfied? You heard (CNB) governor (Josef Tosovsky) saying there is 'no reason' for the crown to be like this,"" Svehla added. ""It signals that the central bank is not fully satisfied with this development."" He declined to elaborate, and said these were just ""general"" comments. The crown's surge has been fuelled by more than 30 billion crowns in recent issues of mostly medium-term Eurobonds. Tosovsky said at the peak of the wave in late January that there was ""no rational"" macroeconomic reason for the crown's rise, and the Eurobond wave. The firming currency is compounding a troublesome trade deficit which grew to a record 160 billion crowns in 1996. Some crown dealers have said the central bank that had been putting out feelers in the market recently, but others said that it did not appear that intervention was imminent. ""I don't expect any direct intervention soon,"" said Citibank dealer Emil Stava. ""I don't think their main goal is to help exporters by a depreciation of the currency."" He said the CNB was still mainly concerned with controlling the money supply and inflation. The market has not bought the CNB's comments, as dealers keep buying crowns. Crown Eurobonds keep coming -- another billion crowns was issued on Wednesday -- taking advantage of interest rate spreads against major currencies and an inverted yield curve. The CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent. Svehla repeated that the CNB had no immediate plans to lower its key interest rates, despite a rapid decline in the money supply in recent months. The CNB's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent, while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June. Meanwhile inflation in January slowed to 7.4 percent, year-on-year, from 8.6 percent in December. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JohnMastrini"
"Netscape Communications Corp. on Wednesday raised the ante in the Internet software wars, announcing a price increase effective April 1 as it prepares to release new products this spring. Netscape also introduced a five-level support program, beginning next month, which allows customers to pick the level of service they are willing to pay for. The price of Communicator, the integrated communications package which includes Netscape's Navigator browser, will rise to $59 from $49, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company said. Its enterprise server software, used on the server computers that run networks, will cost $1,295, up from $995. Under the new pricing, Netscape will charge an average 10 percent to 15 percent more for service, it said. But, by delaying the price increases until April 1, Netscape has made a pre-release version of Communicator a more attractive buy and positioned itself for higher sales this quarter, executives said. People who pay now for the software, which is available in a preview version, will be able to get the final version for free when it becomes available in the next quarter. Michael Homer, Netscape's vice president of marketing, said the new prices still offer a better deal than rival products from Microsoft Corp. and the Lotus Development Corp. unit of International Business Machines Corp.. Lotus President Jeff Papows quickly challenged that and accused Netscape executives of ""childish behavior"" in making pricing comparisons that Papows said were misleading. ""There's very little difference in the price points, actually,"" Papows said after making a presentation to a Goldman Sachs conference at which Netscape's vice president of engineering, Eric Hahn, disclosed the price increases. ""Our servers are much cheaper to acquire,"" he said, noting that Lotus Domino server software is priced at $2,995 compared with Netscape's SuiteSpot 3.0, which allows customers to chose five of its nine server products for $3,995, or $4,995 after April 1. A Microsoft executive also disputed Netscape's pricing claim. ""Our browser and our server are still free, so we've got to be less expensive,"" said Mike Nash, a marketing director in the company's personal and business systems group. Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser is free for all platforms, and its Internet Information Service is included as a feature of the Windows NT Server operating systems for large networks. The three companies are competing fiercely in the fast-growing market for electronic mail, scheduling and so-called workgroup software for intranets, the corporate networks that make use of cost-effective Internet technologies. Netscape stock rose 87.5 cents to $35.625, and Microsoft climbed $1.375 to $99.875, both on the Nasdaq market. IBM rose 12.5 cents to $144.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. Homer said a configuration for 1,000 users combining Communicator and Netscape's server software only costs $58 per user computer -- just $23 a user for those already using Navigator -- compared to $77 for Lotus. But Papows contested this, saying the true list price figure would be around $58, or roughly the same. ""They are quoting irrelevent data, doing it deliberately, and posting it to their Web site,"" he said, adding he recently discussed his concerns with Homer and Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale. The Lotus executive added, however, that he expects the market for all players to continue to expand briskly, with Lotus aiming to increase the number of electronic mail users of its software by up to 8.5 million this year to 18 million. ""We're doing enormously well. I suspect they're doing well, too. There's a big market,"" he said, adding Netscape ""ought to be well credited for invigorating the Internet market."" Homer said Netscape's price advantage was even greater, according to recent studies by third parties, when the total cost of acquiring, installing and using its systems was taken into account, including training and other factors.

"CSX Corp and Conrail Inc were expected Thursday to announce sweetened terms for their proposed friendly $8.5 billion merger, according to sources familiar with the transaction. The new terms were expected to include a richer exchange ratio in the stock portion of the cash and stock transaction and a speedier payment to investors by setting up a voting trust for all shares, the sources said. Conrail and CSX have been discussing a sweetened deal for weeks in an attempt to appease shareholders who favour Norfolk Southern Corp's $10 billion all-cash bid for Conrail. Specific details of the new terms were not immediately available. The CSX board reportedly met on Wednesday night to discuss the new terms. A spokesman for CSX declined to comment. Conrail could not be reached for comment. Early on Wednesday evening, a source close to the talks said the two companies were on the verge of reaching new terms. ""It's very close,"" said the source who did not want to be identified, adding the boards were pursuing revisions that would give shareholders ""more value and quicker payment"". Upon announcing new terms for the controversial transaction, Conrail is expected to cancel a December 23 meeting in which shareholders were set to vote on a key provision of the deal. CSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail for $110 per share in a cash tender offer and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent in a second cash tender offer. CSX plans to buy the remaining 60 percent of Conrail shares in stock at an exchange ratio of 1.85619 CSX shares for each Conrail share. Norfolk Southern has offered to buy Conrail for $110 per share in cash. Conrail has rejected the offer, contending that a transaction with CSX is a better fit. But the Conrail-CSX merger needs shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law in order for CSX to buy another 20.1 percent of Conrail. A U.S. judge on Tuesday ordered Conrail to conduct the December 23 meeting even though it contended that it could delay the vote if it didn't have enough shareholder support. Conrail would be permitted to delay the meeting if it revised the existing merger agreement. Shareholders have expressed concern that they would not receive payment for the stock portion of the transaction until the deal clears regulatory hurdles. The proposed merger of Conrail and CSX, first announced on October 15, would create an powerhouse railroad on the U.S. East Coast. But a revision of terms might not signal an end to the battle for Conrail. Industry experts have widely expected Norfolk Southern to quickly raise its bid if Conrail and CSC sweeten the terms of their proposal. A spokesman for Norfolk Southern declined to comment on whether it will be prepared to raise its offer, noting only ""we have said that, whatever they do, we will respond appropriately"".

"Kmart Corp. said Monday it may merge its Builders Square stores with Waban Inc.'s HomeBase business in a deal that would create the nation's third largest home improvement chain. The deal, which reflects consolidation in the highly competitive home improvement retail niche, would also complete Kmart's exit from specialty retailing. ""What this will do is complete (Kmart's) strategy of divesting non-core businesses,"" Michael Conn, Gruntal &amp; Co. retail analyst, said. Kmart said if a deal was completed, the Los Angeles-based investment group Leonard Green &amp; Partners L.P. would hold a majority interest in the new company. Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., and Waban, headquartered in Natick, Mass., would each retain minority interests. The proposed new company would have about 250 stores in 25 states with annual revenues of nearly $4 billion. ""We've been looking for the opportunity to combine Builders Square, a regional business, with another party...in a consolidating industry,"" Robert Burton, director of Kmart's investor relations, said. Builders Square's stores are largely in the Midwest and central United States. HomeBase has 84 stores in 10 Western states. ""It makes perfect sense,"" First of Michigan analyst Daniel Poole said of the combination. But he added that Home Depot, which operates retail stores for the do-it-yourself customer and home remodeler, still poses stiff competition for the new company that will be formed by combining Builders Square and HomeBase. Marvin Rich, Kmart's executive vice president of strategic planning, finance and administration, said the proposed transaction was part of his firm's plan for the disposition of Builders Square. He said Kmart intends to reclassify Builders Square as a ""discontinued operation"" in its year-end financial statements and record a net loss of $350 million to $400 million from discontinued operations. Burton said the combination of Builders Square and HomeBase could be completed in Kmart's fiscal first quarter, which ends in April. ""While we are in the preliminary stages of this transaction, all parties are interested in the potential opportunity that could come from combining these similar home improvement operations,"" Rich said. ""Clearly, there is opportunity here to create a large, financially liquid home improvement business which can be competitive on a national basis,"" Rich said. Waban, which operates BJ's Wholesale Clubs as well as the HomeBase chain, said that as a result of its talks with Kmart it was suspending plans to spin off the BJ's unit. ""This (Kmart) transaction has the potential to provide Waban and its shareholders greater value than our previously announced plan to separate our BJ's Wholesale Club and HomeBase divisions through a tax-free spin-off of BJ's,"" Waban President Herbert J. Zarkin said in a statement. He said that if a sale of HomeBase was concluded, the company would use the proceeds to retire corporate debt and for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock. Kmart previously shed its specialty retail concepts, selling off to the public several companies including Borders Group Inc, The Sports Authority Inc. and OfficeMax Inc. In 1994, Leonard Green &amp; Partners acquired PayLess Drug Stores Northwest Inc. from Kmart and merged it with Thrifty Corp. to form Thrifty Payless Inc. That chain was recently acquired by Rite Aid Corp. K-Mart stock closed up 12.5 cents at $11.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. ","PatriciaCommins"
"The British government is unlikely to block U.S. group CE Electric's 650 pence per share bid for regional electricity company Northern Electric on competition grounds, industry sources said on Thursday. But this view has not stopped concern that Trade Secretary Ian Lang might block the takeover for political reasons, dampening Northern's share price, they added. Lang is widely expected to announce his decision by next Monday, December 16, and CE Electric has put a self-imposed deadline of December 20 on acceptances for its bid. Northern's shares were down 3.5 pence at 598 pence by 1400 GMT, well below the 650 pence level to which CE Electric, which has already snapped up just under 30 percent of its target on the market, raised its original 630 pence offer on December 6. ""Logically, the bid should be cleared. If it does not go through, it will be for entirely political reasons,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. Utilities have come under heavy public criticism over hefty executive pay packets, large shareholder dividends and spiralling takeover prices. Approval of the Northern bid and for the less contentious agreed $2.15 billion offer by U.S. group Dominion Resources for East Midlands Electricity would leave just three independent regional electricity companies (Recs) out of an original 12. East Midlands was due to report half-year results on Monday, but has postponed them until after the decision on Northern. With the ruling Conservatives lagging the opposition Labour Party in polls and an election looming within five months, Lang might defer a potentially unpopular decision by a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), analysts said. ""A referral to the MMC would delay a decision, possibly until after the next election, and if Lang thinks it is enough of a hot potato, he might do that,"" one analyst said. CE Electric, 70 percent owned by CalEnergy, has said it is confident the bid ""has nothing but pro-competitive aspects."" Northern's chairman David Morris, fighting for a higher bid, is also keen to see the offer approved as he felt the regulatory uncertainty was keeping the company's share price down. Northern, which last year spent 560 million pounds ($924.7 million) to fight off a hostile bid from Trafalgar House, now part of Kvaerner, has consistently said the bid undervalues. It has claimed a price of 700 pence per share was indicated in talks between the two firms before the bid was launched on October 28, but the Americans have denied such a price was discussed and analysts said although approval would see shares rising, it was unlikely Northern could secure a higher price. ""I would not think it will go much above 650 pence. Northern has promised dividend increases but investors may well opt for jam today instead of jam tomorrow,"" said one sector analyst. Britain has already nodded through sales of seven of the 12 cash-rich Recs originally privatised, with three going to U.S. companies in a flurry of takeovers in the last two years. But Lang shocked the market in April when he blocked bids by generators National Power and PowerGen for Recs Southern Electric and Midlands Electricity respectively, saying they might pose detriments to competition. Analysts said Lang might opt to approve the bids with conditions, possibly calling for financial guarantees to assuage concerns over CE Electric's debt position, or he might call for ring-fencing of the regulated electricity supply business. Analysts said approval for the current bids could open the floodgates for bids on the remaining Recs -- Southern, Yorkshire and London, which dropped talks with U.S. group Entergy only last month. ""Although there is not a clear, tight policy on these bids, I feel Lang will work more on logic than politics,"" the sector analyst said. ($1=.6056 Pound) ","JoWinterbottom"
"Punitive actions by Japan's Finance Ministry against scandal-tainted Nomura Securities Co Ltd are unlikely for some time, even if Japan's securities watchdog files a complaint against Nomura this week with prosecutors, government sources said on Monday. ""The SESC (the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission) usually recommends punitive action to the Finance Minister after prosecutors complete their investigation of a case and decide whether to issue an indictment or not,"" one source said. How long it takes prosecutors to complete their investigation is expected to depend on how far they intend to pursue the case, he added. Over the weekend, Japanese newspapers reported that the SESC plans to file a complaint this week with prosecutors against former Nomura executives and against Nomura itself, after which Tokyo prosecutors plan to launch a full-scale investigation of the Nomura scandal. Comment was not available from the SESC on Monday. Since late March, prosecutors and the SESC have been investigating Nomura's role in suspected illegal payments to a corporate client linked to a ""sokaiya"" racketeer. Government sources said that Nomura is suspected of violating the Securities and Exchange Law, by illegally using discretionary stock dealings to compensate the corporate client for stock trading losses, and the Commercial Code, by indirectly offering profits to the sokaiya. ""Sokaiya"" extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting or by offering to prevent a disruption of the proceedings by shareholders critical of the company. Japan's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to such racketeers since 1982. By way of example, financial sources noted the case of a smaller brokerage, Chiyoda Securities Co Ltd, that was ordered by MOF in mid-March, 1996 to suspend some of its business. The SESC had first asked prosecutors to bring criminal charges against Chiyoda as early as December 1995. The SESC waited until Chiyoda itself and five executives were indicted in February, 1996, however, before making a proposal to MOF on penalising the brokerage. Media reports in recent days suggested that the scope of the Nomura scandal was widening. The Mainichi Shimbun reported on Monday that there were more than 20 Nomura accounts linked to ""sokaiya"" racketeers in 1995, not including the racketeer at the centre of the current scandal. Nomura declined to comment, stating that the company views the Mainichi report as linked to the current incident under investigation by Japanese regulators. He also said that the company could not comment on accounts of its customers. Mainichi said those accounts were opened at Nomura before 1991, when the brokerage was hit by a scandal involving improper payment of compensation for preferred customers' losses and revelations of deals between its affiliates and gangsters. Mainichi quoted unnamed sources as saying that, after the 1991 scandal, Nomura cancelled accounts of problematic clients but it could not cut its relationship with racketeers. It also quoted a former Nomura executive saying that Nomura transferred profits from trading on its own account to those racketeer-linked accounts, due to its desire to avoid any troubles at its annual shareholders' meetings, it said. In the past month Japanese media have also reported that Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd (DKB) made loans to the corporate client to help the sokaiya secure 300,000 Nomura shares in 1989, which gave him the right to propose the dismissal of executives at shareholders' meetings. The newspapers have also said that prosecutors are investigating DKB loans for a possible link between the racketeer and the bank. DKB repeatedly declined to comment on the reported loans.

"Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that the Czech National Bank may have gone too far in its attempts to slow inflation quickly and the result may have been a slowing in economic growth. Speaking at Prague's Zofin Forum of business leaders Klaus said there was no way quickly to slow inflation, and that central bank steps last year to rein in consumer prices were more than the government wanted. ""At this moment I see in the Czech economy the existence of an array of short-term irremovable inflation factors which we cannot simply get rid of, and I also do not see any easy way to a faster slowing of inflation,"" said Klaus, a monetarist professor of economics. Klaus took issue with restrictive monetary measures of the Czech National Bank last year which helped cut inflation to 7.3 percent year-on-year in February from levels above nine percent in the previous year. He said that the government differed with the central bank on whether montening measures to slow inflation would slow the economy. ""I believe that in our context and in our structural parameters disinflation bought at the high price of a marked loss in the pace of economic growth was more than we would have wished,"" he added. Still, Klaus told audience that February's inflation rate was ""satisfactory"". He said that 1996 full-year gross domestic product growth ended one percent lower than the government originally expected. He did not give a specific result. The government's original forecast was growth of 4.8 percent. Full-year official GDP results are expected later this month. Klaus said factors in this slowing of growth were weak demand for exports because of weak growth and protected markets in western Europe. Another reason was the ""unfavourable structure of our domestic demand -- consumer as well as investment."" Klaus however stressed the ""restrictive measures of the central bank"" and its role on demand as a factor and said the CNB ""used"" the chaos after inconclusive June elections to raise interest rates and tighten minimum reserve requirements. He said the main problem facing the country's economy was a widening trade deficit, but he ruled out a devaluation of the crown to help the situation. ""I am only reminding you that the cure for our trade deficit cannot be any devaluation of the crown and fortunately the government, the central bank and the majority of analysts agree with this,"" Klaus said. The Czech trade deficit, spurred by imports of raw materials and machinery needed for industrial restructuring, widened to a record 160.3 billion crowns for the whole of 1996, up from 95.7 billion the previous year. The deficit is forecast to grow even further in 1997, to around 210-220 billion crowns. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003 ","JohnMastrini"
"U.S. sales of General Motors Corp. cars and trucks in November dropped nearly 12 percent from a year ago because of strikes in the United States and Canada and major model changeovers, the automaker said Tuesday. The world's largest automaker said its total U.S. vehicle sales for the month fell to 336,815 from 382,372 a year earlier. GM car sales plunged 22.5 percent to 179,150, while total truck sales, despite strike-related production losses, rose 4.2 percent to 157,665. GM said walkouts by the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers unions in October and early November reduced the availability of its full size pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, as well as its high-volume Chevrolet Lumina, Monte Carlo, Cavalier and Cadillac DeVille car lines. In addition, sales of several key high-volume models that GM is replacing were down significantly from year ago levels due to model changeovers. ""We expect GM's car maket share to struggle along for about six months,"" said Lincoln Merrihew, auto analyst with DRI/McGraw-Hill in Cambridge, Mass. ""They're running out of old product."" Production of the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars was recently ended, and sales were down 89 percent to 1,494 units. GM dealers have not yet begun selling the cars' replacement, the Chevrolet Malibu. Chevrolet, GM's largest division, had November sales of 169,110, a drop of more than 13 percent from 194,973. Car sales for other GM divisions fell in November, with Pontiac off 7.4 percent, Oldsmobile off 27.6 percent, Buick off 14.5 percent, Cadillac off 11.1 percent and Saturn off 18.3 percent. The automaker also blamed the drop partly on the fact that it has been less aggressive than Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. with incentives on 1997 models. Merrihew said about 15 percent of all 1997 model cars and trucks currently offered rebates of $1,000 or more. For the first 11 months of 1996, GM dealers have sold 4,447,147 total vehicles, down 1.7 percent from the same period of 1995. GM's numbers, which came one day after Chrysler reported a 1 percent increase in November sales, confirmed analyst projections that November will be a weak month for Detroit's Big Three automakers. That was not the case with three Japanese automakers, Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.. Spurred by strong sales of its new Camry sedan, Toyota reported total November sales of 99,241, a 19.6 percent increase. ""Consumer confidence and spending have proven surprisingly resilient in the fourth quarter, driving industry sales far beyond expectations,"" Yale Gieszl, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc., said in a statement. Toyota said it sold 31,644 Camrys last month, a 31 percent increase and its best-ever November performance. Total sport utility sales were 16,268, more than double a year ago. Toyota said its new 4Runner had sales of 9,040, a record for November and an increase of 35.3 percent. The RAV4 mini sport utility continued to exceed sales expectations and had November sales of 5,321. Honda sales rose nearly 16 percent to 70,534, riding the strength of the company's Accord, which had a 41 percent jump in sales to 32,719. While total car sales for Honda rose 16.8 percent to 68,136, Honda light truck sales fell 6 percent to 2,398. Mitsubishi sales for the month rose 13.6 percent to 14,225 units, with a 51.4 percent increase in domestic car sales offsetting declines in import car and truck sales. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. said its U.S. November sales fell 2.5 percent to 51,325 cars, due to a 12.4 percent drop in domestic car sales. Ford is expected to report its sales results on Wednesday. ","DavidLawder"
"Huntington Bancshares Inc. said Monday it agreed to acquire First Michigan Bank Corp., a Michigan banking company, in a deal valued at $898 million. The deal comes just months after Holland, Mich.-based First Michigan said it had been targeted by a different company. A First Michigan spokeswoman would not say who made the previous offer, or how it compared to the Huntington deal. First Michigan shares fell 87.5 cents to $29.875 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon, after having jumped to as high as $30.75 in recent weeks on takeover speculation. Under the definitive agreement, Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington Bancshares will offer 1.05 shares of its stock for each First Michigan share in a fixed exchange that is expected to be a tax-free pooling of interests. The deal originally was valued at $31.50 per share or $908 million, based on Friday's closing stock price for Huntington. Huntington stock, however, fell 50 cents to $29.50 on Nasdaq on Monday, lowering the value of the deal. ""It's an expensive price here,"" said Joseph Duwan, analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. He noted that the deal valued First Michigan at 3.1 times book value and about 19 times 1996 earnings. But First Michigan is also seen as a well-run franchise, in a western Michigan market that is attractive for its diverse economic base. Huntington is not currently in the western Michigan market, analysts noted. ""It's very pricey, but the point is I don't think anybody could have gotten First of Michigan without doing at least an at-market deal,"" said James Schutz, analyst at Chicago Corp. All of First Michigan's 90 banking offices in the state will be merged into Huntington's lead subsidiary, Huntington National Bank. First Michigan has assets of $3.6 billion. The combined company would have assets in excess of $25 billion, stockholders' equity of about $1.9 billion and a market capitalisation of about $5.2 billion. ""This merger significantly expands our Michigan market share and enables us to realise important synergies in our consumer, commercial and fee-based businesses,"" said Frank Wobst, chairman and chief executive of Huntington. ""Upon completion of this transaction, Huntington will have approximately $6 billion in assets in Michigan making it our second-largest market after Ohio."" The acquisition is expected to boost Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington's earnings slightly in 1998 and increase profits by 4 percent in 1999, he said. A pre-tax merger-related charge of about $35 million will be recognised in the quarter the merger is completed. The merger is expected to result in annual cost savings of at least $19 million, or 15 percent of Michigan's expense base in 1998, by eliminating redundancy and excess capacity. The deal is expected to close late in the third quarter, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. Huntington has warrants to buy up to 19.9 percent of First Michigan's outstanding shares at an exercise price of $29.275 per share if the deal does not close under certain circumstances. Huntington Bancshares, with assets in excess of $21 billion, operates 355 offices in Ohio, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and West Virginia. It also has 81 mortgage, trust, investment banking, and automobile finance offices in those states as well as in Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

"British leisure group Rank Group Plc said on Thursday that it planned to open a further 36 Hard Rock cafes internationally over the next three years. The expansion programme for the themed diners will be launched in July and cafes will open at the rate of one a month until the year 2000, the company said. Rank, which last year reunited the Hard Rock brand worldwide, said the outlook for its businesses was promising after a year in which an exceptional charge of 232 million pounds ($375 million) badly hit profits. Profit before tax in 1996 fell to 65 million pounds from 515 million the year before. However, the 1995 figure was boosted by a 236 million pound exceptional gain. Rank raised its net dividend by eight percent to 17 pence per share and said operating profit before exceptional items was 13 percent higher at 290 million pounds. The company, which is in the process of a radical restructuring, said that it expected to create 3,000 jobs in Britain this year as it opened new pubs, cinemas, holiday and leisure centres and bingo clubs. The news was welcomed by British National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley, who saw it as a further boost to the nation's thriving tourist industry. ""This is excellent news for Britain and underlines the tourism industry's role as one of our major job creators and wealth generators,"" she said. Rank shares, which have underperformed the market by 20 percent over the past year, added 19.5p to 434.5p. Share analysts said that the price had been bolstered by Rank's plans to ask its shareholders for permission to buy back up to 10 percent of the company's stock. Chief executive Andrew Teare said that Rank was well set after a decision to focus on four divisions -- Hard Rock, Holidays, Leisure and Film and Entertainment Services. ""These changes, together with the benefits of our investment programme and the generally favourable economic climate, provide a promising outlook for Rank,"" Teare said. Rank last year won outright control of the Hard Rock brand worldwide when it bought the cafes and brand rights owned by Peter Morton, one of the joint founders of the chain in 1971. Ownership of the brand had previously been split. There are plans this year to launch a television series based on the brand and a new Hard Rock Records label has also been announced. Teare said Rank planned to sell its film distribution unit, which has a catalogue of classic British films dating back to the 1950s as well as some more modern American movies. Newspapers have speculated that the sale might raise up to 150 million pounds but Teare indicated he thought some of the figures in the press were on the high side. The exceptional charges related mainly to a 148 million pound property value writedown, plus a loss on disposals and charge for restructuring. Comparisons with last year were further complicated by a change in the way Rank accounts for its remaining 20 percent interest in Rank Xerox, its office equipment joint venture with America's Xerox Corp. Rank repeated that it planned to sell the stake when a suitable opportunity arises. However, Teare told analysts that he had not yet discussed the sale with Xerox. ($1=.6184 Pound) ","KeithWeir"
"Using cost cuts to offset flat same-store sales, discount retail giant Kmart Corp. Wednesday reported a $9 million third-quarter profit, compared with a year-ago loss of $69 million. The results, equal to 2 cents a share, slightly exceeded Wall Street analysts' consensus expectation that the Troy, Mich.-based retailer would break even during the August-October period. Nevertheless, Kmart stock closed down 62.5 cents at $10.50 on the New York Stock Exchange after Chairman Floyd Hall dismissed rumors that Kmart was the target of a possible takeover by leveraged buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The rumors drove Kmart's stock up $1.625 on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters at the opening of Kmart's second Manhattan store, Hall said he has not heard from KKR. ""As far as we know, they are all rumors,"" he said. In a statement accompanying the third-quarter results, Hall said Kmart is ""beginning to see meaningful progress toward a recovery."" ""Our biggest challenge of the year lies just ahead in the fourth quarter, and we remain cautiously optimistic about our near-term outlook,"" he added. But sales growth has been a tough challenge since Hall was hired to rebuild Kmart in June 1995. Kmart's total revenues for the quarter fell 1.6 percent from last year to $7.85 billion. Company-wide same-store sales rose 0.1 percent from a year ago and same-store sales for U.S. Kmart stores increased 0.8 percent. Hall said revenues did not meet the company's growth expectations for the period, but savings from store closings, contracting out of certain functions and other costs cuts have resulted in a $370 million reduction in Kmart's year-to-date selling, general and administrative expenses. But Kmart's gross margin rate for the third quarter increased to 22.6 percent of sales from 21.2 percent last year, reflecting fewer markdowns to clear aged inventory and a lower level of overall promotional activity, Kmart said. Analysts said the slow sales growth suggests that Kmart is still losing market share to archrivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. But they were pleased with Kmart's 8 percent reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period. ""If you compare it with last year, the company is making considerable progress. The part of the equation that remains is to get the sales up,"" said Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Joseph Ronning. Kmart executives told analysts in a conference call that they expect better sales results in the near future from their apparel offerings -- particularly children's clothing -- and the ""pantry concept"" stores, which offer several aisles of attractively priced consumable items such as soft drinks and snacks just inside the front entrance. Kmart now has about 180 pantry concept stores in the United States and will change 450 stores to the new format annually for the next couple of years. Hall also told reporters that Kmart is aiming for a 3.5 percent to 5 percent increase in same-store sales for the all-important holiday selling period. Kmart could achieve a 6-7 percent increase, Hall said. But he cautioned that he didn't want to sacrifice profit margins to achieve that figure. Still, he said analysts' estimates that Kmart will earn a profit of $165.5 million for the fourth quarter ending in January 1997 were ""reasonable."" Kmart, the second largest retailer in the United States, operates 2,143 Kmart and 168 Builders Square retail outlets, and operates 129 stores internationally. ","DavidLawder"
"Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec on Monday said his country viewed as frivolous and ""absolutely unacceptable"" Russian hints of economic reprisals for Prague's entry into NATO. ""We consider it frivolous to connect the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance with bilateral (Czech-Russian) relations and threaten economic sanctions in this context,"" the Czech news agency CTK quoted Zieleniec as saying. Moscow's ambassador to Prague, Nikolai Ryabov, warned the Czech Republic on Sunday that key bilateral agreements with Russia might be jeopardised if it joined NATO. Ryabov told Russia's NTV commercial television that the former Warsaw Pact member's entry into the Western defence alliance could mean a damaging loss of arms markets for Moscow. The ambassador went on to hint that Moscow could reconsider economic deals with Prague if it went ahead. ""Agreements fundamental to the Czech Republic, such as gas deliveries and nuclear energy, create a basis for future problems that our countries would face,"" he said. Zieleniec told CTK that Ryabov's statement made it clear why the Czechs wanted to join Western organisations. ""This type of demand is one of the reasons why it is important...at the earliest, to become a member of the key Western political, economic, and security organisations,"" Zieleniec said. He said he thought the ambassador's interview on Russian television was mostly for media consumption. The Czechs, Poland and Hungary are expected to be named among the first former-Soviet Bloc countries to be invited to join NATO at a July summit of the alliance in Madrid. After the collapse of former communist trade arrangements in the early part of the decade, total Czech trade turnover with Russia grew 9.8 percent in 1996 to $2.8 billion. But it was heavily weighted in Russia's favour with Czech exports to Russia at $694 million while imports from Russia were $2.1 billion. Czechs are still dependent on Russia for natural gas and most of their crude oil, but Prague is in the final stages of negotiations of a long-term contract for some of its gas supplies to come from Norway. Last year, the Czechs opened the Ingolstadt spur in the Transalpine crude pipeline from the Adriatic Sea, providing direct access to crude from the Middle East. The Czech power company CEZ a.s. is also dependent on Russian nuclear fuel for its lone atomic power station at Dukovany. But the company is expected to take U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel when it opens a new plant at Temelin by the end of the century. The Czech army is also considering several offers to modernise its mostly Soviet-era equipment with Western-made, NATO-compatible goods. ","JohnMastrini"
"Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) is developing a new computerised memory system to ensure pallets fit into aircraft first time and avoid potentially costly delays, the company's deputy managing director Yueng Kwok Keung told Reuters in an interview. HACTL hopes the new system, provisionally called a Pallet Contour Identification System, will save time, money and arguments with truck drivers insisting their cargo is packed properly. Each arriving cargo will have to pass through a gantry fitted with precise measurement sensors which send high speed signals of a three dimensional picture to a computer. A memory bank contains a complete catalogue of all possible container contours and exact dimensions of each individual aircraft which use HACTL. If the shape fits, the computer identifies the container as ""good to go"" and allows it to continue its journey. If the shape does not conform, the computer rejects it, long before handlers struggle to try to squeeze it into an aircraft, Yueng said. ""It's a very simple idea which can speed up the truck dock procedures and increase the reliability of container reception. It ensures there are no delays and every aircraft takes off with its intended load,"" Yueng said. HACTL intends to test the prototype during the second quarter of this year at Kai Tak, continuously refine the design and implement the final design at the company's SuperTerminal One complex now under construction at Hong Kong's new airport. Yeung, who is credited by observers as playing a leading role in developing HACTL's renowned computerised handling technology, said the new development could eventually be marketed to other air cargo operators around the world. The cost of developing the new system has not been disclosed. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44-171-542-7706 Fax+44-171-542-5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"Tin production at one of China's biggest mines has been cut by summer flooding, but a lacklustre market means business has not been affected, an executive with Deng's Yunnan Tin Corp said on Monday. Gejiu Tin Mine in southern Yunnan province was damaged by floods in June and July, deputy general manager Sheng Weichung told Reuters. Deng's Yunnan Tin Corp is the Hong Kong representative and trading arm of Yunnan Tin Corp, China's biggest tin producer.   In 1995, Sheng said, Yunnan Tin Corp produced 20,000 tonnes of tin. The Gejiu mine was the company's biggest, he said. ""But business has been slow in China because the world market is soft and because of domestic restructuring of the industry, changes in government policy and tight credit,"" Sheng said. ""So a cut in production at the Gejiu mine would not have any adverse affect on China's overall tin industry picture."" It was unclear how extensive the damage to the mine was, he said, or by how much production had been cut.   China expected to produce 45,000 tonnes of tin in 1996, an official of the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp said in July. He forecast 1996 exports of 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes. Total 1995 tin exports were 43,307 tonnes, down 2.4 percent on the year before, China's State Statistical Bureau reported. Total Chinese tin production for the first half of 1996 was down 6.14 percent on the same 1995 period, to 25,944 tonnes, the figures show.   Exports for the first half of 1996 of unwrought tin and tin alloys were 12,867 tonnes, down 27 percent on the first half of 1995, customs figures show. Tin exports in June were 3,339 tonnes. Despite its size and the high quality of its product, Yunnan Tin Corp was still a ""loss-making state enterprise"" and as such was facing tough times, Sheng said. A labour force of 100,000 had been cut within the past two years to 40,000 with the introduction of a redundancy programme that offered lump sum payments, he said.   Senior management had also been trying to raise capital abroad to help get expansion projects off the ground, he said. Other metals markets in China continued slow, traders said. A return to pre-summer volatility that saw London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices fluctuate sharply throughout last week would keep China business slow, traders said. Three month copper values on the LME traded between $1,905 and $1,970 a tonne in the July 30-August 29 period, giving traders some hope that calm had returned to the market after Sumitomo Corp revealed in June it had lost US$1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised trading.   But the calm was shortlived. On September 2, copper prices spiked to a 2-1/2 month high of $2,195, before slumping back on Friday to $1,915. ""I think the market will go down again,"" a trader in Singapore said. A lack of buyers for Chinese aluminium products had led to domestic stockbuilding, trading sources said. ""They are in the market to export, but there is no real market for them...we are not touching it,"" another source said. Singapore premiums for zinc were firm at around $65-70 over the LME cash price, traders said.   Another source added the only zinc available for trading in Singapore was Chinese, ""and the Chinese are working on a fixed price basis"" of around $1,080 to $1,120 a tonne.

"The Clinton administration gave a solid boost this week to congressional efforts to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws but substantial hurdles remain, participants in the debate said. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the administration's plan to eliminate the 1933 Glass-Steagall legal barriers separating banks from securities firms and insurance companies. The administration plan was due to Congress by March 31 and the nearly two-month delay had some lobbyists fearing that the administration would avoid the tangled regulatory controversies and not submit anything. Congress has sought to reform banking laws for more than a decade, but one interest group or another has always managed to block passage of legislation. In prior years, banks sought reform, while other financial firms opposed change. Recently, courts and regulators have granted banks new authority, however. That brought insurance companies and securities firms to the table to seek a level playing field. ""There is renewed hope that the 105th Congress will tackle this difficult issue,"" said David Farmer, lobbyist for the Alliance of American Insurers, after Rubin's speech. The action now shifts to the Banking committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate, where detailed reform measures will be drafted. Rubin will provide more details of the Clinton plan in testimony before Congress on June 3. House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach said this week that drafting will begin immediately after that testimony and that he wants committee action completed by mid-June. It is at the drafting stage where some past efforts to reform banking laws have foundered as competing interests fought over the details. The new administration proposal ducked one of the most contentious issues -- whether banks should be allowed to combine with non-financial, commercial firms. Instead of taking sides, Rubin offered two alternatives. Under one plan, banks would be allowed a limited amount of commercial activity, but the largest 1,000 commercial companies could not own or be owned by banks. Under a second alternative, the current prohibition would be continued, but the current exception allowing savings and loans to be owned by commercial companies would also be maintained. Several months ago, administration officials were discussing proposals to allow nearly unlimited mixing of banking and commerce. The apparent retreat left advocates of greater mixing fuming. ""Their recommendation is tantamount to surrender on the issue,"" Minnesota Democrat Rep. Bruce Vento said. Vento and New Jersey Republican Rep. Marge Roukema introduced a bill in January that would allow banks to have a ""basket"" of commercial activity accounting for up to 25 percent of an institution's total business. Another blow to Vento and Roukema's efforts came Thursday when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the House Banking Committee. Greenspan said Congress should eliminate Glass-Steagall now, but put off the banking and commerce issue for future review. ""Any wider authorization of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernization,"" he said. Now the banking and commerce issue threatens to derail their backing, said bank consultant Karen Shaw Petrou, president of ISD/Shaw Inc. ""The administration's plan is a decent baby-step,"" Petrou said. ""But unsurprisingly, it's not the lightning bolt that transforms the debate."" Securities firms and insurance companies are involved in commercial activity, but want to get into banking if banks are allowed into their fields. ""If you don't allow banking and commerce, then you create obstacles for non-banks,"" Petrou said. ""But somebody's twist or turn to solve that then creates another problem for someone else."" Even a small percentage limit on commercial activity would accommodate the largest non-bank financial companies, according to research from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released on Thursday. Among the seven securities firms in the Fortune 1000, plus Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., none earned much more than 5 percent of their revenue from commercial activity in 1996, the FDIC estimated. Only one of the five largest life and health insurers and one of the five largest property and casualty firms exceeded the 5 percent level, the FDIC said. Four of the 10 largest diversified financial firms would exceed the 5 percent level, however. American Express derived 9 to 14 percent of its revenue from commercial activities, for example, and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc. had 28 percent of revenues from commerce. ","AaronPressman"
"Royal Bank of Scotland has seen its corporate and institutional banking (CIB) unit show good growth in recent years using a strategy which rejects any idea of competing in the increasingly crowded investment banking world. Its managing director Iain Robertson told Reuters in an interview that CIB now produces some 30 percent of the banks profits, a figure expected to rise to around 40 percent. ""We are not an investment bank and we're not a securities house,"" Robertson said, ""and frankly, I don't have the billion pounds that I would actually have to spend to become one, nor have I any desire to do so."" Royal Bank's strategy contrasts with some others which have been devoting large amounts of capital, investment and other resources in fully-fledged investment banking with, to say the least, questionable returns. Royal Bank's success has been based on its traditional features which have been updated by Robertson who insists that it will persist along its current profitable line. CIB has seen those profits rise to 207 million stg last year from 43 million in 1991 and they are expected by analysts to rise again in the 1996/97 results to be announced soon. These figures produce a return of over 20 percent on risk adjusted equity -- highly respectable and a lot better than some higher profile investment banking operations. Since October 1 last year, Royal Bank has been running all of its corporate relationships, big and small in CIB whereas previously only large corporates, financial institutions and companies with a turnover of over 100 million stg, were grouped there. The transfer of small and medium corporates will immediately raise CIB's share of profits of the group to 40 percent and Robertson sees this staying fairly stable given that the retail side will also grow. The move to bring in the small and medium corporate sectors into CIB stemmed from the fact that Royal Bank's retail operation has developed a much stronger personal focus in the last few years and managers perceived that the smaller corporate customers no longer identified with the retail side. Robertson, a Glaswegian who came to Royal Bank after being deputy chief executive at County NatWest, the forerunner of NatWest Markets, is delighted that, in the homogenous world of modern banking, CIB has some ""unique"" features to offer. He said Royal Bank was well known among its clients for having probably the shortest management lines in the business and has brought in staff with a big diversity of experience outside banking. ""In areas like property, we have brought in professionals who know the terms and conditions of property investment -- what will stick and what will not stick."" Robertson says he wanted CIB to be the leading independent provider of corporate banking services in the UK. ""We have no axe to grind in terms of providing equity or securities or anything else. We will tell them what we think they can achieve in the debt markets and we'll put our corporate reputation behind what we say,"" he added. CIB's major business groupings are Treasury and Capital Markets including foreign exchange; bond sales; securitisation, Structured Finance, which includes syndicated loans; project finance; and credit trading and Risk Finance which includes acquisition finance and development capital and Trust Bank which is substantial investor services business. The group has main offices in Edinburgh and Manchester as well as London. Robertson said the bank wanted to develop its niche products outside the UK possibly with joint ventures such as that in project finance with Banco Santander in South America. Royal Bank has a high quality book of around $1.0 billion in the US but sees little opportunity for indigenous major growth. In the core business, he also sees the opportunity to grab market share from competitors by adopting the same strategy seen in its large corporate business of cross-selling products. ","JoeOrtiz"
"The man who watched Indonesia's Busang, the largest gold discovery of the century, slip from his grasp is gracious in defeat. Peter Munk, chairman and chief executive of Canada's Barrick Gold Corp. said on Tuesday he still has faith in Indonesia and its mining law, despite losing the battle for the Busang gold deposit to Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. last week. ""It's in good hands now and I wish them all the good luck,"" Munk, 69, told Reuters in a telephone interview from Switzerland. Munk and a team of executives and high-profile advisers -- including former U.S. President George Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney -- spent months wooing the Indonesian government in an effort to win control of Busang. In a race that included most of the world's biggest mining concerns, Barrick, the world's second largest gold company, initially dominated the negotiations for control of Busang, which was discovered and 90 percent-owned by Calgary, Alberta-based prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd.. Busang contains at least 71 million ounces of gold, valued at about $25 billion, but Bre-X and others believe the size of the deposit may be much larger. Late last year the Indonesian government told Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick and set a deadline for Feb. 17. But Munk's glittering inside track to success ended abruptly when the government of President Suharto last month brought in Muhammad ""Bob"" Hasan, an Indonesian timber tycoon with extensive business interests, many friends in the mining community and close ties with Suharto. ""Control was not in my hands. It was really not any more in the government's hands,"" Munk said. ""It was transferred to Mr. Hasan's hands. He was appointed to make the final say and make the final decision. ""I did not know of Mr. Hasan's existence until the middle of January when I was informed by the government. He was not involved."" Shunning Barrick, Hasan brokered a deal that gave Freeport 15 percent of Busang and the right to mine the deposit. The arrangement left Bre-X with 45 percent and handed the rest to the Indonesian government and to two Indonesian companies controlled by Hasan. Bre-X received no compensation in the deal. Despite being thwarted in the end game, Munk said he harbored no resentment. ""So is life,"" he said philosophically. ""It's given me a great amount of encouragement. Busang is not the largest gold find in Indonesia,"" he predicted. ""I think there will be many more gold finds and we intend to find many of them."" The Bre-X case was an exception, Munk said, adding that he still had faith that Indonesian mining laws would serve him well in the future. ""Bre-X was a very unfortunate example and I think it is in no way an indication of the stability of the mining industry and the interests of the international mining community in Indonesia,"" he said. ""We intend to pursue our program in Indonesia with a great amount of vigor."" But Barrick's plans do not include any fresh attempt to bid for Busang, despite the riches contained in the deposit. Munk said he was ""absolutely not interested"" in a project that Barrick could not control. ""We've (grown) without Busang and we will continue to do it without Busang,"" he said. ""But we will not sacrifice the fundamental principles on which we built our company. That ends and begins with controlling our own mine."" ","HeatherScoffield"
"The U.S. government is scrambling to update thousands of computer systems and software programmes that might otherwise see Jan. 1, 2000, as ""00"" and think they are operating in 1900. ""We are confident that all of the major systems will be fixed,"" said Sally Katzen, who is coordinating much of the repair effort from her post as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget. ""That is what we are setting out to do and that is what we will do,"" she pledged in an interview. Legislators in Congress have also taken an interest in the subject and prodded agencies into action. Most are well aware of the problem, congressional staff say, although a few slackers, including the air traffic control system, are raising concerns. ""Congress is sounding the alarm and will keep sounding it until this problem is solved,"" Representative Steve Horn said in an interview. Horn, chairman of the Government Reform Committee's Management, Information and Technology subcommittee, has taken testimony from a variety of government and private-sector experts on the year 2000 problem. ""I have learned that the real challenge it poses is to management,"" Horn said. ""Software experts are capable of fixing the problem, but can management understand what is at stake, make it a priority, organise a plan and allocate resources so the technical experts can do their job?"" The subcommittee surveyed government agencies about year 2000 awareness last year and responses to an updated survey have just come in. The latest survey found that all agencies are aware of the problem and most are ready to put the needed fixes in place, a congressional staffer said. Some of the agencies that people are most concerned about, the Defence Department and the Social Security Administration, appear to be in good shape and have extensive plans to fix the problem well before Dec. 31, 1999. At the Defence Department, ""we are treating it much as we would a computer virus,"" Assistant Secretary of Defence Emmett Paige told Horn's subcommittee. Although weapons systems are not set to launch automatically by computers, problems could crop up when the weapons interact with command and control systems that are operated by computers, congressional staffers explained. During the Gulf War, a command and control system that was scheduled to run for 12 hours began shutting down weapon systems it was in contact with after running a few hours past its deadline. ""That would obviously be a disaster, but they're working on it,"" said one staff member. Social Security is also a primary focus of concern, but for more political reasons. Millions of voters depend on their Social Security checks for meeting basic living expenses. If the checks were delayed or cancelled, Congress would probably be inundated with thousands of complaints. ""They started the earliest but they have a lot to do and still aren't finished,"" a staff member said. ""My sense is that they will be fine."" One agency of concern, according to congressional staffers, is the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates the country's air traffic control system and inspects commercial airplanes. ""The Department of Transportation is very worrisome,"" one staffer said. ""The FAA is still in the assessment phase. That's the one that's a real concern."" The agency cannot give an estimate of how many lines of code it has that must be changed or how much that might cost until it completes an assessment expected by the end of May, according to Mary Powers-King, who heads the FAA's information technology effort. ""It's somewhat painful because no new funding has been appropriated and we're having to reprogram to absorb the activity,"" Powers-King said. ""That is a big part of the reason why we started late. We've got that figured out now and we've got to just bite the bullet."" Overall, recent estimates indicate the federal government will need to spend $2.4 to $2.5 billion to identify and correct year 2000 computer problems, Katzen said. The estimate has risen slightly from about $2.3 billion a few months ago. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see them come another ($100 to $300 million) as we continue through the process of assessment,"" Katzen said. ""But I think that we've got it in just about the right ballpark."" In a Feb. 7, 1997, report to Congress, the budget office projected that the military needed the largest portion of the money for updates. The Air Force would require $371 million, the Army $218 million, the Navy $90 million and other defence-related areas $291 million. Other big spenders in the report were the Treasury Department, needing $319 million, and the Veterans Administration, needing $144 million. ","AaronPressman"
"Like any marriage, the $20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc may be smoothed by the experiences of a two-year courtship that preceded it. ""I may be an incurable romantic, but I think this is going to be a lot easier than people think,"" said one BT insider. Concert, the name of the planned merged entity, was also the original name for a global communications offspring conceived by the two companies in July 1994 to provide one-stop shopping for multinational corporations.   While the executives atop the planned merged company have a clear vision of where they are going, insiders and industry sources say the acid test will be how the engine rooms of networks, billing, support and customer service are melded. The initial partnership, now called Concert Communication Services, was a wayward child in its early days. Its progress was slowed by turf wars and bickering about which standard or system to use. ""Some of those turf wars were really destructive,"" said Daniel Briere, a consultant at TeleChoice Inc, who has worked with Concert Communications and its parents.   A computer and software to support pre-paid Concert calling cards in Britain were delayed for many months while BT and MCI managers fought to have their own design used. Similarly. a videophone product developed by BT for MCI failed on both sides of the Atlantic, at a cost of millions of dollars. BT has built a voicemail system called Callminder, but it cannot be upgraded to serve larger systems. ""This huge hands across-the-water friendship never worked in practice that I saw,"" Briere said.   Still, sources inside both companies believe the tough decisions have already been made, and a unified management can more easily resolve the remaining issues precisely because of the experience they already have in working together in Concert. ""Those debates by and large are behind us,"" said MCI Chief Engineering Officer Fred Briggs. ""A unified management always shortens the decision-making process some,"" he added. ""It may sound weird, but you take out the need for cooperation. You can choose the best and discard the rest,"" TeleChoice's Briere said.   BT began as a state-owned monopoly, while MCI cut its teeth fighting against a former monopoly, AT&amp;T. BT controls 90 percent of the British market, while MCI has struggled to breach 20 percent of the U.S. long-distance market. The size of the combined company has raised some concern that MCI's nimbleness and aggression will be lost. The new Concert will rank among the three largest telephone companies in the world, with revenues of $42 billion and 183,000 employees. It will have a pro forma market capitalization of $54 billion.   ""Customers will expect a lot more from MCI now that it is on an equal footing with AT&amp;T. It will be harder for MCI to retain that scrappy upstart image,"" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom. One potential flashpoint is the likely need to use BT billing and support systems to help pry open the U.S. local calling markets, worth $90 billion a year. Though MCI has advanced billing systems, it has never had to cope with an attack of that scale.   A second potential difficulty involves international calling, where BT and MCI plan a replication of calling plans such as MCI's Friends and Family -- used to great effect within the United States -- to cement customer ties on both sides of the Atlantic. ""There are plans in the works for that sort of thing,"" said the BT insider, declining to be identified. But BT has never had to administer calling plans of the complexity of MCI's Friends and Family, which generates a high level of customer-service queries.   The two companies also plan to use Britain as a conduit to grab international business calling from continental Europe and route it through London to the United States. Another major issue is what type of technology to use to bring Internet and multimedia applications to U.S. homes. BT is expected to be closely involved as a pioneer in so-called broadband technologies. ""That is going to be a major decision,"" MCI's Briggs said. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610 ","NickLouth"

"Nickel prices have been in the doldrums in the third quarter, disappointing Canada's big nickel producers who had forecast an increase in prices and a boost to profits. Canada's two nickel giants, Inco Ltd and Falconbridge Ltd, are also experiencing copper woes. The unexpectedly low metal prices ""will likely take a bite out of our third-quarter earnings compared to previous earnings,"" Falconbridge chief financial officer Lars-Eric Johansson said in an interview. Copper prices collapsed after Sumitomo Corp said its chief trader helped run up US$1.8 billion in losses through unauthorized trading over a decade. Only recently has copper showed signs of life. For nickel, Johansson blamed the sluggish prices on faltering European and southeast Asian economies. ""In the very short term, the fundamentals are obviously not there,"" he said. ""The overall global economy is not doing as well as we had hoped for."" But he added: ""We expect the demand for nickel to pick up, maybe not this quarter but during the fourth quarter or to be more conservative, early next year."" Inco was also optimistic, with Inco executive vice president of marketing Peter Salathiel saying: ""The potential for a nickel spike still exists. The time frame has been shifted from say the first half of '96 to the fourth quarter of '96 or the first quarter of '97."" Salathiel blamed a glut in stainless steel this year for nickel's poor performance. Stainless steel consumes about two-thirds of the world's nickel output. Nickel demand and supply are currently on a par, Salathiel said. He said that with nickel demand expected to remain steady for the next few months, nickel prices should rebound once stainless steel production picks up and the European and Asian economies strengthen. But Richardson Greenshields analyst Ray Goldie said the nickel price should have picked up by now. He has seen growing demand along with a steady supply, laying the groundwork for a rise in prices. ""The fundamentals have worked beautifully,"" he said. ""Despite gloomy talk about the stainless steel industry, which is the major consuming industry, the most recent figures show nickel consumption is growing. Supply can't keep up and inventories are declining."" So why did nickel fail to spike? ""The fact that nothing has gone wrong may be one reason,"" said Goldie. He said that nickel companies produced at capacity with no strikes or disruptions and that it might take such a disruption to knock the nickel price out of joint. The floundering nickel market could spell trouble for stocks that trade on nickel prices, he added. The stock market has built in an expectation of a moderate price increase, said Goldie and ""if the price of nickel were to go sideways for the next six months, that would be a disappointment and the shares would go down,"" he said. ""But I don't believe there's an expectation we'll see sustained prices over US$4."" Nickel was trading today at US$3.46 a pound. Bank of Nova Scotia economist Patricia Mohr predicted nickel prices of at least US$4 a pound by early 1997. She expected stainless steel stocks to be depleted in the fourth quarter, leading to increased demand for nickel in the first quarter of next year. ""There isn't very much new mine supply coming on in the near future,"" said Mohr. ""So you do have the potential for prices to certainly move higher."" Analysts expect third-quarter earnings for Inco to fall to US$0.29 a share from year earlier US$0.33, with Falconbridge earnings declining to C$0.18 a share from C$0.47 in last year's third quarter, according to estimates compiled by I/B/E/S. -- Reuters Toronto Bureau 416-941-8104 ","HeatherScoffield"
"Far East metals traders on Monday waited for London Metal Exchange (LME) reaction to reports that Australia's MIM will halve 1997 zinc supplies to Europe. MIM Holdings Ltd said it was holding talks with customers worldwide on the impact of reduced zinc production this year. Nick Stump, chief executive of MIM, declined to comment on a Reuters report quoting european smelter sources as saying that MIM would reduce zinc supplies to Europe by half this year. ""There is definitely a shift to Asia, although to what extent we will have to wait and see,"" Stump told Reuters in Sydney. LME zinc prices were expected to rise -- one Chinese trader in Hong Kong predicted zinc would hit new highs on the news -- but little direct impact was seen on the Asian market. LME zinc has traded at dizzy heights recently, hitting two-year highs last week of $1,174 a tonne. Consistent falls in LME stocks indicated the physical market would confirm the strong futures trend. Last trade on Friday was $1,169, up $33 a tonne. China exports around a quarter of its annual zinc output. Official figures show 1996 exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys rose to 226,777 tonnes, over 1995's 191,526 tonnes. December 1996 exports alone were 29,519 tonnes. Asian trading sources said that while the impact of the MIM news on Chinese prices would be limited, the continuing climb of world prices would encourage China's zinc producers to export. ""Chinese smelters are looking at the LME price and so domestic supply is quite high now,"" the Chinese trader, who represents Chinese producers in Hong Kong, said. Domestic Chinese prices for LME-registered brands of Chinese zinc, like Torch, had hit 9,600 yuan ($1,156) per tonne, he said. Long-term export contracts done by his company had been settled at $1,170 per tonne FOB (free on board) at major Chinese ports, he said. Costly freight between China and Europe would keep most of the Chinese product in the region, Chinese and Western sources said. Vinod Kumar, director of Donald McCarthy in Singapore, said Chinese shipments of zinc ingots to Singapore in the past month totalled around 20,000 tonnes. ""I hear there are another 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes on the way,"" he said. He said China's total shipments of zinc in the past month to customers in the region, including South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, were 100,000 to 120,000 tonnes. ""This is a fairly heavy level of activity,"" he said, adding that most of the material in Singapore was being kept off-warrant and therefore would not show up in LME stock figures. ""We are not putting what we buy on warrant, but selling directly to customers,"" Kumar said. Kumar predicted a rise in LME stocks on Tuesday of around 3,000 tonnes. LME zinc stocks on Friday stood at 482,925 tonnes. A metals trader in Shanghai said unregistered Chinese zinc ingots were arriving at major Chinese ports at the LME spot price, less $25-30 a tonne on quality. Her company was buying small lots -- up to 300 tonnes at a time -- to sell onto Japanese customers, she said. ""Demand is there as long as the quality is not too bad,"" she said. Copper premiums were firming in some areas of the region, another trading source said. Premiums to South Korea had firmed in the past week to $80-90 a tonne, from $70 last week, on rumours of a major short position being held there. Premiums on arrivals at major Japanese and Taiwanese ports were steady at around $70-75 a tonne, traders said. The Chinese New Year holiday officially begins on Thursday, February 6, and lasts five days but has already seen business activity throughout the region slow to a standstill that is expected to last until mid-February.

"The French government set out on Wednesday the procedure for privatising defence electronics company Thomson-CSF, including minimum financial terms and conditions. The terms and conditions mark the government's second attempt to sell Thomson-CSF through a private sale after a first effort failed last year when the state tried to sell it as part of the Thomson SA electronics group. The successful bidder or group would become the majority owner by acquiring more than 50 percent of Thomson-CSF's capital and voting rights, the finance ministry said in a statement. The government said on Tuesday it hoped to pick the winning bidder by June 30. Firms bidding must have at least five billion francs ($868 million) in equity capital and the same amount in turnover in non-consumer and defence electronics, it said on Wednesday. The government reaffirmed it would hold a ""golden share"" which gives it an effective veto over any changes in ownership to protect the state's strategic defence interests. The statement said that in the case of a group bid, the lead company must plan to hold more than a third of Thomson-CSF's capital and voting rights. Bidders must declare themselves by 1100 GMT on March 28. The finance ministry would tell the candidates whether they were eligible within five working days, the ministry said. Offers must be delivered by 1100 GMT on May 7 and bidders must make an irrevocable offer to buy Thomson-CSF within four months of that date. In a group bid, the partners must set out planned individual holdings and the contractual relations that exist between the companies, the statement said. Thomson-CSF's capital consists of 119.5 million shares, of which 41.7 percent is in public hands. The rest is owned by Thomson SA and Sofivision, with the state holding one share. Thomson SA is state-controlled. Some 6.65 million Thomson-CSF shares will be reserved for employees and former staff. The Thomson-CSF privatisation is part of the state's aim to restructure the defence industry around a few ""national champions"" as a step towards wider European consolidation. Engineering group Alcatel Alsthom and missiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere Groupe have said they are interested in bidding. Thomson-CSF makes radars, tactical missiles, radios and integrated complex systems as a defence prime contractor. The independent Privatisation Commission thwarted the government's first attempt to sell Thomson SA last year. Then it objected to the planned sale of the group to Lagardere, which in turn wanted to sell the loss-making Thomson Multimedia unit to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea for a symbolic one franc.

"The Czech crown, boosted recently by demand brought about by a wave of Eurobond issues, is showing no sign of losing strength, prompting market speculation on Wednesday of possible central bank intervention. The Czech National Bank (CNB) has said it is monitoring the development of the crown, but is prepared to allow the market to decide its rate within the fluctuation band. Since the start of 1997 the currency has gained some three percentage points against its fixing basket, mainly on foreign buying to finance a wave of some 30 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) in new crown Eurobond issues. Analysts said that while the crown may hold steady over the next day or two, it should again test 5.5 percent above its parity level next week. ""I don't expect much of a move higher this week, but next week the crown could again test +5.5 percent,"" said Martin Strauch, a dealer at Citibank. Jakub Perina of Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka added: ""A lot depends on London traders because they are very interested right now."" The Czech crown is fixed daily at up to plus or minus 7.5 percent of the mid-point of a basket comprising 35 percent dollars and 65 percent marks. On Wednesday, the Czech National Bank (CNB) fixed the crown at 27.712 to the dollar and 16.846 to the mark, putting the currency 5.05 percent above the mid-point. ""If the crown does not exceed its fluctuation band, the central bank will not intervene,"" CNB Spokesman Martin Svehla told the econoimc daily Hospodarske Noviny on Wednesday. Last February the CNB widened the corridor within which it fixes the crown each day to plus or minus 7.5 percent of parity, from plus/minus 0.5 percent. Since then the foreign exchange market, and not the central bank, has been much more of a force in determining the crown's rate within this controlled float. Several dealers, however, confirmed to Reuters that the CNB had contacted them on Tuesday when the crown hit 5.3 percent above parity, and said they took the move as a signal that intervention was possible whn the currency hit plus 6.0 percent. ""The market was a little spooked by this move, and the crown fell immediately,"" said one London-based analyst. ""But it regained its strength today, and I think many people now expect some intervention if it moves much higher."" CSOB's Strauch said: ""They (the CNB) could be ready to intervene at some point, possibly +6.0 percent, but it depends on whether it appears to have strength to move even higher at that point."" The main underlying reason for foreign interest in the Czech crown is the large interest rate differential between the Czech Republic and western countries. In the middle of 1996 the CNB raised the discount rate to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent and increased minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months hover around 12.5 percent. Though interbank market rates eased some 60 basis points, or 0.6 percentage points, in January, the central bank and government officials have both expressed reluctance to officially lower rates because of strong demand for money and investments. Analysts said rates are still high enough, howeer, to continue attracting large inflows of capital. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($ = 27.68 Czech Crowns) ","AlanCrosby"
"Investors in Britain's growing band of listed soccer clubs have recently experienced that sinking feeling all too familiar to long-suffering fans. Shares prices have fallen faster than a relegation-bound team as the euphoria surrounding potential earnings from sources like pay-per-view television gives way to more sober analysis. The sector has lost around 30 percent in the last six weeks or so, smaller clubs such as premier league strugglers Southampton and first division Sheffield United among the biggest losers. However, even English champions Manchester United have seen their share price fall from a January high of 737p to its current level of 630p, this despite continuing success on the pitch at home and in Europe. Share analysts who follow the financial fortunes of the clubs point out that these falls must be seen in the context of spectacular rises of 200 percent and more since early 1996. Their view is that investors are backing a winner if they stick with the big clubs but that people should think twice before putting money into clubs outside of soccer's elite. ""We believe a derating of the smaller clubs is inevitable and could be marked. These are the footballing bubbles that will fade and die,"" UBS analysts Guy Feld and Julian Easthope wrote in a recent report on what they call ""UK Football Plc"". ""In England, Premier League status will be essential, and the cost of being outside it will increase, because of the increasing concentration of TV revenues at the top end of the game,"" they added. Pay-per-view television is seen as a major benefit to only the creme de la creme of the British and European game. UBS selected a top 10 UK soccer franchises, featuring listed clubs Manchester United, Leeds United, Glasgow Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur. Two more of their tips, English premier league clubs Newcastle United and Aston Villa, will join the market shortly. Analysts expect heavy interest in both those clubs, given their strong fan base and established position among the most successful teams in the country. Analyst Nick Batram of Greig Middleton agrees that share prices of some of the smaller clubs could fall further. But he believes that clubs can make money outside the premier league, providing they do not overstretch themselves. ""They have to look at being profitable in the lower divisions rather than gambling on getting in the Premier League,"" he said. ""Millwall is unfortunately a good example of what happens when you speculate on promotion,"" he said. Second division Millwall were forced to call in the administrator in January after running up debts of 10 million pounds ($16 million). The south London club had signed players on lucrative contracts in a bid to join the 20-club premier league elite but ran into financial problems when the club went down rather than up at the end of last season.

Analysts are forecasting a surge in the Canadian currency in 1997, with some predicting the unit to rise up to 80 U.S. cents from its current 74 U.S. cent range. ""It'll take the cream off, that's for sure,"" said George Miller, president of the Mining Association of Canada. Canada is the world's largest producer of potash, uranium and zinc, the world's second biggest producer of nickel after Russia and an important source of copper. Companies that produce metal mainly in Canada are especially hit by a currency strengthening against the U.S. dollar because producers must pay their operating costs in Canadian dollars. But most companies' revenues come in U.S. dollars, the currency in which most metals trade. ""Currency gets full-time attention here,"" said Alan Thomas, chief financial officer of Noranda Inc.. A change of one U.S. cent in the Canadian dollar translates into C$20 million ($14.8 million) on Noranda's bottom line, Thomas said. The currency rose about three quarters of a U.S. cent in 1996, costing Noranda about C$15 million ($11.1 million), he said. ""So for '96, there's not a big change. But if the dollar continues to go up, it will have a bigger effect,"" he said. ""All our costs are in Canadian dollars -- the salaries we pay, the supplies we buy, the rent we pay. All our products are priced in U.S. dollars and they're priced the same regardless of the exchange rate,"" Thomas said Companies such as Alcan Aluminium Ltd., with most production outside Canada, are not as exposed to harm from a stronger currency since they pay most of their operating costs in U.S. dollars, analysts said. But for companies such as Inco Ltd. and Falconbridge Ltd. that produce most of their nickel in Canada, a stronger dollar will take its toll. Falconbridge figures a one-cent change in the Canadian dollar would knock C$7 million ($5.2 million) off its bottom line, even with the company's substantial currency hedging program. While Falconbridge operations in the Dominican Republic and Norway would not be affected by a stronger Canadian currency, about two-thirds of the company's operating costs originate in Canada, said Chief Financial Officer Lars-Eric Johansson. Inco estimated that every one-cent change in the Canadian dollar amounted to a $9 million (corrects from $13 million) pre-tax hit despite currency hedging. But the company earned $179 million in 1996 on revenues of $3.1 billion, so small movements in the Canadian dollar do not have a huge effect, said Inco Chief Financial Officer Tony Munday. ""It's not going to kill us,"" he said. Still, some mining analysts said the effects of a stronger Canadian dollar needed to be understood in context. ""With a rising dollar, it usually means metal prices are going up as well,"" said base metal analyst David Davidson with CIBC Wood Gundy in Toronto. ","HeatherScoffield"
"Talks between China and the United States on a new textile accord neared a deadline on Friday for a trans-Pacific trade war, but industry experts said they expected an agreement within hours. Chief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes held talks through Thursday night and into Friday evening with Chinese officials to try to iron out problems in renewal of a 1994 textile accord and to resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports. U.S. officials said they were hoping for an agreement before the Friday deadline expires at midnight on January 31 Eastern Standard Time, but differences over market access in China appeared to be delaying progress. Hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement, said U.S. industry representatives on the sidelines of the talks. ""We fully expect they will reach an agreement,"" said one U.S. industry representative. ""I expect the reason for the talks not wrapping up is market access,"" said National Retail Federation vice-president Robert P. Hall. ""This is an issue that is not traditionally part of apparel bilaterals."" Hayes had been upbeat about progress in the talks on Thursday, citing significant headway on the issue of market access and saying she hoped for a deal by the end of the day. However, that failed to materialise. Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the January 31 deadline, Hayes said earlier. The United States would not give China another extension of the deadline, she said. The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise. Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries. The United States has threatened multi-million dollar penalties and raised the spectre of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue. Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions. China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks. Textiles are just one of a range of issues dogging a Sino-U.S. relationship that has long been strained by disputes over topics ranging from trade to human rights to Taiwan. A U.S. delegation left Beijing on Friday after talks on human rights with Chinese officials and following a year in which all remaining members of the nation's tiny pro-democracy movement have been either imprisoned or driven into exile. U.S. trade official Lee Sands wrapped up two days of talks in Beijing on Friday to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), long a source of cross-Pacific friction. Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry. ","JaneMacartney"
"Australia's labour market watchdog is expected to award the nation's lowest-paid workers a wage rise on Tuesday in a move that is likely to have profound implications for inflation and interest rates. Financial markets are on tenterhooks as the Industrial Relations Commission prepares to arbitrate in an old-style showdown between the trade union movement and employers. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has asked for a wage rise of A$20 (US15.50) per week for the lowest paid, as well as rises in minimum rates of pay of up to 8.75 percent. Employers oppose it, saying it will harm the economy. The central bank has also expressed concern at the ACTU's so-called ""living wage"" claim, which seeks to help workers left behind in Australia's move away from centrally-fixed wages toward individual deals hammered out on the factory floor. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) estimates the claim, if granted in full, would swell the nation's total wages bill by 1.6 percent, taking the rate of wages growth to about 5.5 percent, well above the bank's comfort zone of 4.0-4.5 percent. Employers go further, saying Australia's jobless rate would jump sharply higher as industry adjusted to the higher labour costs by shedding staff. ""If the ACTU claim were granted, unemployment would race past a million, inflation would rise well above its current level, interest rates would lift and investment growth would come to an immediate halt,"" a peak employer group has warned. Australia's jobless rate was at 8.7 percent in March, and has been stuck at or above 8.5 percent since early 1995. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said it believes the ACTU's claim would increase the national wages bill by more like 4.8 percent, based on an industry survey showing more workers were covered by the claim than commonly thought. Financial markets are also jumpy, with inflation data for the March quarter to be released on Wednesday, the day after the commission's decision is handed down. ""You never know which way they (the commission) are going to jump. It's a fairly big week...,"" National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster told Reuters on Monday. Market economists are tipping 2.1 percent underlying inflation for the year to March, comfortably within the RBA's target range of two to three percent. Economists predict the commission will hand down a compromise on Tuesday, leaving minimum rates of pay alone and granting a wage rise of between A$10 and A$15 per week. This would exceed the government's position, which is to support a rise of A$8 per week for the lowest paid, but would not move the RBA to lift interest rates sooner than expected, they said. Rates are currently tipped to rise late in 1997. (A$1 = US$0.77) ","MarkBendeich"
"A Sino-French group has submitted a proposal to build a new cocoa processing factory in Ivory Coast to supply Chinese chocolate manufacturers, an Ivorian government spokesmen said on Thursday. ""It is a completely new plan which the government will study this week to clarify its position on financial support,"" said Philippe Mian, cabinet technical advisor to Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan. ""The idea is still only a proposal."" Managers from French cocoa firm Touton S.A. and Chinese chocolate factory owner Shanghai Collin met Duncan last week to discuss investing 12 billion CFA in the new factory, he said. Details were still under wraps but a new company called Societe Ivoirienne de Cacao (SICAO) would be set up if given the green light and enough government support, Mian added. Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, wants to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa production locally by the year 2000 to add more value and remove from export sale lower grades of cocoa. Ivory Coast's inward investment arm CEPICI (Centre de Promotion des Investissements en Cote d'Ivoire) said the sponsors of the project had proposed an initial investment of eight billion CFA, rising to 12 billion CFA over about two years. ""They are looking for a site around Vridi (Abidjan port),"" said CEPICI director Michel Koffivi. ""We cannot say what the processing capacity will be at this stage,"" he added. Plant construction could begin as early as September. Touton managing director Patrick De Boussac declined earlier this week to clarify factory plans after last week's visit to Ivory Coast by co-director Alexandre Turincev and Shanghai Collin's president Foo Sam. ""I have no comment,"" he said by telephone from Bordeaux. Formal factory proposals have already been submitted by three other investors looking at processing in Ivory Coast. An Ivorian-Chinese-French group under the name STF-CI had submitted proposal for a plant to process 15-25,000 tonnes of beans a year, Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze told Reuters last month. That plant also aims to supply promising Chinese markets with semi-processed products. Ivorian exporter SICC and U.S.-based commodities giant Cargill recently opened talks over a 50,000-tonne capacity factory but sources close to discussions said a final decision was unlikely within the next three months. French Perpignan-based confectioner Cantalou, which makes CEMOI brands, has submitted proposals for a factory with a capacity of 60,000 tonnes of beans a year but would not give details until later this year, a Cantalou spokesman said. Ivory Coast is urging processors to use lower grade mid-crop (April-Sept) cocoa beans after constant complaints from buyers that sub-grade beans were being mixed in with beans for export. Gauze said in early March that Ivory Coast aimed to process 300,000 tonnes of its 1996/97 crop. ""Capacity is currently 200,000 tonnes but we are working on increasing this,"" he told Reuters at the sidelines of an International Cocoa Association in London. Ivory Coast produced a record 1.2 million tonnes of cocoa in 1995/96 and originally predicted 950,000 tonnes for this year before Gauze said in March only 800,000 would be exported -- partly due to increased local processing. Four factories with a (bean) capacity rising to 180,000 tonnes in late 1997 are already operating in Ivory Coast. Industry sources say over 130,000 tonnes of beans could be processed this year if factories operated normally. New processing capacity was unlikely to be on line in 1997, taking into account application processing time and a minimum of six months to build a basic factory, one said. Private forecasters have put Ivory Coast's 1996/97 crop at up to 1.1 million tonnes. ($1=567 CFA francs) -- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"The Czech government expects the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to grow 5.4 percent in 1997 after an expected 5.1 percent this year, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Wednesday. Speaking after a cabinet session discussing the 1997 budget proposal, Klaus said the new budget was based on an annual average inflation forecast of 8.6 percent for next year, down from a revised forecast of 9.0 in 1996. The prime minister said the country's current account deficit could reach 5.8 percent of GDP in 1997, after a projected 5.7 percent this year. The current account gap, caused by a balloning trade deficit, is expected to climb to about 150 billion crowns ($5.69 billion) this year from 96 billion in 1995. ""We expect that we will not yet turn around the trade deficit, nor the deficit of the current account,"" Klaus said. He said the budget, which will go to the cabinet next week for final approval before going to parliament, was planned as his government's fifth straight balanced budget, with spending and revenues standing at 549.1 billion crowns. The cabinet would propose cutting personal income taxes by raising the threshold for taxable income to 28,800 crowns from the current 26,400, and by widening the tax brackets for individuals. Corporate tax should remain unchanged at 39 percent. ""The cabinet did not find more room (for tax cuts) other than the possibility to cut taxes in the level of about 2.8 billion crowns,"" Klaus told the news conference. Klaus and his centre-right coalition partners made lowering taxes one of the cornerstones of their political programmes prior to June's parliamentary elections, in which they lost a majority in the lower house of the parliament. Klaus said government consumption should show a relative decline when the growth of the economy was factored in, while household consumption should rise four percent and creation of fixed capital by 13 percent. ""That is a continuation of the fast investment wave, which is going on in this economy, which is the condition and guarantee of its positive development and export ability.""

"Food and drink group Grand Metropolitan Plc said on Thursday it was hanging a ""for sale"" sign on its national food businesess in Europe in an effort to focus on its major international brands -- Pillsbury, Green Giant, Haagen-Dazs and Old El Paso. ""We have people indicating strong interest and indicating prices that are acceptable to us,"" said Paul Walsh, chief executive of GrandMet's Pillsbury Company in an interview. He said he expected the sell-off to be complete by January 1997. In the shop window in Britain are Shippams, meat pie maker Peter's Savoury Products, Memory Lane Cakes and Fleur de Lys. Also on the block are Germany's Hofmann-Menu and Goldstein, cake and pastry maker Brossard in France and Italy, waffle maker Suzy and biscuit firm Desobry in Belgium and cake maker Driehoek in the Netherlands. Analysts expect them to fetch about 140 million pounds ($220 million). Their combined sales last year were 370 million pounds with operating profit of 10 million and operating capital used of 129 million pounds at September 30, 1995. Before the announcement, GrandMet's European foods business showed sales of $1.2 billion, which are forecast to fall to about $450 million once they are sold. The European foods business posted a trading profit of 23 million pounds in the year to September 1995, up from 12 million in 1994, after a hefty restructuring and plant closure programme undertaken in 1993. The company does not disclose earnings for each individual subsidiary but Brossard in France is easily the largest and similar in sales terms to Germany's Erasco Group, which Campbell Soup agreed earlier to buy from GrandMet for about $210 million. ""My plan in foods is to focus on our leading brands,"" said Walsh, adding that the sell-off of so-called tertiary brands would allow GrandMet to concentrate on its main brands. The businesses were also providing an inadequate return on capital, he said. ""You can expect GrandMet to be very eager to improve total return to shareholders. Several of us have held this view for a long while. ""I think it's compatible with GrandMet's mission to improve shareholder returns. We intend to fix that.""

"International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings that were slightly better than expected, bolstered by its service business, growth in software sales and tight expense controls. The world's largest computer maker said net income rose 17.6 percent to $2.0 billion in the quarter from $1.7 billion in the year-ago period. Earnings per share rose faster, to $3.93 from $3.09 a share, since IBM had 7 percent fewer shares outstanding in the quarter due to stock buybacks. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of $3.88 a share, on average, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates. While analysts and investors said the results looked good, some said IBM stock might come under profit-taking pressure on Wednesday. ""It's an excellent number, it's an excellent quarter. You really can't say anything bad about it. But I think it may cause a brief period of selling because Wall Street (sells) on that kind of news,"" said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood. ""They were mixed results, software and services were great"" and European results were encouraging, said David Takata, a Gruntal &amp; Co. analyst. But Takata said weak mainframe computer revenues were disappointing. Some analysts had been predicting mainframe revenues rose in the quarter due to strong new products. The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer maker said service revenues jumped 22 percent in the fourth quarter and personal computer sales rose, but sales of mainframes fell. Software revenues grew 4 percent in the quarter, and hardware sales grew 2 percent. Revenues overall rose 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion. Expenses fell 2 percent in the quarter from the 1995 period, IBM said. ""We showed good growth in the fourth quarter despite a difficult year-over-year comparison, continued weakness in Europe and a greater-than-expected currency impact,"" IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner said in a statement. Currency fluctuations cut revenues by about 3 percentage points in the quarter, compared with about a two point positive impact in the 1995 quarter, IBM said. Net earnings for the year rose to $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share, from $4.2 billion, or $7.23 a share, in 1995. The 1996 results included a charge for research and development from the acquisition of Lotus Development Corp. Full-year revenues rose 5.6 percent to $75.95 billion from $71.94 billion. In a break with tradition, IBM released its results after the stock market closed rather than before the market opened. Analysts said there was no particular significance to IBM reporting after the close. IBM was trying to avoid the drastic swings in its stock that have come during a conference call with analysts it hosts after the earnings are released. The stock closed up $1 at $168 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ","TheresePoletti"
"China named on Thursday four more foreign banks approved to handle local currency business, and bankers said they saw the accelerated timetable reflecting a desire to boost property prices in Shanghai's Pudong zone. The China Daily said the four new banks were U.K.-based Standard Chartered Bank, Japan's Sanwa Bank and Daiichi Kangyo Bank and the Shanghai-Paris International Bank, a joint venture between France's Banque National de Paris and the Industrial and Commerical Bank of China. The newspaper said the banks, and four others named earlier, would be able to take deposits and make loans in yuan, the Chinese currency, only after they had moved operations to the Pudong district of Shanghai. ""I see the whole thing as being real-estate driven,"" said a foreign banker. ""To make Pudong a success, they need to get the foreigners over there, so there's no reason limiting the numbers."" The Chinese authorities want to make the Pudong development zone in eastern Shanghai the country's premier financial district, and have told foreign banks they will only be allowed to do local currency business from offices there. ""Before the banks were approved no one would touch Pudong, but now people are charging over there to try and sign something up,"" said a real estate broker. Foreign bankers had originally assumed the authorities would wait until the first four banks had begun operations before approving any more. The first four are Citicorp's Citibank unit, HSBC Corp's Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp unit, the Industrial Bank of Japan and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd Chinese banking sources said a number of other banks would also be approved for yuan business during 1997. Foreign bankers said the faster they were allowed into the yuan business the better, regardless of the limitations placed upon them. Approved banks can only accept Chinese yuan deposits from foreign-funded firms or from foreign individuals, or deposits from Chinese enterprises derived from the banks' loans to them. The banks can supply yuan loans only to foreign-funded firms or Chinese enterprises who have previously obtained foreign currency loans from the banks. ""We won't be able to increase our customer base, but it's at least a start, another step forward,"" said a foreign banker. ""It's a very significant step,"" said a senior banker with one of the chosen banks. ""If a bank can't do business in the local currency then it's only half a bank."" ""We welcome this good news,"" said Lance Browne, Standard Chartered's chief executive for China. ""It's a positive development for our business in China."" Another banker said specific regulations for the business had not yet been issued by the central bank, and training sessions for foreign bank staff were in progress nearly every weekend. One banker said he did not expect yuan loans and deposits to begin for another three or four months, to allow all the various issues to be sorted out. ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"Microsoft Corp.'s 4-month-old Expedia Internet travel service sold more than $1 million in travel tickets this week, its best ever, executives said Friday. Josh Herst, lead product manager for Expedia, said business has been building but enjoyed a flurry of sales this week when American Airlines launched a fare war after President Clinton blocked a strike by its pilots. ""We had a nice spike,"" he said. ""If they wanted to have more of those, we wouldn't complain."" Herst said Microsoft is investing heavily in the travel arena, seen as a potentially lucrative form of electronic commerce. Forrester Research analyst Bill Bass said travel generated $126 million in retail sales over the Internet in 1996, second only to computer software and hardware, which generated $140 million. By 2000, the travel industry will generate $1.6 billion in annual sales over the Internet, Forrester estimates. ""Airline tickets are a great thing to be able to buy online,"" Bass said. ""You don't have to hold it -- it's not like clothes, where it helps to be able to see it and touch it."" Bass also said travel sites on the Internet are able to include related information such as maps and hotel listings that would be impossible to provide over the telephone. Microsoft is far from the only company seeking a piece of the Internet travel market, but analysts give Expedia high marks so far and say Microsoft is likely to remain one of the major players. Other online travel agencies include Travelocity, operated by American Airlines' parent company AMR Corp., Preview Travel and Internet Travel Network. Airlines themselves also operate sites, which have proven to be an excellent way to sell seats that would otherwise go empty, Bass said. American Airlines has sold $10 million in tickets in the past year through a weekly electronic mail bulletin offering discount seats for weekend travel on lightly booked flights, he said. Herst said Microsoft has about 100 people working on Expedia, including journalists building a database of information about destinations. The service plans to add several ""big-name columnists"" soon, said Erik Blachford, Expedia product manager. Microsoft is believed to keep slightly less than the usual 10 percent travel agent's commission, and it has a relationship with Worldspan Travel Partners in Atlanta to print and mail tickets and provide 24-hour telephone support for travelers. Microsoft also expects to generate substantial advertising revenue, Herst said. While Expedia is designed for individuals and small businesses, Microsoft also is working with American Express Co. on a related project to develop a corporate travel application.

"The Czech Republic appeared headed for its first budget deficit despite earlier reports by the fiscally-hawkish government that it had achieved a surplus for the fourth successive year. ""(We expect) the definitive results for 1996 will range around a deficit of 1.7 billion crowns,"" Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said on Wednesday in testimony to parliament's budget committtee. The Czechs have had three surplus budgets since Czechoslovakia split in 1993. Final data were due in the ministry on Wednesday but as local media paid close attention to whether monetarist Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus would maintain his fiscal winning streak, Havel said the trend was not positive. He said that by Wednesday revenues totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.5 billion. More bills may be delivered after the deadline, inflating expenditures further, Havel said. The government made last-ditch efforts in December when the budget looked headed for a more than five billion crown deficit, by freezing some outlays until 1997, and requiring early repayment on credit granted to a deposit insurance fund. The budget has been hampered by lower-than-expected tax revenue and delayed repayment on credits to Russia. The 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of spending cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns. Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome, but he was concerned with the effects government payment adjustments may have on the 1997 budget. Part of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which was due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s. Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the ""alpha and omega"" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus, made by the finance ministry soon after the new year, as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility. Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997. But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996. Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"At least two bombs rocked the western Chinese city of Urumqi on Tuesday, killing one person and injuring at least 60, officials and residents said. The blasts, on the day that China held memorial rites for its late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, occurred on city buses in at least two separate incidents in the capital of the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang at about 6.30 p.m. (1030 GMT). Deng died last Wednesday aged 92 and Tuesday was the final of six days of mourning for him. ""At least 60 people were killed or injured,"" a local government official, who declined to be further identified, said. He did not say how many were killed. But a resident of the city said a trishaw driver was killed in one incident when a passenger in a bus found a bomb under a seat and threw it out of the window. The number of injuries from that explosion was not known. There were conflicting reports of a third bomb. A police officer at a centre handling the incidents declined to give further details, saying only: ""The situation is very tense."" An official at the Military Region General Hospital in Urumqi, capital of the restive western region of Xinjiang, said at least 37 injured had been admitted after the bomb blasts. She gave no further details. At another hospital in Urumqi, an official said two people who had been slightly injured had been treated and released. A woman working at a hotel near one explosion said the blast ripped apart a bus and sent bits of metal flying through the air. Police arrived shortly afterwards and cordoned off the area. Soldiers on trucks were later brought into the city, she said. One explosion occurred on Northwest Road, involving a vehicle believed to be a minibus, a worker at a nearby hotel said. Asked if anyone was killed, the worker said: ""What do you think? With many people on the bus the chance is very high."" Nearby residents contacted by telephone said traffic was snarled along the road for about one hour and that people were being advised to avoid the area. The explosions were believed to involve time-bombs, possibly set by members of the ethnic Uighur minority, officials said. ""We suspect that these incidents involve splittist elements,"" said one official, referring to pro-indepenence activists among Xinjiang's native Uighur population. ""These people want to disrupt the atmosphere during the memorial ceremonies for comrade Deng Xiaoping,"" said another official, referring to final rites held in Beijing on Tuesday morning for China's late paramount leader. No arrests had yet been made, officials said. ""People have been warned not to go outside,"" one resident said. It was the first violence reported in Xinjiang since anti-Chinese riots in the far western region's town of Yining on February 5 and 6 left nine people dead and 198 injured. Chinese police arrested up to 300 people after that riot in Xinjiang -- a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan -- but many have been released after interrogation. About 1,000 people, mostly Uighur farmers or unemployed young men, rioted in Yining in one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in Xinjiang -- which means New Frontier in Chinese -- since the communist takeover in 1949. Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.

"A South Korean official on Tuesday said progress had been made in talks with China over the fate of the most senior leader to flee Pyongyang but terms of his departure from Beijing were still undecided. Hwang Jang-yop, a senior North Korean ideologue and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il, has been stranded in Seoul's mission in Beijing since February 12 while the three nations negotiate his fate. ""There has been some headway. Negotiations are still going on,"" said Chang Moon-ik, spokesman for the South Korean embassy in Beijing. Officials in South Korea said on Monday they expected a breakthrough this week in talks with China aimed at securing Hwang's passage out of Beijing but Chang said it was unlikely he would be moved in the next few days. ""Final arrangements have yet to be done first. There has been no final decision,"" Chang said by telephone. Weeks of talks over Hwang's fate, interrupted by the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month, have failed to produce an accord as Beijing finds itself torn between an old communist ally and a new capitalist friend. ""We want to bring Mr Hwang to Seoul directly but if that is not possible we can make other arrangements,"" Chang said. Korean sources have said Hwang may be whisked away to another country, possibly in Southeast Asia. Analysts say Hwang will likely end up in Seoul but Beijing is anxious to help North Korea save face by being seen to give due consideration to the hermit nation's concerns. Hwang, chief architect of Pyongyang's ruling ideology of Juche, or self-reliance, is the highest North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state. His defection has placed extra strains on ties between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 civil war ended in an uneasy ceasefire. Armed Chinese police backed by armoured personnel carriers and a crowd control truck maintained a tight security cordon around Seoul's consular compound where Hwang is holed up in Beijing's normally sedate diplomatic quarter. Beijing has appealed to North and South Korea to stay calm during attempts to end the diplomatic standoff sparked by Hwang's defection. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last week Beijing was still investigating Hwang's case and hoped for a solution as soon as possible. North Korea initially accused the South of kidnapping Hwang, then changed its hardline stance by saying if he really had defected he was a traitor and would be dismissed. Beijing, which sent its armies to fight on Pyongyang's side during the Korean War, established diplomatic links with Seoul only in 1992. ","ScottHillis"

""I felt like it was important to extend it, the deadline, for one day... so we could get a fresh start this morning,"" Hayes said before resuming the eleventh-hour talks. ""We did not complete the agreement... so we felt like we'd have one extra day to complete it,"" she said. ""We didn't finish last night so we are re-evaluating where we are and will continue negotiations this morning."" U.S. officials said they hoped for a deal by the end of Saturday. Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions. China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks. Hayes said the U.S. side was still focusing on two major demands -- its market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry. ""The two main things that we have been consistently concerned about are the market access that China has to the United States... and also making sure that it is balanced, that we have a market access package from China,"" she said. Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier. However, they said hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement. ""I expect the reason for the talks not wrapping up is market access,"" said National Retail Federation vice-president Robert P. Hall said on Friday. ""This is an issue that is not traditionally part of apparel bilaterals."" Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the previous deadline of January 31, Hayes has said. Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries. ","ScottHillis"
"The Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate Friday posted profits of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) for the second year running -- but warned that profits would fall for at least the next two years. The insurance market, which last year only just succeeded in pushing through a rescue package after the billions of pounds of losses run up between 198nd 1992, also said its future focus would be on customers. ""For too long, Lloyd's has been obsessed with its capital base. We need to get back to basics,"" said Chief Executive Ron Sandler. That meant providing customers with the best service and developing international trading opportunities, he said. Lloyd's results are reported three years in arrears, and for 1994 profits once again topped the billion-pound mark at 1.01 billion pounds ($1.6 billion). That fell just short of 1993's record level of 1.08 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) and was in line with forecasts. Corporate members, who were introduced to the market in 1994 following the near-disastrous losses which threatened to sink Lloyd's, will share in the profits for the first time. Corporate capital now provides some 44 percent of the market's capacity, a figure that is forecast to increase further in the future. Sandler described the 1994 results as ""extremely satisfactory"" but said there was no sign of an end to the downward trend in premium rates. That decline, a product of competition in insurance markets worldwide, is expected to have a significant impact on profits in the next few years. An aggregate of individual syndicate forecasts suggests profits will fall to around 900 million pounds in 1995 ($1.5 billion) and 600 million ($980 million) in 1996. The 1995 figure is ahead of projections made this time last year despite the adverse movement in currencies, but the slide in rates is expected to take its toll in subsequent years. Lloyd's chairman, Sir David Rowland, admitted 1997 results would be under pressure from the decline and said he hoped brokers would ""sit on their hands when offered business at crazy rates."" The 1994 figures were a result of generally good market conditions and the exercise of much-sharpened skills in pricing and the setting of terms by Lloyd's underwriters, he said. They were also helped because of fewer catastrophes, he added, though currency effects reduced profits by around 100 million pounds ($164 million). Lloyd's returned to profit 12 months ago following five years of record losses totalling more than 8 billion pounds ($13 billion). Those losses were reinsured into a separate company, Equitas, a central plank in Lloyd's ""reconstruction and renewal"" plan which ensured the 300-year old insurance market's survival. The reinsurance of 1992 and prior liabilities have transformed Lloyd's position, Sandler said, and clients could be confident that Lloyd's security ranked alongside the best in the world.

"BOGOTA, April 23 Reuter - Colombia will draw heavily on its coffee stockpiles to meet export commitments, given that the 1996/97 harvest seems set to come in lower than previous estimates of 10.4 million 60-kg bags, the country's coffee czar Jorge Cardenas said this week. Many private exporters and independent analysts, however, believe that much of the powerful National Coffee Growers' Federation's stocks are old crop or even beans that have been damaged by the so-called ""broca"" or berry borer - thereby making much of it unfit for export. Gloomy harvest predictions by federation head Cardenas coincided with a report in Colombia's leading political magazine Semana that said serious underlying structural problems were the prime cause behind falling production levels. In an impromptu press conference after the weekly federation meeting Monday, Cardenas said the 1996/97 harvest would come in at little over 10 million 60-kg bags. He predicted coffee inventories would drop to 3.5 million bags from current levels of about five million bags by the end of September this year as Colombia sought to meet export schedules. He declined to comment on independent sources' claims that much of the stocks were old. Quoting a range of experts, Semana magazine said the gradual fall in coffee output was due to the progressive aging of coffee plantations or because growers were abandoning them altogether. A separate report in the respected El Espectador daily newspaper cited National Statistics Department figures saying that the dismal 0.21 percent growth rate of the agricultural sector in 1996 was largely due to the poor performance of coffee, with an 18.5 percent drop in production. Also at Monday's federation meeting, the organization's technical director Antonio Herron, warned that ""broca"" was continuing to spread and could affect all Colombia's 900,000 hectares of coffee by 1999. At present about 680,000 hectares are affected by broca, about 75 percent of the country's plantations. Federation officials previously said growers were managing to keep broca in check thanks to a vigorous TV advertising campaign. Growers themselves complain that the fight against broca has pushed up production costs. The federation estimates that about five percent of the 1996/97 coffee crop will be damaged by broca -- a little more than 500,000 60-kg sacks -- further forcing down the amount of excelso coffee available for export. The prevailing gloom was partially lifted by predictions by U.S. brokerage Merrill Lynch that international coffee prices could stay high until September. Cardenas predicted July-September coffee prices would rise to somewhere around current spot May levels because of continuing supply jitters in the international markets. A second bright point came at the end of last week with the negotiated end to a five-day truck drivers' strike, which Cardenas said had done ""a lot of damage to coffee flows"" and delayed shipment of 200,000 70-kg bags.

"Canada's largest stock market in Toronto posted its biggest intra-day drop in almost a decade on Thursday as shares in former market darling Bre-X Minerals Ltd. were hammered by investors. The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index plummeted 191.21 points to 5931.63, the biggest loss since October 20, 1987, the day after so-called Black Monday when it lost 220.90 points. Gold prospector Bre-X resumed trading late on Thursday, plunging C$13 to C$2.50 on eight million shares after the company said on Wednesday's its Busang gold find, once touted as the world's largest, may not be as rich as projected. ""It's pretty obvious that Bre-X blew a hole in the market,"" said John Ing president of Maison Placements Canada of Toronto. ""It's...the shock and the ripple effect of the Bre-X disaster."" Investors unloaded their Bre-X shares after trading resumed Thursday afternoon, wiping C$3.12 billion ($2.26 million) from the company's market value. The stock was halted on Wednesday. On Nasdaq, Bre-X shares plummeted $9-13/32 to $1-31/32 on trading of nearly 6.9 million shares. Investors seemed unconvinced after Bre-X chief executive David Walsh declared he was confident of the company's reserve estimates for its discovery deep in Indonesia's jungle. Bre-X's partner Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. said on Wednesday its preliminary studies showed the site turned up ""insignificant amounts of gold."" Bre-X has estimated the Busang deposit contains 71 million ounces of gold. During the selloff, the Toronto Stock Exchange's computer systems were halted twice, forcing the market to close half an hour early due to ""technical difficulties,"" an official said. Worries about other junior mining firms swept the market, sparking a massive retreat in the heavyweight gold sector. The gold group sank 906.93 points, or 8.66 percent, to close at 9559.92 -- its biggest one-day drop since September 7, 1993 when the sector lost nearly 10 percent of its value. The carnage also extended to New York's stock market, which lost 140.11 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close two percent lower at 6740.59. Wall Street, already unsettled by fears that rising interest rates would end its bull run, was further hurt by news that Toronto was suffering its own difficulties with Bre-X, analysts said. All of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes finished lower, led by golds, banks and base metals. Trading was heavy with 104.2 million shares changing hands worth C$1.38 billion ($1.0 billion). Declining issues outnumbered advances 787 to 214 with 270 stocks were unchanged. ","LydiaZajc"
"Kmart Corp., in another bid to spruce up its discount stores, said Wednesday it will spend $750 million over the next three years to convert nearly all of the outlets to a new concept called ""Big Kmart."" The new Big Kmarts are designed to help shoppers save time and money and bring them back more often by reorganizing merchandise and displaying it in wider, easier-to-access aisles. ""This new store signals real change, a new beginning, a new Kmart, bigger and better in every respect,"" Chairman Floyd Hall said at an unveiling of the Big Kmart concept at the Chicago Brickyard Mall. The Big Kmart concept is expected to add significantly to sales at existing stores. ""We would look for a 20 percent gain in any given store in sales per square foot,"" Hall said in an interview. The Big Kmart prototypes, under development for 18 months, have previously been called Kmart's ""high frequency"" concept. So far 297 stores have been converted. Another 333 are slated for conversion in 1997. Most of the remainder of Kmart's more than 2,000 traditional stores will be converted by 1999. Big Kmart stores, not to be confused with another concept, the Super Kmart Centre, are the same size as the 60,000 to 80,000 square feet traditional stores. The Big Kmart concept groups merchandise into three areas: home fashions, including towels, bedding, dinnerware and appliances, located near the front of the store; childrens' apparel and toys, near ladies and mens apparel; and consumables, including health and beauty care products, near the centre of the store. Big Kmart stores will also feature a new Pantry department filled with more food and household products, paper products and pet supplies. ""We don't really look for a customer to choose us over a grocery store,"" Hall said. ""We're offering it up as a convenience to our customers."" The Big Kmart stores will not duplicate the full grocery sections offered in the firm's 97 Super Kmart Centres. Kmart, the nation's third largest retailer, has launched previous programmes to draw shoppers into its discount stores, which have been criticised as dirty and disorganized. In 1990, former Kmart chairman Joseph Antonini launched a massive store renovation programme that also updated the company's logo. However, the changes failed to bring Kmart up to the standards set by archrivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target. Hall said the company plans to open seven traditional stores and three Super Kmart Centres in 1997 and concentrate its efforts on opening 35 new Big Kmart stores and 15 to 18 Super Kmart Centres in 1998.

"Regional Baby Bell phone companies appear to have triumphed over their long-distance rivals in a crucial regulatory battle that would leave some customers paying less and others more for their monthly bill. The Federal Communications Commission has decided against ordering a precipitous cut in the $23 billion long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp. pay the Bells each year for access to the local phone network, said FCC and industry officials. Bell executives at one point feared such cuts could cost their companies as much as $10 billion in revenues. Consumer groups and long-distance companies advocate immediate cuts in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, saying that would mean a similar cut in long-distance rates. ""The Bells have dodged a bullet,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group. ""They may get grazed. But they dodged a bullet that was aimed at them during the last six months."" Instead of a big FCC-imposed cut, the agency plans to rely on competition to lower access charges over time, said FCC and industry officials. That could mean an FCC-imposed loss of Bell revenues of no more than $1 billion the first year. Less clear was the impact on phone customers. Those who make lots of long-distance calls would see a sizeable drop in their bills, said FCC officials. But wireless phone subscribers could pay anywhere from 1 percent to 2 percent more a month through new fees. Customers with more than one phone line for a computer or the kids and who make few long-distance calls would see a monthly rate rise of around $1 or more. ""We're cutting away the frills,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview. ""We're talking about a $1 subsidy per month that we're eliminating for somebody who's connecting a $2,500 computer to that line and purchasing $20 a month of unlimited access,"" said Hunt, a big advocate of the rules under consideration. They are set to be voted on next week. Details may change. FCC officials, meanwhile, say the plan would yield a cut in long-distance charges of more than $1 billion in the first year. FCC officials oppose a steep cut for several reasons. Citing rate hikes by AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp. late last year, they fear long-distance carriers may not fully pass on a major reduction to consumers and pocket some of the money. Long-distance executives vow to pass on the reductions. FCC officials also fear a sharp cut would unleash a rise in local phone rates by carriers trying to recoup lost money. ""We're keeping basic residential dial tone at today's price,"" said Hundt. Critics charge the plan would mean higher rates. AT&amp;T says long-distance customers will see a $1.5 billion jump at the outset in July. ""Regulators appear unlikely to squeeze the fat out of the Bells' prices, leaving consumers paying for inflated rates,"" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union. But Hundt says that over the next five years at least $10 billion ""will be transferred to consumers"" via access cuts. The plan also would pay for $3 billion to connect schools, libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet and provide cheap phone service for the poor. Access charges were created after the 1984 breakup of Ma Bell. Experts agree the $23 billion is more than the cost of providing local access. But they cannot agree on the amount. FCC officials said 85 percent of the nation's 80 million residential phone customers would see a lower monthly bill. Those who make lots of long-distance calls would benefit the most, because the agency plans to replace some of the existing per-minute access charges with a monthly flat rate. The 15 percent of residents who do not make long-distance calls would see their bills stay the same. But customers with more than one line and who make few long-distance calls are likely to see a rate rise. That's because the ceiling, or cap, on the existing ""subscriber line charge"" is expected to rise to $5 a month from $3.50 for each additional residential line, and to roughly $7 a line for multi-line business customers from $6. One possible way around the charge may be for customers to list their additional lines in a different name or use another local carrier, said industry officials. ","RogerFillion"
"Bell Atlantic Corp. said Thursday its earnings rose sharply in the first quarter, boosted by growth in its telephone and cellular businesses. The Philadelphia-based telecommunications company reported first-quarter net income of $515.6 million, an increase of 11.0 percent over the $464.7 million it earned in first quarter of 1996. Earnings per share rose to $1.17 from $1.06, slightly more than the First Call consensus estimate of $1.16. Operating revenues grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion. ""This was a good solid set of numbers,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Simon Flannery said of the strong showing in new and second-line growth, wireless business and productivity. ""In spite of investments for new initiatives, they were still able to deliver double-digit earnings growth in the latest quarter,"" he said. Bell Atlantic Chairman and Chief Executive Raymond Smith said, ""Demand for our services, including data connectivity, wireless and value-added services, continues to drive excellent bottom line performance."" Anticipating a landmark year for the company, Smith said, ""We are heading toward the closing of our merger with Nynex with great momentum. With solid fundamentals, we are poised for a terrific year in 1997."" The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Bell Atlantic and Nynex Corp. are stepping preparations for a legal counter-attack if the Justice Department blocks their proposed $23 billion merger, which was announced in April 1996. Smith said the company has been able to absorb significant start-up costs for new ventures, such as the PrimeCo personal communications services partnership and international wireless activities. The chief factors in the latest results were continued cost-control measures and the strong performance of Bell Atlantic's core business units, driven by revenue growth of 7.6 percent, including Bell Atlantic's proportionate share of domestic cellular revenues. The year-ago results excluded a non-cash $142.1 million charge the comnpany took to cover a change in the method for booking revenues from its directory publishing business in 1996. After the restatement, first-quarter 1996 net income was $606.8 million, but investors focused on the company's actual operating results. Bell Atlantic's stock gained $1 to $60.25 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The latest earnings report consolidates the results of the Mexican Grupo Iusacell SA de CV investment for the first time following Bell Atlantic's assumption of operational control of the business in February. Specific figures were not broken out in the company's statement. ","EricAuchard"
"Australia's biggest retailer Coles Myer Ltd on Thursday reported a 41-percent surge in half-year earnings, its first profit rise in almost two years. The result buoyed Coles' once-sinking share price, which rose despite a weaker market, and followed a two-year nightmare of sliding profits, shareholder anger and consumer thrift. Coles, which pockets about 18 cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, reported a net profit of A$273.6 million (US$217 million) for the half-year ended January 26, compared with A$194.5 million a year ago. Before abnormals, net earnings leapt 23 percent to a better-than-expected A$229 million, boosting the shares 13 cents above Wednesday's close to a high of A$6.04 before easing back. ""We see this as a very good first step on a road to recovery,"" chief executive Dennis Eck told reporters. Coles' performance has now recovered to the levels of its year ended July 1995, one of its most profitable ever, he added. Coles gave a bullish forecast for 1996/97 annual profit, predicting more strong profit growth in the second half-year and looking forward to a quieter time in the nation's newspapers. Coles is rising from the ashes of poor management and board turmoil. In late 1995, a controversy surrounding Coles' largest shareholder and then chairman, Solomon Lew, erupted in the nation's media. At one point, media baron Rupert Murdoch accused Lew of thuggery and trying to stifle newspaper coverage. The row focused on a transaction that cost Coles A$18 million and benefitted a company associated with Lew by a similar sum. Lew denied any impropriety but stepped down as chairman in 1995 in the first of several board shake-ups. Coles managing director Peter Bartels quit in December, handing the reins over to Eck who appeared on Thursday to be relieved Coles was no longer in the headlines. ""For a couple of months, our staff was quite happy to see us out of the press,"" Eck said. Retail analysts are tipping Coles to report annual net profit of around A$310 million in 1996/97. One analyst said profit forecasts for Coles might now edge a little higher, but improving sentiment was mainly behind the firmer share price. ""I think the retail market is picking up, but it's still tough out there,"" the Melbourne-based analyst said. The half-year results highlighted Coles success in improving profit margins. The 23 percent rise in pre-abnormal profit was struck on a 5.4 percent increase in sales to A$9.945 billion. ""What is important are people's expectations of the turnaround now. I think that's why the stock is where it is, on anticipation of much better margins and profit,"" a broker said. Coles is not the only big retailer to weather tough trading conditions and investor scepticism. Upmarket retailer and rival David Jones Ltd is now feeling the heat. Its chief executive resigned this week on the eve of the company reporting a 50 percent dive in half-year net earnings. (A$1 = US$0.79) ","MarkBendeich"

"Russia's Gazprom, the world's largest gas company and a corporate empire with the power of a state, has not seen big economic troubles at home hurt its ability to raise money abroad. Energy analysts, speaking on Friday one day before RAO Gazprom holds its annual shareholders' meeting, said Russia's arguably most powerful company would use the event to declare an end to a tussle with the government over the company's role in the economy and to solidify investor confidence. ""Nonpayments problems depress Gazprom's collection rate and undermine its overall profitability,"" said analyst Yuri Butayev of Renaissance Capital. ""But the company is attractive, regardless,"" he said, citing its huge reserves and exports to Europe. ""It's absolutely unique."" Gazprom, struggling to emerge from a severe nonpayments crisis which has left most Russian enterprises crippled, goes into the meeting on the heels of major capital raising plans and a clean slate before tax authorities. The company faces a major problem in getting domestic customers to pay. But some analysts said the problem had still not dented the company's fundamentals and cash flows from exports were strong. ""It's raised more capital abroad than any other Russian company,"" said energy analyst Ivan Mazalov of CentreInvest Group consultancy in Moscow, adding Gazprom's reserves and exports were the company's top positive factors. ""Foreign credit institutions are very confident of Gazprom's ability to repay."" The monopoly is a corporate and political force in Russia, where it accounted for a vast 26 percent of the country's 1996 tax revenues and heats a nation of voters. But Gazprom, once a ministry and once run by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, faced attacks earlier this year by cabinet officials, who were once the company's unquestioning supporters but are now desperate for cash to plug the deficit. Gazprom's biggest problem is that it gets paid for only 60 percent of the gas it sells at home, and then mostly by barter. The low rate made it fall behind in its tax payments, but it finally paid off its final $608 million in tax arrears this week and can now try to raise more money abroad for costly production and export projects. But how Gazprom's international auditor Price Waterhouse will value the barter, and thus the company, which had 1996 pre-tax profit of 45 trillion roubles ($7.8 billion), is unknown. ""It's difficult to say what the company will be worth,"" said Butayev. ""There exist big discrepancies with the collection rate and how you convert barter into cash."" Analysts said Gazprom was unlikely to use the annual meeting to announce radical changes to its strategy. ""The one significant piece of information we're waiting for is the international accounts standards, "" said Butayev, referring to the question of just how rich the wealthy company is. ""But I don't think they'll release them at the meeting. ""Otherwise, there will be no big surprises as far as the fundamentals are concerned."" The fundamentals for Gazprom, which has 34 percent of world gas reserves, 27 percent of annual global output and accounts for 60 percent of Europe's gas imports, are good. Gazprom plans to issue two $1 billion Eurobonds and a $1 billion convertible bond by early 1998. It plans a second tranche of its wildly-successful American Depositary Shares (ADSs) next year and has mandated Credit Lyonnais and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson to organise a bridging loan of $1.2 billion and medium term credits of $2.5-$3.0 billion. Gazprom, 40 percent state-owned, plans to offer nine percent of its equity to foreign investors. Gazprom's market capitalisation has doubled this year to $16.5 billion. Ekho-Moskvy radio said influential financier and politician Boris Berezovsky, a force in Russia's oil sector and member of the Security Council, was lobbying to join Gazprom's board. Abroad, Gazprom is looking to double its gas exports to Europe by 2010 via its $40 billion Yamal production and pipeline project -- plans requiring financing which in turn requires Gazprom not bicker with the government about taxes. ""Gazprom is a state within a state, and it's in its best interests to cooperate with the government,"" Butayev said. ""The company is a pragmatist."" ","LynnleyBrowning"
"A halt in shipments of generic blood glucose test strips distributed by Chronimed Inc could reduce the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings by as much as $0.06 per share if they are not resumed during the quarter, said chief financial officer Norman Cocke. ""If we ship none of (the strips) in the quarter, we're forecasting it could be up to $0.06 per share adverse impact,"" Cocke said in an interview with Reuters. ""If the thing is resolved very soon, and it could be, then there is no impact."" Shares in Chronimed were off 2-7/8 to 12-1/8.   The consensus of analysts' estimates for Chronimed earnings for the quarter ending in late March is $0.14 per share, he said. The company earned $0.11 per share in the three-month period ended March 29, 1996. Quik Check strips are manufactured by privately held Diagnostic Solutions Inc, of Irvine, Calif., and designed for use with the popular OneTouch blood glucose monitor for diabetics manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The strips are the only generic option to J&amp;J's branded OneTouch strips. Minneapolis-based Chronimed is the exclusive distributor of Quick Check strips.   Shipments of the strips were voluntarily halted by Diagnostic and Chronimed in December after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raised questions about the consistency of the blood test results they render, Cocke said. ""Diagnostic Solutions is working with (the FDA) actively to reach resolution, but we have gotten no signal, if you will, as to when that would occur,"" Cocke said. Chronimed is uncertain as to what led the FDA to question and test the Quik Check strips, but added the agency routinely monitors the product quality in blood glucose test markets.   ""We are investigating this company,"" said an FDA spokeswoman, regarding Diagnostic Solutions. She declined further comment. In fiscal 1996, Chronimed realized slightly less than 10 percent of its revenues on Quik Check strip sales, Cocke said. In early 1995, Quik Check strip production was put on hold for six months by Diagnostic as the company worked on improving its manufacturing efficiency and quality. Output resumed in August 1995. ""Their volume of shipment and their general consistency of quality has been very good and quite to our satisfaction since then,"" Cocke said.   Volpe Welty industry analyst Ann Logue said the Quik Check business is very profitable when it is active. But she questioned why Chronimed, which has several other growing lines of business, chooses to stay with it. ""There's evidence that this supplier is somewhat unreliable,"" she said. Chronimed is committed to the product, Cocke said. ""We've had our difficulties with it, but we think we can work through them,"" he said, adding that Chronimed's independent testing of the strips shows they comply with industry standards. The generic Quik Check sells for about 20 percent less than J&amp;J's branded strip in the drugstore, Cocke said. Diabetics must check their blood glucose levels several times daily. Most do so by pricking a finger and dabbing the drop of blood onto a paper strip that is then inserted into a machine that tests it for glucose level. Diagnostic Solutions could not be reached for comment. ((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787)) ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"Fourth quarter results so far from the regional Bells show a breathless increase in demand across the U.S. for additional lines, wireless phones and services like caller ID. There are no signs of it slowing. Analysts said results on Tuesday from Bell Atlantic Corp, NYNEX Corp and SBC Communications Inc generally met aggressive market expectations. ""These companies have clearly raised the bar on expectations for demand growth. It should be sustainable for 1997,"" said Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. However, the share prices of the group continue to reflect investors worries about looming competition in the Bell's core local markets and how well they will do in long distance. ""The big issue is competition and when does that have an impact,"" Klugman said. In the meantime, booming demand continues to show up at the Bells' bottom line. ""Both Bell Atlantic and NYNEX reported better expected than results compared to analysts' consensus,"" said Bill Vogel, an analyst at brokers Dillon Reed. SBC was a cent below the First Call consensus of $0.91 for the fourth quarter, but SBC chief financial officer Don Kiernan said that this was less when rounding errors were removed. The 1996 consensus of $3.46 was hit dead on. ""Its really much closer (to fourth quarter consensus) than it looks,"" Kiernan told Reuters. Analysts were sanguine about SBC's performance. ""Generally SBC met aggressive expectations for revenue. Expenses were higher than we expected, but offset by a lower tax rate and a $22 million revenue boost from a regulatory change,"" said Bill Deatherage of brokers Bear Stearns. Deatherage said the higher expenses seem to have come from Internet and data transport initiatives, investment for long distance services and Americast.

"A Canadian exploration company's claim to have made the biggest gold find this century were cast into doubt on Wednesday when its mining partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. ( ) said tests of the Indonesian deposit showed insignificant amounts of gold. Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd. admitted that the test samples of the deposit on the Busang gold property, deep in the jungles of Borneo, may have been overstated. Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh, who has made millions from the discovery and now lives in the Bahamas, said in a statement that ""there appears to be a strong possibility that the potential gold resources on the Busang project in East Kalimantan, Indonesia have been overstated because of invalid samples and assaying of those samples."" Freeport said in a statement that analyses of its own drilling results so far ""indicate insignificant amounts of gold."" The news caused pandemonium on the Toronto Stock Exchange, where Bre-X has been the hottest story for months. Traders said the share price, which was last quoted at C$15.50, could collapse to C$2. The stock was halted in Toronto until further notice, the exchange said. Bre-X had issued confirmed estimates that the Busang deposit held at least 71 million ounces of gold, worth about $20 billion at current gold prices. At that level Busang would be the most significant gold find since the discovery of the Witwatersrand goldfields in South Africa the late 1800s. Bre-X officials had even asserted that Busang deposit could contain as much as 200 million ounces. Bre-X shares, which had traded at an all-time high of C$28.65 after a 10-for-1 stock split, sank last week after an Indonesian newspaper report quoted unnamed sources as saying New Orleans-based Freeport, which holds 15 per cent of the Busang deposit, had doubts about the size and viability of the deposit.    The rumors were fanned to a fever pitch by the mysterious death, billed as a suicide, of Bre-X's chief geologist Michael de Guzman, who fell to his death from a helicopter en route to the Busang site last Wednesday. Bre-X said De Guzman was depressed because he was suffering from a serious illness. The Bre-X board assured shareholders on Monday that it had ""absolute confidence in the integrity and accuracy of assay results and resource calculations."" Traders have described the complex Bre-X saga as a ""soap opera"" and are wondering who or what to believe. ""I've concluded the only person who could ever make a movie out of this is Alfred Hitchcock. It's become so bizarre that people have lost any tolerance for staying in,"" Goepel Shields analyst Rick Cohen said last week. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"Canada's French-speaking political leaders voiced anger on Friday about a new pre-election ad that suggested Quebec-born politicians did not have what it takes to keep Quebec from leaving Canada. ""The suggestion that where you are born should determine whether or not you should be prime minister of the country is to say the least offensive,"" a sombre Jean Charest, leader of the Conservative Party, told reporters in Ottawa. The ad, promoting the right-wing Reform Party, shows three French-speaking Canadian party leaders -- including Canadian Prime Minister and Liberal leader Jean Chretien -- along with Quebec Premier and leading separatist Lucien Bouchard. As the ad calls for ""a voice for all Canadians, not just Quebec politicians,"" the images of the four Quebeckers are circled in red and then each face is crossed out. Canada has had Quebec prime ministers for 19 of the last 20 years -- Quebec has a crucial one-quarter of the population -- and Chretien led Canada in an October 1995 referendum that Quebec sovereigntists lost by only one point. Three of the five political leaders contesting the June 2 election are from Quebec: Charest, Chretien and the leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe. Aside from Reform's Preston Manning, from the West, the New Democratic Party's Alexa McDonough is the only non-Quebecker to lead a major political party in this campaign. ""Mr. Manning is setting a very bad example,"" the normally upbeat Charest said, looking troubled. ""He's sending a message here that one part of the country doesn't count."" Chretien declared in Niagara Falls: ""I want to tell Mr. Manning that people don't like his divisiveness."" Manning, who advocates decentralization to please both Quebec and other provinces, contends the traditional parties have failed to devise a method to keep Canada together. ""The separatists do damage by what they do. The old-line federalists do damage by what they do not do, the plan that they do not have, the alternative model they do not have, the strategies they do not have for the next referendum. ""We're saying each is equally dangerous in its own way to the unity of the country."" But Manning -- running second in the polls outside Quebec -- has no voter base in Quebec and a poll released on Friday showed the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois neck-and-neck in the vote-rich French-speaking province. It was not clear how his strategy would play across the country, but as often before in this 36-day campaign, he managed to get other politicians talking about his issues. ""It can divide the country. What he is doing I think is an act of desperation,"" said one Liberal voter, retired engineer Bal Sandhu of from the western city of Edmonton, Alberta. But many voters are sick of the Quebec issue coming up again and again and think Quebec manages to get a disproportionate share of Ottawa's attention. ""They get more opportunities than the rest of the country, because the government is bending over backwards to try and keep them in the confederation,"" a disenchanted Edmonton technologist, John Mushka, said in a phone interview. Charest has been rising steadily in popularity since televised leadership debates last week which put national unity at the center of the election campaign. He is on an intense two-day tour of Quebec to build momentum, with a keen eye on forming the official opposition. The Bloc Quebecois fills that role, giving Canada an official opposition whose goal is to break up the country. The Reform Party, with its strong support in Western Canada, also has hopes of forming the official opposition. The stakes are high for Charest, who is personally popular but whose party suffers from a turbulent past. The Tories fell to only two seats in the 1993 election after controlling the government for eight years. And former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is reviled across Canada.

"Air Foyle is due to fly flight simulators into China next month as part of its targetted future business growth, sales director with special responsibilities for Asia and China, George Short told Reuters. The specialist outsize cargo carrier said one of its Antonov AN-124 freighters has been contracted to transport two flight simulators and associated equipment from Tulsa, Oklahoma to a new training centre being built by the aviation training company FlightSafety International at Kunming in Yunnan Province. Air Foyle is the worldwide general sales agent for Russia's Antonov Design Bureau. The Antonov 124 aircraft can carry loads of more than 140 tons, Short said. ""We are due to fly the first Antonov flight into Kunming around December 18 with a 737 and 757/767 simulator. We are also due to do another flight for Volkswagen's new car plant being built under licence near Shanghai. There are so many projects going on within China and the Antonov is the ideal vehicle for moving a lot of the heavy industrial machinery that is needed in the development which is going in the nether regions of China which don't have sophisticated ground handling facilities,"" Short said in an interview from his airline's headquarters at Luton in England. Demand from China has been increasing dramatically, the airline said. Recent flights have moved satellites, locomotives, power generation equipment, car assembly line equipment and Pitts Special aerobatic aircraft for China's first airshow earlier this month at Zhuhai. One Antonov flight to Urumqi in western China flew heavy power generation equipment from Italy in 36 hours. If the equipment had arrived by sea, it would have taken 22 days to travel overland from the Chinese coast, Short said. The executive said he was in Hong Kong last week to develop further business contacts in Asia and especially within China. ""I try to go to China about every three months. We are working within the different regions in China to work with suitable marketing partners. It's an interesting market because 70 percent of cargoes are oversize or heavyweight cargoes. We are not a threat to conventional airlines but the shipping lines."" ""Dealing with Chinese officials now is so much easier.

"Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday profits jumped 82 percent to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as it rebounded from product launches that held profits down a year earlier. Ford, the last of the Big Three Detroit automakers to report fourth-quarter results, said the earnings equalled $1 a share. The results reflected a total of $132 million in special charges, including costs related to Ford's decision to cut 3,500 jobs last year. In the 1995 quarter, Ford earned $660 million, or 49 cents a share. Sales rose to $38.8 billion from $34.6 billion. Excluding one-time items, Ford's fourth quarter income was $1.10 a share -- higher than the $1.02 a share forecast by analysts, according to First Call, which tracks estimates. Although Ford appears to be making headway in cost reduction, analysts were not overly impressed, noting that sales of high-profit light truck products are booming. ""They were not great, especially in view of the fact that they are selling a lot trucks,"" said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz &amp; Co. Ford Chairman Alex Trotman said in a statement that automotive earnings will improve in 1997, because the company has successfully completed its highest-volume launches in North America and Europe. ""We're starting 1997 in a much stronger competitive position,"" he said. Trotman said Ford expects better results for all of 1997 in Europe, where the company is moving to cut costs. Ford also predicted smaller losses in South America for 1997, he added. ""Overall, we are on track,"" he said. Meantime, Ford Chief Financial Officer John Devine told reporters that cost-cutting will reach new heights in 1997. For the first time, Ford expects 1997 costs to be below those of the prior year. The fourth quarter results capped a mixed year for the automaker in which strong profits from its Financial Services Group were needed to offset a steady flow of red ink from overseas operations. Earnings for all of 1996 rose 7 percent to $4.4 billion, or $3.65 a share, from $4.1 billion, or $3.34 in 1995. Ford's worldwide automotive operations posted net income of $1.6 billion, down from $2 billion. Financial Services earned a record $2.8 billion in 1996, up 33 percent over 1995. Revenues for the year climbed to $147.0 billion from $137.1 billion in 1995. Ford's core U.S. automotive operations, which contribute about 65 percent of total automotive revenues, reported profits of $628 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $168 million a year ago. Ford continued to have problems overseas, but there were signs of progress in turning those operations around. Ford's European loss for the quarter rose to $88 million from $48 million. But excluding $127 million in severance charges in the 1996 quarter, the operating results showed a $39 million profit, versus a $26 million operating profit last year. In South America, where Ford has struggled in the Brazilian market, the fourth quarter net loss was $287 million, compared with a $112 million loss a year ago. ""I thought the fourth quarter was an okay quarter. What was most important was improvement on the cost front,"" said Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. On Tuesday, General Motors Corp. said strike costs slashed fourth quarter earnings by 50 percent to $786 million. Chrysler Corp. last week said fourth quarter earnings fell to $807 million, down from $1.04 billion. Ford's stock lost 12.5 cents to close at 32.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. ","ToddNissen"
"Barrick Gold Corp said on Wednesday it was now the world's second largest gold producer, supplanting Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd. Barrick's 1996 gold production was 3,148,801 ounces, surpassing Gold Fields' 3,125,631 ounces for fiscal 1996. Barrick expects 1997 production to top three million ounces again. The Toronto-based company posted a 40 percent increase in its proven and probable reserves to 51 million ounces from 36.5 million ounces. Barrick also reported 25 million ounces of gold in the resource category -- gold not fully proven yet. Barrick has made no secret of its ambition to become the world's largest gold company, surpassing Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd. To clinch first place, Barrick is seeking control of the huge Busang deposit in Indonesia, said to be one of this century's most sensational gold discoveries. Two new mines will also likely carry Barrick closer to its leadership goal. Drilling at Barrick's Pierina property in Peru expanded reserves there to 6.5 million ounces so far, Barrick said. The mine is expected to come into production in late 1999 at an annual rate of 500,000 ounces of gold. Drilling at Barrick's Pascua mine in Chile bumped reserves to 10 million ounces so far, with 6.7 million ounces identified in the reserve category. The mine is scheduled to start production of 400,000 ounces a year by the year 2000. Barrick has been negotiating with Calgary's Bre-X Minerals Ltd for months to control the Busang discovery, but Barrick's chances of success are up in the air. ""One of the messages they'll probably try to get across is that they are not desperate for it, they certainly don't need it, they have an awful lot already,"" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac with Deacon Capital in Toronto. Barrick also said today that its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings fell, due mainly to higher operating and exploration costs. Fourth-quarter profit declined to US$56 million or US$0.15 a share from year earlier US$78 million or US$0.22 a share. Full-year earnings declined to US$218 million or US$0.60 a share from US$292 million or US$0.82 a share in 1995. Barrick was down 0.40 to 35.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in afternoon trading on Wednesday and by 3/8 to 26-1/2 in New York. ","HeatherScoffield"
"The Czech National Bank (CNB) on Tuesday put the largest fully-private bank, Agrobanka a.s., under forced administration due to liquidity problems arising from the failure of another bank, Kreditni Banka a.s.. The central bank, in its 12th intervention into a commercial bank in the post-Communist period, said it would guarantee all of Agrobanka's deposits during a ""temporary"" forced administration period of an unspecified duration. In a statement issued after an overnight meeting of the Czech cabinet, the CNB said that problems of Agrobanka, the country's fifth largest overall, had arisen as a consequence of the failure of Kreditni Banka a.s.. It also said the move stemmed from the investigation of people in the Kreditni case -- in which five people connected to Kreditni have been indicted on fraud charges -- who are also connected to Agrobanka. ""The investigation of the fall of Kreditni Banka...and its politicization, and charges against people connected to Agrobanka, negatively influences the liquidity position of this bank (Agrobanka),"" the CNB said in its statement. While over 70 percent of banking activity in the country is down within the four largest banks -- each with the state as a major shareholder -- Agrobanka has grown to be the largest fully-private bank with four billion crowns ($151 million) in basic capital. In order to support Agrobanka, the CNB said it would guarantee all deposits at the bank, and that it would ensure, in cooperation with other commercial banks, sufficient ""financial sources"" for Agrobanka, should it need them. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the central bank's move was a preventative step aimed at keeping the banking sector sound. ""There isn't even the slightest reason for any sort of banking panic,"" Klaus told journalists on Tuesday. He said the move by the central bank is a way to stop problems in the banking sector escalating. The fall in August of Kreditni, based in the western city of Plzen, caused a political furore and led local media to question the effectiveness of bank supervision. Kreditni and Agrobanka were linked to each other through the secretive Czech investment group Motoinvest which used both banks to finance its securities operations. An official from Motoinvest was indicted last weeekend for a debt swap scheme which police said led, in-part, to the failure of Kreditni Banka. But Motoinvest has denied any responsibility for the failure of Kreditni which caused losses of about 12 billion crowns. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=26.51 Czech Crown) ","JohnMastrini"
"Boeing Co. stock surged Tuesday after the company decided to mothball plans to build a costly stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet. Boeing shares jumped $7.375 to a record $113.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, accounting for much of the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is one of 30 stocks in the index of blue-chip companies. Industry analysts estimated the move by the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, announced late on Monday, could reduce Boeing's expenses by more than $2 billion over the next five years and boost annual earnings by as much as $1 a share. NatWest Securities analyst Nick Heymann said the decision not to proceed with the risky project removed a cloud of uncertainty over Boeing as it boosts production to meet rising demand and prepares to complete its planned $14 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp. ""It's fantastic news,"" he said. While officials at Boeing rival Airbus Industrie said the European consortium would go ahead with plans for an all-new superjumbo jetliner called the A-3XX, Heymann said he thought that project was dead. ""Airbus never really had the resources to go ahead with their aircraft,"" Heymann said. He said it was even less likely the consortium could raise the funds now that Boeing had talked with the same potential customers and determined market conditions did not justify the investment needed for a new big jet. Boeing said it would cost more than $7 billion just to develop a new wing and make other changes needed to produce two new versions of the 747 that would add range and capacity. Analysts noted that the estimated cost of developing the so-called 747-500X and 747-600X had ballooned over the past two years from about $3 billion as prospective customers such as British Airways Plc and Singapore Airlines Ltd. demanded more features. In the end, only Thai Airways International Ltd. and Malaysian Airline System committed to ordering the proposed new four-engine jetliner. Boeing executives said the projected demand for fewer than 500 very large jets over the next 20 years was not enough to generate a sufficient shareholder return. ""Sufficient market demand has not yet developed to justify committing the significant investment required to develop larger versions of the 747,"" Ron Woodard, president of the Boeing commercial airplane group, said in a statement. While most of the 1,000 Boeing employees working on the 747-X project will be shifted to other planned derivatives, Woodard said Boeing would continue studying the possibility of a jet bigger than the current 747-400. Airbus, which projects a far bigger market for jets that can seat more than 500 passengers, has said it can develop an all-new jet for $8 billion, but analysts pegged the total cost at closer to a whopping $15 billion. Analysts said Airbus could develop an attractive airliner to alleviate congestion at the world's biggest airports and on heavily travelled routes, but they were sceptical about the consortium's ability to keep costs down. ""At the end of the day it's going to come down to the cost of building the airplane,"" said Byron Callan of Merrill Lynch. ""This only increases the pressure on Airbus to restructure and restructure quickly."" He said Airbus now might be more willing to take the risk needed to launch a new large jet to break Boeing's monopoly on the lucrative top end of the market. Citing increasing ""route fragmentation,"" especially across the Pacific Ocean, Boeing said it plans to focus development efforts on new versions of the medium-sized 767 and 777 twin-engine models. Boeing already has begun offering an increased-capacity version of the 767 that could be launched in coming months. Boeing also is considering new versions of the 777 that would add both capacity and range. ","MartinWolk"
"Hong Kong's leader-designate Tung Chee-hwa said on Thursday a series of meetings with China's top communist leaders had boosted his confidence in the future of the British colony under Chinese sovereignty next year. Shipping magnate Tung also said he could foresee no problems in the territory that would require Beijing's help after the territory returned to China at midnight on June 30, 1997. ""At the moment I can see no problems that would require the special help of the central government,"" Tung told a news conference a day after Chinese President Jiang Zemin assured him of Beijing's full support after he takes office. If such a situation were to arise, Tung said he would immediately ask for assistance from Beijing. Jiang on Wednesday greeted Tung with a pledge of support and a vow not to tread on Hong Kong's right to autonomy after 150 years of British colonial rule come to an end. The appointment of the tycoon turned chief executive designate to lead Hong Kong from July 1 next year marked the dawn of a new age, Jiang said. Tung said he would return home with greater confidence in Hong Kong's future after his meetings in Beijing with Jiang and Premier Li Peng that set the communist seal of approval on his selection as Hong Kong's first leader of the post-colonial era. China's leaders all stressed their sincerity in granting Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", Tung said, referring to Beijing's pledge not to meddle with Hong Kong's capitalist system for 50 years. ""That gave me even more confidence in Hong Kong's future,"" he said. Asked about the rank he expected to be accorded in China's communist or state bureaucracy, Tung stressed the unique position Hong Kong would hold after its return to China. ""I think I will not be ranked with anybody else because we are a special sitution,"" he said. ""We are going to exercise a high degree of autonomy."" However, he urged Hong Kong's 6.3 million people to face the fact of China's decision to disband the territory's existing elected legislature after the handover and to replace it with its own appointed provisional body. ""The best way to minimise conflict is to recognise the reality of the provisional legislature,"" Tung said when asked how he would deal with potential conflicts caused by the existence of a Hong Kong-elected legislature as well as a Beijing-approved body in the run-up to the handover. ""There is a need for the provisional legislature to start meeting before July 1 because there is work that needs to be done in order to avoid a legal vacuum,"" he said. Tung's first visit to Beijing since his appointment is being closely watched by Hong Kong residents keen to know more about his plans for the first post-colonial adminstration and to learn whether current senior civil servants will keep their jobs. On the issue of civil servant appointments, Tung said this would be among his first duties when he returned, but gave no hint of his position or intentions. ""I do things rather methodically, step by step, and I will do that on this issue as well,"" he said. Tung, who has warned Hong Kong's people to be sensitive to China's sovereign rights, has yet to give details of his plans for the post-colonial administration. While China has said it will leave Hong Kong's free-wheeling capitalist system intact after the handover, it has made clear that the authoritiy of the territory's leader will have limits.

"A funeral cortege bearing the body of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping arrived at Beijing's Babaoshan cemetery for cremation on Monday as China began paying last respects to the man who transformed the nation. The cortege was led by four black cars followed by a white van bedecked with black and yellow ribbons, the colours of mourning in China, that served as the hearse for Deng's body. The van was flanked by two Red Flag limousines. Hundreds of armed police lined the streets along the 2.5 km (1.5 mile) route to the cemetery from a military hospital, where Deng's body has lain since he died last Wednesday aged 92. The cortege of about 30 vehicles moved at a pace slightly faster than walking to allow thousands of mourners lining the route a last glimpse of the man who ruled China for 18 years. ""I have come to say goodbye to Deng Xiaoping,"" said one young man as the cavalcade moved past. China has sought to present an image of stability and continuity in the sensitive aftermath of the passing of Deng, who transformed China by pursuing capitalist-style reforms while maintaining Communist Party control. Since his death, authorities have heightened security around the capital and especially in Tiananmen Square, the vast central space where the country will commemorate Deng with official memorial rites at the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday. No foreign dignitaries have been invited to the funeral. Deng's ashes will be scattered at sea. Deng, an early opponent of the leadership cult around his predecessor the late Chairman Mao Zedong, made clear he wanted his death to be followed by more restrained mourning than the near-hysteria that followed Mao's demise in 1976. Chinese sources said the military had been placed on alert to deal with potential ethnic unrest or any other threat to stability as China negotiates the delicate first days of political transition. So far, the public has seen a display of unanimity at the top of China's communist power structure, with the supreme leader's hand-picked successor, Jiang Zemin, vowing to keep China on the road of economic reform. But Chinese political analysts said cracks were appearing in the facade and Jiang, who holds the top state, party and military posts and is now the most powerful man in China, may be trying to throw his weight around too soon. State media have publicised a request by Deng's family that his body not be put on public display, that his corneas be donated to an eye bank and that parts of his body be offered for medical dissection.

"Healthcare and oil companies are expected to be bigger players in 1997's corporate merger boom, although most of the activity is still likely to be dominated by telecommunications, utilities and insurance. Several other sectors, including airlines and railroads, also are on the verge of participating in the deal frenzy that has gripped corporate America for nearly two years. And the merger pace shows no sign of slowing in 1997 from 1996's record, said investment bankers and merger experts.   ""We see no reason why the (merger and acquisition) cycle should slow down.  We think the boom will continue through (1997),"" said Philip Keevil, managing director at Salomon Brothers. A record $658.8 billion worth of transactions was announced in 1996, far surpassing initial expectations for the year, according to figures compiled by Securities Data Co, a Newark, N.J.-based firm that tracks deals. The key driver in the current merger trend has been the high-flying stock market, coupled with corporate trends that stress consolidation and cost-cutting.   ""At the beginning of 1996, it looked like it would be another good year for mergers.  That got blown to pieces. It's hard to know if (1997) will be better, but it feels real good,"" said Steven Wolitzer, managing partner and co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Lehman Brothers. Industry experts said the pipeline for potential deals appears full for at least the first six months of 1997. ""We're at a really high level of activity.  There is good corporate profitability and people are using their money for share buybacks and acquisitions,"" said Robert Lovejoy, managing director at Lazard Freres &amp; Co.   And investors like to see acquisitions. ""Shareholders expect managements to be taking pro-active steps to generate value-enhancing transactions.  And the management of these corporations realize they can't count on the stock market"" to boost profitability, said Bruce Nolop, managing director at Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. Federal deregulation is expected to drive more consolidation in telecommunications and utilities, two of the most active sectors in 1996.  The telecommunications sector rang up the biggest deals of 1996 and the utilities industry also played a large role in the year's transactions.   Although healthcare companies already have participated in the merger boom, experts anticipate more consolidation among pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health maintenance organizations. Merger experts also predict energy companies, which spent much of 1996 forming alliances and divesting properties, will become more aggressive buyers and sellers in 1997.  The nation's refiners, plagued with poor profit margins, especially are expected to participate in the merger trend. Meanwhile, the prospect of mergers is hovering over the nation's airlines. Industry experts believe airline industry consolidation is inevitable, especially as AMR Corp's American Airlines subsidiary and British Airways Plc pursue a wide-reaching partnership. Similarly, a resolution if the takeover battle for Conrail Inc will likely trigger other railroad mergers, experts said. CSX Corp and Norfolk Southern Corp are locked in a bidding war for Conrail and the losing railroad is likely to seek another partner. ","RobinSidel"
"Lloyd's of London Names -- the traditional backers of Lloyd's insurance market -- will have to dig deep in their pockets in future if as expected a working party set up to assess the market's funding recommends an increase in the minimum amounts Names provide to support their underwriting, insurance sources said. Lloyd's, still smarting from massive claims suffered by the market between 1988 and 1992, is expected to announce fundamental changes to its capital structure in the next week, the sources said on Wednesday. According to the sources, the report filed by the working party should be published within the next few days. At present Names must put up between 20 and 30 percent of their underwriting capacity as deposits, compared with 50 percent for corporate investors. Under the working party's plans Names may be required to provide at least 32.5 percent next year, and 37.5 percent in the following year, according to a report in Britain's Financial Times newspaper. One source at Lloyds described the figures as looking ""familiar in terms of earlier discusssions here"". The new system would require all investors to show evidence of assets totalling 50 percent of premiums. The eight billion pound ($13 billion) losses between 1988 and 1992, which have prompted the latest changes and at one point threatened to sink Lloyd's, ushered in the introduction of corporate capital for the first time and a decline in the number of Names to below 10,000 for the first time since the mid-70s. In 1989, the figure was over 34,000. Corporate funds now account for around 44 percent of this year's 10.3 billion pound capacity and since their introduction have been strengthening ties with managing agents which run insurance syndicates. Only last week Commercial Union became the first major composite insurer to enter Lloyd's with the purchase of Marlborough Underwriting Agency. The developments raise questions about Names' long term future at Lloyd's and some observers expect the share of corporate capacity to rise to two-thirds or more by the turn of the century.

Garrison said the company was seeking to show ""leadership in a business that's sort of gone haywire."" He said the pricing plan was developed after collating responses from more than 25,000 subscribers. ""It was important that somebody lead the industry away from this craziness,"" he added. The largest U.S. consumer online service, America Online Inc, raised a rage of protest and lawsuits after it announced a $19.95 a month flat fee Internet access plan and couldn't keep up with demand for access. Garrison said the company's research provided an answer of ""a resounding no"" to whether it could provide a ""successful business that is $19.95, has unlimited access, unlimited usage and quality service."" Garrison said the Netcom plan is geared towards active Internet users who frequently combine the Internet usage with their business day and require access from work, home and on the road.

"British supermarket group Safeway Plc is currently seeing a zero inflation rate excluding petrol, deputy chairman David Webster told Reuters in an interview. ""Inflation excluding petrol is now probably zero,"" he said. But Webster said the fall in prices was ""nothing to do with a price war.""   Webster said he felt shoppers ""are pulling in their belts a little more than usual,"" and added he felt it was ""a sector issue."" But he said he thought a price war remained ""very unlikely."" Safeway said in a statement that price inflation had fallen in the early weeks of the new year from a modest 1.1 percent gain seen in the five weeks to January 4. It said sales growth over the key Christmas trading period had been 5.2 percent but over the first 16 weeks of the second half that had slowed to a 4.5 percent gain. ""In the last four weeks the sector and Safeway have come off quite sharply in terms of overall sales performance,"" Webster said. Safeway said in its statement that if current rates of sales growth and inflation continued, profits in the final eight weeks of its year, which ends in March, might be affected. Webster said it was ""very hard to judge"" whether the slowdown in sales would continue. ""We continue to see significant deflation in produce, which is 10 percent of total sales,"" he said. He declined to give details of the impact on margins, however. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","JoWinterbottom"
"The tough job of reversing the steady decline of Snapple sales passed Thursday from Quaker Oats Co, which couldn't pull it off, to a firm that rescued the similar Mistic beverage line last year, but which is itself in transition. In agreeing to acquire Snapple for $300 million in cash, Triarc Cos Inc took on a task at which Quaker labored for 2-1/2 years without success. At the same time, Triarc's deal cast a new light on its pending plans to spin off its beverage and fast-food businesses, analysts said.   Buying Snapple could affect the proposed spinoff of Mistic, Royal Crown soft drinks and Arby's restaurants into a new company, said Triarc spokesman Martin Shea. ""We're waiting for an IRS ruling"" on the spinoff, he said. The effect could be a plus, said analysts, who suggested the deal shows Triarc is serious about making sense out of its jumble of assets and becoming a player in consumer brands. ""This new management team at Triarc is damn good,"" said Wheat First Butcher Singer food industry analyst John Maxwell. Based in New York, Triarc was pieced together during the anything-goes junk-bond era by Victor Posner, analysts said.   Posner exited when Triarc was taken over by financiers Nelson Peltz and Peter May in 1993. They have since followed a course of asset redistribution aimed at rationalizing Triarc's businesses and attracting more Wall Street attention. In the past four years, Triarc has gained new respect, sold 16 businesses, paid off $500 million in debt and raised $200 million in cash, Shea said. The firm bought Mistic for $95 million in 1995. In 1996, the juice line posted sales of $130 million. Triarc's Royal Crown soft drink line had 1996 sales of about $175 million, said Triarc beverage chief executive Michael Weinstein.   ""We know how to make a brand succeed,"" Weinstein said. That knowledge will be needed to turn around Snapple. The brand virtually invented the premium soft drink category, and it remains the market leader. But Snapple sales have declined every year since 1994. Last year, they were $551 million, down eight percent from 1995, Quaker reported. Quaker, the Chicago-based food giant, acquired Snapple in December 1994 near the height of its popularity for $1.8 billion, including acquisition costs. The sale price agreed to this week with Triarc will force Quaker to post a $1.4 billion one-time loss in its first quarter.   ""The (Snapple) investment's been a disaster"" for Quaker, said Prudential Securities food analyst John McMillin. Wall Street treated Quaker kindly Thursday, however, following the announcement of the sale, reflecting some relief that the company finally sold off the money-losing unit. Shares in Quaker -- which retains such crown jewel products as Gatorade and several cereal brands -- closed up 1/4 at 37-3/4. Shares in Triarc closed up 1-5/8 at 17-3/8.

"Unilever Plc stirred up the entire chemicals sector on Tuesday with surprise news that it plans to sell most of its speciality chemicals businesses. The announcement of the massive disposal programme, which analysts said could net up to five billion pounds ($8.17 billion) for the Anglo-Dutch group, sparked a rash of speculation about potential buyers. The four businesses, National Starch &amp; Chemical Co, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield, had total sales of around three billion pounds last year and employ nearly 16,000 people in 35 countries. Analysts said the move, which could free Unilever up for a major acquisition in its core food, detergents and personal product businesses, was well timed. The company is taking advantage of a shake-up in chemicals as Europe gets to grips with overcapacity and increasing competition from the United States and Asia by swapping assets and disposing of non-core operations. Businesses like Unilever's are particularly attractive, offering higher margins and less volatile performance than industrial chemicals. With profit margins of more than 14 percent, Unilever's businesses ""are at the good end of the range,"" said Williams de Broe analyst Peter Cartwright. Kleinwort Benson analyst Jeremy Chantry said: ""This is a highly saleable and attractive portfolio."" He added that the businesses were likely to be sold ""in big pieces"". Another analyst, who asked not to be named, said U.S.-based National Starch, which makes industrial adhesives, resins and speciality starches, could fetch 1.3 to 1.5 times its annual sales. The Quest fragrances and flavourings business and the Unichema natural oils businesses, both based in the Netherlands, might be worth 1.5 times their annual turnover. But Kleinwort's Chantry noted that ""these are high margin businesses and some could be going for two times sales"". With no obvious buyer for the whole package, speculation centred on possible interest for the different segments. Williams de Broe's Cartwright said industrial adhesives and resins could both be a target for Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries Plc, which wants to buy lighter chemicals operations and move away from industrial products. Analysts said ICI, which has little debt, could also be interested in the petroleum and plastics catalysts business of British-based Crosfield. Another analyst said National Starch could interest other U.S. firms. ""A lot of the big processors in the States, like Cargill, make raw starch and haven't moved on into the value-added chain, which is what National Starch is in. Those big food processors may be interested in that,"" he added. Quest is also in a sector seeing major rationalisation. Switzerland's Roche Holding AG spent $1.1 billion last week buying flavours group Tastemaker, paying more than 3.4 times Tastemaker's annual sales. Another major player in the sector, International Flavors and Fragrances Inc of the United States, said last year it was not interested in buying another flavours company, but it could be attracted by Quest's investment in biotechnology. Unichema, whose products include lubricants and ingredients for polymers, soap and skincare products, might be of interest to one of the five or six major players in this segment. They include Witco Corp of the United States and the German groups Henkel KGaA  HNKG-p.F and Degussa AG. --London Newsroom +44 71 542 7717 ($1=.6120 Pound) ","JonathanBirt"
"Shares of 3Com Corp and U.S. Robotics Corp slid on Monday as prospects dimmed for a new suitor emerging to rescue Robotics shareholders unhappy with the proposed merger of the two firms, traders said. The agreement binding 3Com and Robotics to the $7.3-billion merger, announced last Wednesday, requires either party to pay up to $160 million if the deal falls through, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission 8-K filing over the weekend. 3Com closed on Monday at 32-13/16, down 19/64 on the day. U.S. Robotics shares, which have traded in tandem with the ups and downs of 3Com stock, closed at 55-3/8, down 7/16. Terms of the merger call for 3Com to exchange 1.75 shares of its stock for each Robotics share. The exchange ratio is fixed with no collar, according to officials of the two companies. The value of the 3Com offer to Robotics shareholders -- which stood at $68 when the deal was announced -- has fallen in line with the six-point decline in 3Com shares. At Monday's close, the offer was worth $57-27/64 in Robotics shares. Analysts said shareholder disatisfaction with the proposal extends into mid-level management at Robotics. Options given employees in recent years are worthless at current price levels.   One investment banker not involved in the deal said he made inquiries after the announcement seeking alternative bidders. ""What we found is that there was not a high level of interest among competitors to enter a rival bid to 3Com,"" he said. In the near-term, 3Com's rivals appear content to let the deal stand, seeing the distraction of managing the integration of 3Com, a leading corporate network supplier, with Robotics, the top consumer modem maker, as a competitive advantage. Competitors ""preferred to see 3Com and Robotics go through this period of pain instead of doing anything to break the deal up,"" the banker said. ""They feel this deal is going to slow 3Com in the near-term."" But analysts said the deal was vulnerable because it involved a stock swap only, leaving it open to someone willing to pay cash or a stronger stock price. A shareholder vote is not expected for several months, giving rivals time to mull options. ""It's very possible that if the 3Com price continues to fall, USRX continues to fall too,"" Senan said. ""If I were a USRX shareholder, I would be willing to consider other bids."" A U.S. Robotics spokeswoman, asked if the company had been approached by other potential bidders, said: ""As a matter of policy, we don't comment on rumors or speculation.""   One possible new suitor mentioned on Monday was network industry leader Cisco Systems Inc. Volpe, Welty and Co analyst Amar Senan said Cisco ""could certainly afford to buy U.S. Robotics with minimal dilution. It's speculation, but it is also possible. It all depends on how much of a threat Cisco sees in this merger."" Cisco fell 1-3/8 to 54-1/4 on Monday, topping the Nasdaq most active list with 12.5 million shares traded. Cisco officials were not immediately available for comment. -- New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ","EricAuchard"
"Regulators Tuesday began auctioning a slice of spectrum that will let users gain access to the Internet over the airwaves or create wireless local phone networks that compete with traditional wired networks. Twenty-four companies -- including units of BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, Comcast Corp. and a Bell Atlantic Corp./Nynex Corp. joint venture -- are bidding for the rights to offer ""wireless communications service,"" or WCS. The first day of bidding in the multi-day sale totalled $5.3 million. Analysts said recent financial problems among wireless carriers will put downward pressure on prices. It is the Federal Communication Commission's 14th airwave sale. ""I expect prices to go very low for this type of spectrum,"" said Elliott Hamilton, analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm. The FCC is auctioning 128 licenses. Of that total, 104 are 10 megahertz licenses that roughly cover state-wide areas. The remaining 24 permits are for 5 MHz of spectrum and cover larger regional areas. The FCC is not dictating what services companies can offer over this portion of the spectrum. Potential applications include broadband wireless access to the Internet, wireless local phone networks, and location services for pinpointing trucks and other vehicles. The value of wireless spectrum has fallen after last year's $10.2 billion auction of licenses for a new generation of cellular phones known as ""personal communications services,"" or PCS. Edward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine, said FCC officials ""should be ecstatic"" if the agency can net $2 billion from the lastest auction. Several top bidders at the PCS sale are under financial strain after bidding high prices. Wall Street has been reluctant to invest in the ventures. Also, FCC officials doubt wireless service providers can offer anytime soon the kind of mobile phone service available through PCS. FCC officials cite restrictions on the use of the wireless service airwaves that are meant to prevent interference among users of an upcoming digital radio service that will be broadcast coast-to-coast via satellite. The wireless service and digital radio airwaves are adjacent to one another. The FCC has raised some $23 billion through its airwave sales. But the financial problems among last year's PCS winners has raised doubts over whether the government will ever collect all the money it is owed. ","RogerFillion"
"Peptide Therapeutics Plc, a tiny Cambridge vaccine discovery company, moved firmly into the big time on Monday after signing up its second major strategic alliance in under three weeks. Shares in Peptide rocketed on news that Anglo-American drugs giant SmithKline Beecham Plc is to pay six million pounds up front for access to novel vaccines which could protect against allergic reactions ranging from mild hay fever to fatal food allergies. The stock rose 14 percent or 46 pence to 375 in late trading. Peptide, which only floated on the stock market in November 1995, has seen its shares rise 63 percent since the start of the year. Shares in technology group BTG Plc, which signed over patents for the vaccine to Peptide on Monday, rose 17 1/2 pence to 480. SmithKline, the world's biggest supplier of vaccines, is taking a 2.8 percent stake in Peptide for 3.6 million pounds ($5.88 million) and providing cash and licence payments of 2.4 million pounds. Peptide said it could receive another 24 million pounds from SmithKline, excluding any royalties on eventual sales. SmithKline's seal of approval for Peptide's science follows another high profile coup late last month, when Medeva PLC agreed to transfer its know-how in developing oral and nasal vaccines to the company. Peptide is now working on non-injectable vaccines to block a range of infections such as typhoid, flu and food poisoning by the e-coli bug. Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said Peptide had ""got some quite impressive partnerships. Medeva is not to be sniffed at and SmithKline is quite a big catch. It means they have validated what (Peptide) are doing."" The allergy vaccine was also backed by the British government last September in the form of 450,000 pounds development grant. Peptide said it had already proved succesful in small-scale trials against food allergies, which were often lethal, and Peptide believes it could work against allergic forms of asthma and eczema as well as adverse drug reactions. Peptide licensing director Nick Higgins, a key mover behind the SmithKline deal, told Reuters that several major companies had expressed an interest in the allergy vacccine, but SmithKline offered a stable, long-term alliance. Higgins said the first allergy product could be on sale around the turn of the century. Despite the flurry of recent deals finance director John Brown said there was room for other tie-ups, notably involving technology to allow rapid identification of protease inhibitors, which block enzymes crucial to a virus's ability to reproduce. Protease inhibitors have been used successfully against the HIV virus, but Brown said ""they clearly have many therapeutic possibilities,"" including tackling viral conditions like herpes. A novel treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is also in early stages of development. Yamaichi's Refsum said 400 pence ""looks like a fair price"" for Peptide shares, but he added that even this level ""may be undervaluing the rate of progress they are making."" But another analyst said the share price ""may be overcooked."" ""This is a superb deal for them,"" he said, but added ""it is going to take a long time to turn the interesting science into late-stage projects."" ($1=.6120 Pound) ","JonathanBirt"
"Several European airlines have removed a fuel cargo surcharge but plan to replace it with an increase in their published rates, industry sources told Reuters. The removal has been made by nearly all the airlines who originally imposed it and comes after a warning from the Hong Kong government that surcharges cannot be imposed nor rates lifted without government approval. To add to what observers say is a confusing situation, one of the territory's biggest carriers - Lufthansa Cargo - said it is not withdrawing the surcharge. The airline's general manager in Hong Kong, Frank Berweger, said he does not think a surcharge is illegal. ""We still believe that it is legal. We are showing on the airway bill that there is an extra charge which will be dropped when the price of fuel comes down again. We are still in discussion with the CAD about what happens next,"" Berweger said. The 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo surcharge was informally agreed by some carriers earlier this month to compensate for jet fuel prices which they said had leapt by around 50 per cent between July and October. The Hong Kong Shippers' Council, an umbrella organisation representing trade bodies, freight forwarders and business leaders, protested to the Government that any surcharge is illegal unless it is first approved by the Civil Aviation Department. A department spokeswoman said they had investigated the issue and sent a warning letter to airlines reminding them that permission to impose a surcharge must be obtained first. Alitalia, KLM, Martinair and Cargolux said they quickly heeded the warning. ""We have withdrawn the surcharge after the warning. Instead we are putting up our rate to compensate for the much higher cost of fuel,"" said a spokesman for Alitalia cargo in Hong Kong. No details of such an increase have yet been published. A spokesman for Dutch cargo airline Martinair said it would abide by the proper procedure and also withdraw the surcharge. But he said rates may be increased to compensate. A Cargolux spokesman said the situation was confusing but it had agreed to also withdraw the surcharge. Hong Kong Shippers' Council Executive Director Clement Yeung said he was pleased the surcharge had been mainly withdrawn but the situation is ""certainly confusing."" ""Some airlines are sticking to their guns but we believe that they should go by the book. Imposing surcharges sets a precedent which we do not want to see. If airlines now want to raise their published rates instead then we cannot complain about that,"" Yeung said. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"Australian cinema operator Hoyts Cinema Ltd reported on Wednesday a half year net profit in line with expectations and announced further expansion plans in Latin America by entering the Chilean cinema market. Hoyts said it made a net profit of A$13.1 million for the six months to December 31 and that it was confident of achieving its net profit forecast of A$22 million for the 1996/97 year. Hoyts chief executive Peter Ivany said the first half result was largely helped by its screening of ""Independence Day"" a film about an aliens attack on Earth.   ""The results are pleasing and in line with our prospectus forecast,"" Ivany said. ""As indicated in the prospectus, we expect to declare an interim dividend of four cents in July 1997 and a final four cent dividend in November 1997."" ""We are very confident we can meet the forecasts,"" Ivany told reporters after the release of the results. Hoyts, which currently operates cinema screens in Australia, New Zealand, United States and Mexico, unveiled further expansion plans with a move into Chile, where it plans to operate 42 screens in the capital Santiago.   Ivany said Hoyts had spent the past 18 months researching countries where cinema exhibition markets were underderveloped. ""Chile represents one of these underdeveloped markets."" He said Hoyts planned to spend A$47 million on further expansion in Latin America over the next four to five years. Ivany said Hoyts was looking at another market in Latin America and had an office in Brussels where it was assessing its European strategy. He said Hoyts planned to open another 270 screens by the end of calendar 1997, bringing the total number of screens to be operated by the group to 1,400 by the end of the year.   Ivany said the funds spent on expansion would depend on how many countries Hoyts entered. ""At the moment we have a plan to be in 10 markets over the next 10 years."" ""A$500 million is what we orginally have indicated and after we went out to the market it got closer to A$600 million,"" said Ivany in reponse to a question on how much Hoyts will spend on expansion over the next five years. Ivany said about 80 percent of the A$600 million is expected to be spent on its existing markets, mainly in the United States and Australia with the balance to be spent on new markets.   He said Hoyts would look at the international operations of U.S. cinema operator United Artists Theatre Circuit if they became available. ""If United Artists were in a position where they formally looked to sell some parts of their businesses, then if they declare that publicly and, they haven't, then we would look at it,"" Ivany said. United Artists owners, Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc and Tele-Communications Inc, have not said the company or any of its businesses are for sale.   ""Our financial structure is amongst the top in the industry and we have the flexibility to be able to take up opportunities as they come along,"" Ivany said. Hoyts is 47.5 percent owned by U.S.-based investment group Hellman and Friedman Capital. However, the result and the expansion plans failed to excite the market.

"Apple Computer Inc. said Tuesday it plans to release an operating system that will work on personal computers based on chips from Intel Corp. as well as on Apple computers. At its annual developer conference, the company also said it will release programming tools in the next few months that will allow companies to write software for Apple computers once and automatically convert their products to run on PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software. The radical strategy is part of Apple's plan to keep software companies from abandoning Apple products, Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio told a crowd of 1,900 programmers here. ""For those of you who seek substantial business on both the Mac and Windows platforms, this new development environment holds tremendous promise,"" Amelio said. ""You can (write your applications once) and with a simple recompilation release them for both platforms."" Until now, Apple has released operating system software that runs only on Apple-designed hardware. Amelio said Apple's next-generation operating system, code-named Rhapsody, will run on Apple-designed computers, and on PCs based on Intel chips. ""It's a really good idea if they can deliver,"" said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, analyst at market researcher International Data Corp. By entering the PC market, Apple will have a great opportunity to show the world that its technology is special, Zwetchkenbaum said. For the past two years, Apple has been scrambling to come up with improvements to the Macintosh that would set it apart from PCs. Until 1995, Apple had relied on its computers' famed ease-of-use as a selling point, but Microsoft's release of Windows 95 took away much of the impact of Apple's pitch. Last year, Apple gave up on a mired effort to revamp the Macintosh Operating System, the fundamental program that gives the Mac its look. In December, the company bought Next Software Inc. to get its software overhaul going again, and to use Next software as the foundation of a next-generation operating system. The move concerned lots of programmers, though, because of fears that the new operating system would not run the products they designed for the older Mac operating system. Programmers also were not thrilled to develop products for yet another operating system. Apple plans to spend the rest of this week convincing programmers that it is a worthwhile investment to write software for Rhapsody from now on. Programs written specifically for Rhapsody can easily be converted to run on old Macs, as well as a new class of Apple machines using the Rhapsody operating system, and PCs running the Windows operating system, Amelio promised. Until now, Mac programmers who wanted to write a version of their product for Intel machines had to make huge changes to their programs. The first versions of Rhapsody will be delivered later this year, Amelio said. Still, Apple faces a big challenge moving Mac developers to Rhapsody, Zwetchenbaum said. Switching to a new operating system involves learning lots of technical details. Apple's stock closed unchanged at $17.56 on Nasdaq. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"British pay television operator BSkyB said on Wednesday that it believed its planned 200-channel digital satellite service would prove a hit with viewers. BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay TV, confirmed that it would proceed later this year with the launch of digital satellite into this country. It said that the plan was not affected by its new digital terrestrial television (DTT) alliance with leading commercial broadcasters Carlton Communications and Granada Group . The three have teamed up to form British Digital Broadcasting and apply for licences to run DTT networks when the 30-channel service comes on air in Britain in mid-1998. ""BSkyB is positioning itself to become a key player in digital,"" chief executive Sam Chisholm told a news conference. ""Digital satellite is going to be the primary driver (of the new technology) as it offers such a wide range of services,"" Chisholm added. BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, earlier said pre-tax profit rose 26 percent to 133.7 million pounds ($214.4 million) in the six months to end-December, up from 106.3 million a year ago. It reported record subscriber growth of 434,000 in the last three months of last year and now has over six million customers in Britain and Ireland. BSkyB shares continued their surge of recent days as markets welcomed the digital developments. BSkyB closed 29.5p higher at 622.5p, its best level for over three months. BSkyB said it expected shortly to confirm an order for up to one million digital satellite decoders from four manufacturers as it gears up for an autumn launch. It plans to work with partners to offer interactive services such as home shopping and home banking as part of the digital satellite package. Chisholm said a new company would be formed to subsidise the digital satellite decoder so that it could retail for around 200 pounds. A decoder is needed to view any digital service. He did not name the members of the company, but BSkyB is reported to have had talks with British Telecommunications, Japanese electronics company Matsushita and bankers HSBC. BSkyB remained optimistic about the prospects for digital television in Germany, playing down the initial slow take-up recorded by Kirch Gruppe's DF1. ""If you can get it right, it's a hell of an opportunity,"" said Chisholm, noting that there are some 37 million German-speaking households in Europe. BSkyB agreed last year to take a stake of up to 49 percent in DF1 but is yet to invest any money in the venture. DF1 was launched last July but recent reports suggest it has only attracted 20,000 subscribers. Chisholm said that DF1's slow take-up was partly the result of market confusion. DF1 has been locked in a war with Premiere, another German pay-TV venture. Kirch owns 25 percent of Premiere but has fallen out with partners Bertelsmann and Canal Plus, who hold the remaining 75 percent. Bertelsmann and Canal Plus want to develop Premiere into Germany's main digital television outlet but Kirch is backing its own DF1 for that role. ($1=.6237 Pound) ","KeithWeir"
"Hong Kong's Finance Secretary Donald Tsang, set to unveil the annual budget under China's watchful eye, is a man of conservative pedigree when it comes to economics but an outspoken liberal in the political arena. Tsang, who appears in hallmark striped business shirts and colourful bow-ties, broke a 153-year colonial mould by becoming Hong Kong's first non-British financial secretary in 1995, crowning a 30-year career in the civil service. So far, he has made no stunning changes to the cautious budget policies that have made Hong Kong rich, a posture that should endear him to Hong Kong's soon-to-be sovereign power, China. The 52-year-old staunch Roman Catholic minces no words when he advertises his cautious, conservative economic approach. ""My policy is not to create excitement in the management of our public finances, nor do I have any appetite for thrills and spills,"" Tsang said when he took on the job. Last week Tsang dismissed accusations that the government was acting like a miser sitting on a cash mountain while holding back welfare spending. But he was also quick to dismiss accusations that China, due to take back the territory from Britain on July 1, had put the brakes on social spending. ""In formulating our expenditure programme we had not been overly influenced, we have not been affected, by whatever they call political pressure,"" he told a meeting of central bankers. The budget to be unveiled on Wednesday has for the first time been worked out in hand with Chinese experts. It was part of the Sino-British negotiations on details of the sovereignty change, and came against the political backdrop of sour relations between London and Beijing. Since he delivered his maiden budget a year ago, Tsang has landed himself in political controversy. He has spoken out against China's plans to roll back key clauses in some of Hong Kong's civil liberties laws -- putting himself at odds with Hong Kong's future leader. ""If you can't convince the people of Hong Kong, people may take to the streets, some may keep their frustration in their hearts, some in the civil service may quit. Some may emigrate. ""Investors are similar. They talk about substance (of the laws). If they are happy with it, they will invest more. If they aren't, they will leave,"" Tsang said in a newspaper interview. A recent newspaper report said leader-to-be Tung Chee-hwa, who has retained Tsang for the post-colonial government, now plans to sack him because he had upset China. Tsang has declined to comment on the report. In the 1997/98 budget, Tsang has made one departure from past practice by announcing some of the key data in advance. But he has not commented on experts' predictions of a fiscal surplus of as much as HK$25 billion, far higher than the government's previous forecast of HK$1.6 billion. Hong Kong-born Tsang sits atop one of the world's richest low-tax economies. In gross domestic product terms, it is equal to one-fifth of China's economy, though Hong Kong has only 6.4 million people to China's 1.2 billion. At US$66 billion, Hong Kong has the second highest foreign exchange reserves per head on the planet, and it is the globe's eighth-largest trading economy. ","PeterHumphrey"
"A bill to protect homeowners from paying unneccessary mortgage insurance was passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representative Wednesday. By a vote of 421 to seven, the House adopted the Homeowners Insurance Protection Act that would cancel mortgage insurance once the homeowner has built up sufficient equity. ""The truth is that a vast number of people are paying for insurance they no longer need,"" Representative Henry Gonzalez said during the debate on the bill. The Texas Democrat urged the Senate to quickly pass the measure. Consumer advocates say these policies cost homeowners millions of dollars a year. ""I think it would be hard for the Senate to resist moving forward,"" Michelle Meier, counsel for government affairs at Consumers Union, said. The House vote ""brings us really close to getting a final measure."" But the mortgage insurance industry warned that the automatic cancellation proposal would raise the cost for loans with low downpayments. ""Unfortunately, the bill has serious flaws that would impose unnecessary government mandates and controls on the industry,"" said Suzanne Hutchinson of the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America. Currently, mortgage lenders require a borrower to obtain and pay for such insurance when the borrower is making a relatively small down payment, such as 5 percent of the purchase price of a home. Borrowers putting down 20 percent or more of the purchase price generally are not required to obtain insurance, which can cost $300 to $900 a year. The bill would automatically cancel a mortgage insurance policy if the homeowner was current on mortgage payments and had built up 25 percent equity of the original house value.

Energy Group, which is mulling a string of acquisitions in Britain and America, said it had started talks with a U.S. power marketing company. The demerger, which is subject to shareholder approval, will give shareholders one Energy share for every 10 existing Hanson shares held. Hanson shareholders will be asked to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on February 21. Once Energy is split off as a separate company, to be listed in London and New York, the rump Hanson group will consist of a clutch of building firms. ""We are all very enthusiastic about the future of Energy and new Hanson and are convinced that both will benefit from enhanced focus on operations, profitability and future growth prospects,"" chairman Lord Hanson said. The first two demergers of Britain's Imperial Tobacco and U.S.-quoted Millennium Chemicals took place last October. Energy, which will be large enough to rank inside Britain's top 100 blue chips and the Fortune 500 in the U.S., is the last to be split off. Its new management team is led by Derek Bonham, executive chairman, with two joint chief executives to run operations at the main businesses -- Peabody mining and Eastern, the British electricity division. Bonham told a press briefing the group planned to target a number of acquisitions, particularly in the U.S., and admitted entering into ""exclusive and confidential"" talks with a U.S. power marketing company, subject to due diligence. It is also examining generating deals in the U.S. and Britian, it said. Peabody chief executive Irl Engelhardt told a press briefing that the coal group could use its knowledge of the U.S. market to help Energy exploit opportunities there. Group finance director Eric Anstee said the group would ""take the cash generation of the coal and network businesses and use it where we see future growth in earnings -- the growing power sector"". Eastern generated a total of 354 million pounds ($571 million) in cash flow in the year ended September 30, he said. Energy, which owns Eastern, Britain's fourth largest electricity generator, said that worldwide demand for energy is expected to rise 34 to 46 percent between 1993 and 2010. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, world electricity output is expected to grow 63 percent to 2010. Coal and gas will account for 41 percent and 17 percent of that generation level by 2010. Energy, which is being sold with 1.4 billion pounds of debt, sees this, deregulation in world markets and privatisation as the key opportunities for the group. Investor roadshows are being planned on both sides of the Atlantic, with 35 percent of Hanson's shares held in the U.S. The group's annual turnover in the year to September 30, 1996 was 3.6 billion pounds, with pre-exceptional profits of 446 million pounds. Total assets are 5.7 billion pounds. ($1=.6199 Pound) ","EdnaFernandes"
"Lucent Technologies Inc expects its lagging consumer products unit -- the smallest of four product divsions -- to show substantial profit gains in 1997 and a return to revenue growth by the December quarter. ""We expect a substantial improvement in profitablity this year (for the unit) mainly through cost-cutting,"" Chief Financial Officer Don Peterson Peterson ""and positive revenue growth"" in the December quarter, due to new products.  Earlier Thursday, Lucent had said consumer product revenues fell 41 percent in the second quarter ended in March.   Consumer products comprised a small fraction of total March quarter revenues of $5.15 billion.  It was the only Lucent unit not to see double-digit growth in the quarter. The division's revenues fell to $174 million in the March quarter due to the impact on sales resulting from the closing in 1996 of hundreds of phone center stores, the streamlining of the product line and reduced revenue from phone rentals. Revenues from Lucent's carrier network systems division jumped 23.3 percent to $2.93 billion, while the business communications unit rose 14.1 percent to $1.3 billion and semiconductor revenues gained 18.3 percent to $615 million.   In addition, Peterson told Reuters the company's closely watched backlog of customer equipment orders remained ""in the $4 billion range, or about the same level it was in the fiscal first quarter ended in December 1996."" ""The backlog was about the same level that we talked about in the prior quarter's conference call,"" Peterson said. He said the backlog was replenished by about $600 million in new wireless equipment orders in Taiwan, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines and Mexico balancing out the revenue recognized from prior equipment contracts during the quarter.   The Lucent executive said he expected the company to maintain its gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues at around 42 to 43 percent for the fiscal 1997 year ending in September. For the March quarter, Lucent reported an overall gross margin of 42.1 percent, down from the 45.9 percent reported in the seasonally strong volume December 1996 quarter but up from the 39.9 percent margin in the year-ago March quarter. ""I don't see margin expansion as a major opportunity, but I do think we can hold onto it if we run the business right,"" he said of plans to hold margins at 43 percent in fiscal 1997.   Peterson said international revenues increased 26 percent over the year-ago quarter to $1.26 billion from $1.0 billion. Because most large equipment contracts are transacted in U.S. dollars, he said the impact of currency translation on Lucent results was immaterial during the latest quarter and was expected to have minimal impact for the rest of the year. Speaking of plans to pump up consumer product revenues, he said the company plans to introduce a slew of new products including wireless, cordless and corded phones and answering machines to replace older models.   After a round of profit-taking in the morning that sent Lucent shares down 5/8 of a point, the stock recovered in mid-afternoon trading to 54-7/8, up 1/4 of a point on the day.

"GTE Corp on Wednesday said it had 800,000 long distance customers at the end of 1996, six percent above the target of 750,000 it set itself after it entering the $80 billion long distance market last March. GTE gave the new figures in a press release announcing a new flat rate long distance calling plan. It said by the end of this quarter it may up customer targets for 1997, and pull forward the unit's expected break-even target. ""We are evaluating that on a daily basis,"" Rob McCoy, president of GTE long distance, told Reuters in an interview.   McCoy did not give the current target for end-1997 customers. The unit is currently expected to break-even by the last quarter of 1998 with a full year profit contribution to the parent company for 1999. GTE is targeting customers who would spend an average $25 a month on long distance. McCoy said bills were at present above $17 reaching towards $20, adding they would rise further as more users emerged from the first few weeks of promotional service. ""We have had some terrific success in our first 10 months,"" McCoy said.   GTE is approaching the ferociously competitive market cautiously, picking at customers in niches who may switch to the company and stay. Switching and not staying -- called churn in industry jargon -- has been the bane of the industry. The new ""GTE's Easy One Rate"" plan is aimed at users who want simplicity, and those who make a lot of daytime long distance calls. Several providers offer cheaper off-peak rates than GTE's $0.14 per minute. ""We don't have a mass market strategy,"" McCoy said. GTE is only initially offering the calling plan in 27 states where it already offers local or wireless services.   The idea is to build a customer base which uses a bundle of services and -- according to business models and market research -- will be less likely to switch carrier than those who only take one service. GTE has set up a rate plan customer line, 1-800-GTE-3737, and will monitor which areas among the other 23 states where it offers long distance have high demand. This will help it determine where to expand the rate plan, McCoy said.   GTE's next market niches to attack will include markets for ethnic minorities. This may bundle international calling to the country of origin with multilingual customer service and other services needed in that community marketplace. ""It will be coupled with marketing best able to reach those marketplaces,"" he said. McCoy said that GTE's long distance unit would shortly be announcing a business data network resale deal with one of the big three long distance carriers, AT&amp;T Corp, MCI Communications Corp or Sprint Corp. He declined to say which. GTE resells the network of WorldCom Inc for its basic long distance, so its increased customer tally will also benefit that carrier as the number of network minutes bought rises.

"San Jose was a bustling mountain village in this northwest region of Colombia until a dreaded right-wing death squad passed through a few weeks ago and ordered everyone to leave. The 40-strong paramilitary gang shut down the weekly market and forbade shopkeepers from selling all but small quantities of food, fearing the village was a supply post for leftist guerrillas. Just to push the point home they dragged off four villagers, riddled them with bullets and threw their corpses into a shallow grave. Today, San Jose is a virtual ghost town. Only 11 families defied the marching order while most gathered up what few belongings they could carry and fled. ""They told us to leave but maybe it's better to wait to die here in our homes and not go elsewhere and die of hunger,"" said peasant farmer Dario Alvarez. The tragedy of San Jose is mirrored in scores of other remote villages and communities in the central region of Uraba -- the so-called banana belt -- which has been thrust into the eye of a hurricane as right-wing paramilitaries seek to destroy pockets of suspected rebel activity. FOUR-WAY BATTLE FOR CONTROL For the last decade, guerrillas, paramilitaries, the army and banana companies have been battling for political and economic control of Uraba, a region with huge natural wealth strategically located around an enormous natural bay close to Colombia's border with Panama. The Saturday market in San Jose, 7 miles (12 km) from the regional centre of Apartado, was traditionally a magnet for hundreds of peasants from the surrounding Serrania de Abibe mountains seeking to sell avocados, cocoa and plantains. Now the village square is deserted and 76-year-old Jose Joaquin Barrera sits at a stall unable to sell his wares to the few people that remain. ""The men that came were very heavily armed. They took off friends and people we knew well. By the time I got to the square they were just dragging them off. But what can you do? It's sad, very sad and leaves you with a lot of pain,"" he said. Police believe the murders and threats carried out by the paramilitary gang in San Jose were in retailation for a massive car bomb attack in Apartado which killed 11 people and injured at least 60 others two days earlier. The blast was blamed on the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Colombia's oldest and largest rebel group set up as a pro-Soviet force in 1964. The army, which some critics accuse of backing the paramilitaries, describes San Jose as a village ""under the total control of the FARC"" and claims uniformed rebels openly patrol the central square. EVEN A PRIEST IS SUSPECTED Anybody spotted making the journey along a rough dirt road is suspected of ties to the guerrillas -- even the parish priest. ""The priest has an excellent excuse -- that he's a priest and must attend to the faithful,"" said Col. Mario Correa, of the 17th Brigade based in nearby Carepa. There is no apparent sign of rebel activity in San Jose, although a church worker, who did not wish to be named, said both guerrillas and paramilitaries regularly set up road blocks on the outskirts of the village. Peasants say the sight of armed groups criss-crossing the hillsides is common. But giving out a glass of water or a handful of beans is considered more a means of survival than collaboration with the enemy. ""The person who has the gun is the law for the poor peasant. A lot of people pass through -- we just don't ask where they've come from nor where they're going ... this is a very dirty thing,"" said a 60-year-old peasant, who did not wish to be named. More than 110 families have abandoned San Jose since the first paramilitary group appeared there six months ago. Some moved to Apartado, others used their scant funds to get as far away as they could. In one of the newest squatter colonies in Apartado, called 20 De Enero, dozens of children play amid the wood shacks and hastily dug open drains. ""When I left I just took what I could carry. I don't really spend anything on food, just what I find. A plantain, a bit of yucca. Beans are too expensive at 1,000 pesos ($1) a pound. I don't see any hope,"" said a mother of two who fled six months ago after an army helicopter strafed her home in a community a day's walk away. ""Somebody once came and gave us a sheet of zinc for the roof but we haven't really had what you can call government help,"" said neighbour Nicolasa Goez, 72, who lives with her blind grandson. Local authorities estimate at least 7,000 people have been displaced by violence throughout the region. Government organisations calculate some 920,000 people have been displaced by the long-running guerrilla war across Colombia. ""The problem of the displaced will cause us huge problems of crime, prostitution and social breakdown in the medium term. It makes me shudder,"" said Maria Girlesa Villegas of the human rights ombudsmen's office in Apartado. ","KarlPenhaul"
"Forestry giant Weyerhaeuser Co. Wednesday reported sharply lower fourth-quarter earnings, capping a year of mixed results dragged down by pulp and paper prices. Several other timber industry companies also reported comparatively weak fourth-quarter results blamed on poor market conditions. For the fourth quarter Weyerhaeuser posted earnings of $98 million or 50 cents a share, compared with $251 million or $1.25 a share a year earlier. Revenues in the quarter fell to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion. The earnings figure was above the Wall Street consensus of 48 cents a share mainly because of strong operating earnings in the company's real estate business, analysts said. But Weyerhaeuser closed off $1 at $49.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. For the year Weyerhaeuser, based in Federal Way, Wash., reported net income of $463 million or $2.34 a share, down from $983 million or $4.83 a share before a special charge in 1995.  Revenues for the year fell to $11.1 billion from $11.8 billion. ""1996 was a year of mixed results,""  said John Creighton, Weyerhaeuser president and chief executive officer, who cited lower pulp and paper prices but ""solid demand"" for wood products in the United States and Japan. Pulp and paper operating earnings for the year fell to $307 million from a record $1.18 billion in 1995. Earnings from timberlands and wood products were virtually flat at $805 million, compared with $808 million. Portland, Ore.-based Louisiana-Pacific Corp. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $14.7 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $567 million, compared with net income of $26.8 million or 25 cents a share on sales of $670.3 million a year earlier. For the year the company reported a net loss of $201 million, or $1.87 a share, blamed mainly on a pre-tax charge of $350 million for the closing of its pulp mill in Ketchikan, Alaska. In 1995 the company had a loss of $51.7 million or 48 cents a share including a pretax charge of $366.6 million mainly to account for the settlement of class-action lawsuits over the company's siding. Louisiana-Pacific chairman and chief executive officer Mark Suwyn said the company had resolved key legal and organisational issues in 1996 but still faced an oversupply in the market for its key product of oriented strand board, used in building. Louisiana-Pacific stock closed up 25 cents at $21. Clayton, Mo.-based Jefferson Smurfit Corp. posted net income of $14 million, or 13 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, down from $64 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were $816 million, compared with $973 million. For the full year the company earned $112 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $243 million, or $2.19 a share. Sales fell to $3.4 billion from $4.1 billion in 1995. Company president and chief executive officer Richard Graham said inventories in containerboard and newsprint have declined steadily over the past several months, promising some relief to the weak pricing environment. ""Given continued economic expansion, we could see a recovery in the company's principal markets during the second half of 1997,"" he said. Jefferson Smurfit fell 43.75 cents to close at $15.06 on Nasdaq. ","MartinWolk"
"Czech consumer prices rose by what some analysts considered a surprisingly low 0.2 percent in August, after 1.0 percent in July, to put prices 9.6 percent up on the same month in 1995. The result surprised analysts although it kept average inflation well over the government's 1996 target of eight percent. Radek Maly, an economist with Citibank in Prague, said: ""It is very low, I expected the month-on month inflation to be over 0.6 percent, and the year-on-year figure to get over ten percent."" The Statistical Bureau (CSU) said a hike in regulated natural gas and power prices sparked a 3.2 percent month-on-month increase in housing prices, the main impetus for August inflation. Food, beverages and tobacco products actually showed a price drop in August of 1.4 percent, thanks to a 29.5 percent fall in potato prices and 25.9 percent decrease of vegetables. ""What was totally surprising to me was the fall in the foods index, and considering its (large) weighting, it obviously pulled the whole figure down. The whole structure looks very well,"" Maly said. The CSU in July raised its average inflation forecast for the whole year to 9.0 percent, and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the cabinet based its 1997 budget calculations on an inflation expectation of ""not below"" eight percent. Klaus did not specify if he meant the year-on-year or the moving average rate. Maly said the August result might help the 1996 figure to finish below nine percent, but nowhere near the government's earlier target. The government has said it would aim to cut inflation by one percentage point every year after 1995's rate of nine percent. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"Sun Microsystems Inc on Wednesday unveiled its first mainframe-class server, marking its entry into a $50 billion market for data-center computer hardware, storage, software and services. Ed Zander, president of the company's Sun Microsystems Computer Co, said he expected the machines to sell for an average price of more than $1 million.   Speaking to a a gathering of analysts, customers and reporters at San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art, Zander cautioned that the new Ultra Enterprise 10000 servers, which can compete with mainframe computers on many measurements of computing performance, would have a longer sales cycle than Sun's more traditional Unix product lines. Still, he said Sun expected to sell more of its speedy Ultra Enterprise 5000 and 6000 midrange servers as a result of its new high-end machine, which is available immediately to launch customers. It will begin shipping in volume in March.   ""It really puts Sun into some new markets where they have not been able to play before,"" said C.B. Lee, senior analyst at Sutro &amp; Co. Lee said the new server would be most useful for running complex database applications and for extending new computing capabilities, rather than replacing older software and hardware that have come to be known as legacy systems.   Montgomery Securities analyst Kurt King said by extending Sun's capabilities at the high end, the new machines may help overall investor sentiment by allaying somewhat the fears of competition at the lower end of Sun's product line from PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Windows. ""It expands Sun's business,"" he said, adding it would inevitably help boost margins and help move the mix toward servers and away from the Unix workstation market. Sun dominates that market but Intel and Windows NT are challenging its lead. The base Starfire configuration -- 16 processors and two gigabytes of memory -- will be priced around $870,000.   Sun officials declined to comment specifically on margin and revenue or earnings expectations, although John Shoemaker, who heads Sun's enterprise server and storage group, repeated that Sun aimed to become the leading midrange server supplier. It is currently third behind International Business Machines Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co, analysts said. Shoemaker said Sun estimated its rate of growth to be two to three times that of its archrivals, however. ""We think we have a realistic objective in about three years to be number one,"" he said. ""We are significantly gaining share on our competitors.""   Sun said its 10000 series, codenamed 'Starfire', offers up to four times the performance of IBM's CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) mainframe and HP T-series servers. Zander said the company's sales force would market the machines aggressively. ""This is a hunk of Iron,"" he said after the machine was brought onto stage using a turntable. ""Bring back the old days -- gross margin, revenue,"" he said. Because it runs Sun's Solaris version of Unix, the 10000 series also can run 12,000 Solaris-based applications. Shares of Sun fell 68 cents to $32.75 in Nasdaq trade.   Sun also announced storage products, including its RSM Array 2000, which supports up to 20 terabytes for the 10000. It will begin shipping in February for Solaris servers. The RSM Array 2000 is priced at $0.49 per megabyte, sharply lower than the $1.75 per megabyte and $1.08 per megabyte it said new EMC machines cost. Sun said it would offer Veritas Software Corp's Veritas File System disk and information management system with its storage products, and it demonstrated it on the RSM Array 2000. Mountain View-based Veritas jumped $6.75 to $51. -- Sam.Perry@Reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau +1 415 846 5400 ","SamuelPerry"
"Britain's largest life insurance group Prudential Corp said on Wednesday it is to increase its exposure to the top end of the personal financial services market by taking a near 30 percent stake in St James's Place Capital. The move coincides with news that St James' is seeking to buy the 49 percent of life insurer J. Rothschild Assurance (JRA) it does not already own and comes hot on the heels of the Pru's purchase of mutual insurer Scottish Amicable two weeks ago. It is the attraction of JRA, set up by St James's co-founder Sir Mark Weinberg in 1992, and its upmarket clientele which lies behind the Pru's interest in St James's. JRA targets high net-worth individuals, managing some 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) for its near 200,000 policyholders. In 1996, the company announced a 41 percent growth in new business, among the highest in the industry. Despite assurances from the Pru that it would respect JRA's wishes to stay independent, any future takeover of it or St.James would represent a neat hat-trick for Weinberg. In the 1960s he founded insurance firm Abbey Life, which he later sold to Lloyds Bank. He then set up Allied Dunbar, eventually selling that to B.A.T Industries. However, the Pru has agreed not to increase its holding in St James's for at least a year, unless the company attracts a bid from a third party. That undertaking was described as ""fundamental"" to the deal by Mike Wilson chief executive of JRA. The Pru will pay around 39.6 million pounds for 30.5 million St James's shares, to add to the 10.4 million shares it already owns. Scottish Amicable holds approximately 20 percent of JRA which after conversion into St James shares will give the Pru control of 118.8 million shares or 29.9 percent. ""Something had to happen to sort out the interest the Pru acquired through ScotAm. This looks an elegant intermediate step but may not be the final solution,"" said one industry analyst. The move gave the Pru strategic options, he said and a purchase of JRA further down the line would not conflict with its existing Prudential or Scottish Amicable brands. ""The value would be in keeping it separate. It's a fairly unique organisation and the Pru's chief executive Peter Davis has said in the past that there's nothing wrong with operating separate brands."" St James said it believed the plans would enable JRA to achieve more rapid growth through improved incentives for the sales force and a simplification of the management structure. Plans to float JRA on the stock market, possibly as early as this summer, have been shelved. Wilson said today's proposals would result in the same benefits for shareholders but at an earlier stage than would otherwise have been possible. JRA contributed 11 million pounds towards St James' after tax profits from continuing operations of 25.1 million pounds in the nine months to December 31, 1996, up from 5.5 million pounds for the whole of the previous year. St James said it believed JRA, with its high quality, focused distribution and strong brand name was well placed to take advantage of current developments in the industry. Lord Rothschild who co-founded St James's with Weinberg, sold half his family's stake for 13.8 million pounds last October following his decision to step down as joint chairman after the group's reconstruction in the summer. St James's also owns Life Assurance Holding Corp which specialises in the acquisition and management of closed life assurance policies and Global Asset Management, a specialist fund management company.

"The proposed $6.6 billion acquisition of modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp. by computer network equipment manufacturer 3Com Corp. triggered a drop Thursday in the stocks of 3Com, U.S. Robotics and other major network companies. Santa Clara, Calif.-based 3Com's stock fell $4 to $35 and was the most heavily traded issue on Nasdaq, with more than 40 million shares changing hands. U.S. Robotics dropped $1.875 to $59.125, also on Nasdaq, and was the second-most active share. Analysts said the proposed stock swap unveiled Wednesday undervalued Skokie, Ill.-based U.S. Robotics, the world's leading maker of computer modems for the consumer market. ""I think U.S. Robotics shareholders are being robbed,"" said Donaldson Lufkin analyst Eric Buck, who harshly criticised the terms of the deal. Several analysts said the offer -- involving stock and options valued at $7.3 billion in all -- put a low-ball value on U.S. Robotics of 20 times annual earnings vs. its historic multiple of 25. ""If anything, this deal is more of a take-under than a takeover,"" Salomon analyst Peter Swartz said of the 3Com deal. ""Both stocks are down 50 percent from their highs."" Swartz noted that many network stocks are trading at historic lows. The merger, if approved by shareholders and government regulators, would create a combined company with $5 billion in annual revenues and 12,000 employees -- second only to leader Cisco Systems Inc. with more than $6 billion in annual revenues. The merger also comes as the Internet and other computer networks continue to grow in importance. Analysts said the deal put pressure on other network equipment players to use their shares to fund major acquisitions of their own. ""We believe the competitive landscape of the networking sector is undergoing a fundamental restructuring,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Bill Rabin said in published comments. ""Other networking vendors will have to combine or be bought."" Along with 3Com and U.S. Robotics, network company stocks were among the most actively traded on Nasdaq Thursday. Cisco Systems fell $3.06 to $55.06, Ascend Communications Inc. dropped $5.375 to $57, and Cascade Communications Corp. slipped $2.50 to $30.125. Still, Rabin reiterated ""buy"" ratings on four stocks in the sector, while maintaining his ""market perform"" rating on 3Com. Swartz also kept his ""buy"" rating and recommended investors buy 3Com shares while the price is low. The main beneficiaries of the 3Com-Robotics deal appeared to be Bay Networks Inc. and Shiva Corp. -- two stocks that have sat in the doghouse for some time -- based on their potential as acquisition targets, analysts said. Shiva rose 62.5 cents to $15.875 on Nasdaq, recovering from its historic low, while Bay added 12.5 cents to $19.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. ""The merger forces other players in the industry to ante up to play in this bigger game,"" said Steve Harmon, an independent financial analyst who publishes the Internet Stock Report. ""It forces equipment makers to look for end-to-end solutions supplying network products to both businesses and consumers,"" he said, referring to how the 3Com-Robotics merger would allow the combined company to compete in both markets. The pressure to do deals adds to the burdens already weighing on the computer network industry, analysts said. Earnings shortfalls or close calls, fears of slowing industry growth and cautionary comments from 3Com, Cascade and Shiva have triggered fears about the whole sector, Rabin said. In addition, technology changes in the industry and the growing threat of competition from outsiders like chip makers Intel Corp. and Rockwell International Corp. have dimmed the outlook for the industry as a whole. Some analysts cited fears that Intel may decide to integrate network adapter cards or modem chips directly into the computer chassis it builds, rendering stand-alone products from many network suppliers a commodity -- if not obsolete.

"The French government called off the controversial sale of electronics group Thomson SA Wednesday in a major policy reversal after weeks of staunchly defending its controversial choice of a buyer. It was the second privatisation to be halted in less than a month after the government decided to suspend the sale of a state-owned bank. It comes at a time when Prime Minister Alain Juppe, at a record low in opinion polls, is anxious to avoid another labour revolt following last month's truckers strike. The Finance Ministry said in a statement the suspension of the proposed Thomson sell-off to Lagardere Groupe was due to objections to the planned sale of the company's consumer electronics unit to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics. Lagardere said in a statement it was still interested in taking over Thomson, which it said was of strategic importance. The office of Prime Minister Alain Juppe said renewed talks about the sale could start soon. ""The government will launch consultations as rapidly as possible allowing the privatisation to take place on a basis that will be defined very quickly,"" Juppe was quoted as saying. ""The aim of privatising Thomson addresses the necessity for France to have an electronics and defence industry of global standing,"" he said. Industry Minister Franck Borotra said in a statement the privatisation of Thomson remained essential. The government said in October it had selected Lagardere Groupe because it was best for French defence interests and would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc after a 10.8 billion franc ($2 billion) state capital injection. Lagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58 percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its own Matra Defence Espace. The Finance Ministry's surprise suspension announcement came on the day the European Commission had been expected to give the green light to the deal. The ministry said the Privatisation Commission ""declared itself incapable of giving a favourable opinion to the Lagardere Groupe offer, because of the terms of Daewoo Electronics' purchase of Thomson Multimedia.""

"Australian paper and packing group Amcor Ltd is expected on Thursday to report a sharp fall in half-year profit after a tumble in world paper prices. Stock analysts have on average forecast the company to post a net profit before abnormals of about A$145 million for the six months ended December 31, a fund manager told Reuters. The average forecast compares with a result of A$213.5 million for the same period a year earlier, when paper prices soared, but is broadly in line with the previous half-year.   ""In the second half of last year (1995/96), they made A$142 million and really that's what people are looking for,"" a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters. Paper prices, which impact heavily on Amcor's earnings, touched historic highs towards late calendar 1995 but came back to earth last year. ""Paper prices have probably fallen on average by around 25 to 30 percent,"" Macquarie Equities analyst Philip King said. ""They probably hit their bottom in the June quarter of 1996 and since then they have been pretty flat,"" he told Reuters.   Sluggish economic growth at home and abroad as well as stiff competition in Amcor's packaging businesses in Australia and New Zealand also kept a lid on half-year earnings, analysts said. The group's container packaging and fibre packaging divisions accounted for over half of Amcor's earnings before interest and tax in 1995/96. Both would report a slight fall in earnings for the half-year, against a year ago, analysts said. Amcor's loss-making Holfelder fibre-packaging business in Germany was again expected to detract from the group's half-year result, they said.   Amcor had begun a cost-cutting drive at the German box-maker and says it would approach break-even in 1996/97. But the paper division would shoulder most of the expected fall in half-year earnings, analysts said. Its profit could be roughly half the A$173 million it earned before interest and tax in the first half-year of 1995/96, the fund manager said. The silver lining in Amcor's result should be its outlook, which analysts described as positive.   Domestic and world economic growth was set to underpin stronger earnings in 1997/98, with some signs of improvement evident already, they said. One analyst warned of a risk that paper price would show renewed weakness, but others saw prices firming and margins fattening in the packaging businesses in 1997/98. ""For some significant improvement you have to look at '98...,"" the Sydney analyst said. -- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421 ","MarkBendeich"
"British soldiers fought their way through jungle, attacked an enemy camp and took prisoners in Hong Kong on Tuesday, but it was only a mock battle and the last such exercise by the army after 156 years of colonial rule. With only 70 days left before Britain hands Hong Kong back to China, the Black Watch regiment headed to the hills of the New Territories to play jungle war games and ignore, for a few hours, the fast-approaching end of British rule. Shots ripped through the air and red flares spewed smoke as sweat-drenched soldiers laden with gear waded across rivers, charged up and down hills and crawled through lush and heavy undergrowth in a practice assault on an enemy camp. The Black Watch -- dubbed the ""Highland Furies"" by the French after the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 -- are nearly half-way through an historic tour of duty in Hong Kong. On June 30, the pipes and drums of the regiment will sound the end of British colonial rule. But on Tuesday, sweat and slog rather than ceremony was the order of the day. The camp and two prisoners-of-war were successfully taken, marking the end to the British army's permanent access to a valued training ground for jungle warfare skills. ""I'll miss it. We'll miss it, because you don't get training like this on a regular basis on a tour,"" said Corporal John Lyon, 28. ""This area you can train throughout the whole time you're here."" Lieutenant-Colonel Alasdair Loudon, commanding officer of the Black Watch in Hong Kong, said the New Territories have become something of a secret weapon. Few would guess that less than one-hour's drive from the concrete jungle of Hong Kong Island lie stretches of hot, humid and heavily overgrown countryside which represents a challenge for British troops. ""For us, it's harsh terrain. We're not used to the heat, we're not used to the hills and when you get away from tracks the undergrowth is very difficult. So it's demanding,"" he said. The Black Watch also had a busy day on Monday -- they were escorting an advance party of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers as they drove from the border to the Prince of Wales barracks in the territory's Central business district. The 40-strong PLA party are to lay the ground for up to 10,000 Chinese troops likely to be stationed in Hong Kong after the handover. Loudon said his regiment's main task as June 30 approaches is to ensure the handover goes smoothly. ""Our most important task is to get out on June 30 and have a fine parade so that the handover of British sovereignty has gone in a smooth and dignified way,"" he told reporters. At least 100 of the Black Watch soldiers will be involved in the ceremonies with another 100 providing logistical support. The regiment flies back to Inverness in northern Scotland after the ceremonies. ""To a man, they will have had a very interesting time here. They will have done some good training, they've done a good job,"" Loudon said. ""And I'm sure when they get back to Inverness, where it's warm only two days a year, they're going to miss Hong Kong very much,"" he said. ","SarahDavison"
"U.S. mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. has extended its review of a controversial Indonesian gold mining project until June 30, Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. said Wednesday. New Orleans-based Freeport, a partner in the Busang project in Indonesia, requested the extension ""to allow for consideration of the findings of the Strathcona audit,"" Bre-X said in a statement. Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. is expected to deliver a key report on Busang to Bre-X on Thursday or Friday. Bre-X has said it will issue a press release on the report before North American financial markets open on Monday. Rumours have swirled around Busang since what has been called the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when Freeport-McMoRan said its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold. Bre-X has estimated Busang contains about 71 million ounces of gold, potentially the largest in the world. Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's stock market value last month, wiping out 80 percent of its market worth. Freeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday the request for the extension was made within the past week. ""The original agreement with Bre-X signed on February 26 said that FCX's due diligence expired on April 30. This is really just to announce that we had pushed that date to June 30 to allow time for completion of the independent audit by Strathcona,"" Lemkau said in a telephone interview. Lemkau declined to comment when asked if Freeport planned any further drilling at Busang over the next two months. Bre-X shares led fell 32 cents Canadian (23 cents) to C$3.48 ($2.52) in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Some investors on an Internet chat page speculated that Freeport's extension was favourable to Bre-X, but mining analysts cautioned against reading too much into the announcement. ""I don't think we should read into the request, although obviously investors are,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc. ""Everybody is reading a lot into the rumours. But really they are just rumours right now,"" another Canadian mining analyst said. An Indonesian newspaper, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier this week that leaked results of Strathcona's drill tests showed ""cheerful"" grades of gold. But in a report in the Calgary Sun newspaper on Wednesday, Strathcona President Graham Farquharson said it was unlikely that his company's findings had been leaked. ""I still haven't seen the results myself -- the assays are still under way. So I have to doubt the claim,"" Farquharson was quoted as saying by the Sun. ""To the best of my knowledge there've been no leaks,"" he said. Strathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada, Indonesia and Australia. Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory would have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished. Strathcona has said its final report to Bre-X would be delivered about six weeks after an interim report. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"IBM Corp's Czech unit said on Monday it would appeal against a Defence Ministry decision to award a 1.3 billion crown deal to deliver an information system to a consortium of EDS and Digital Equipment Corp. IBM said in a statement that EDS-Digital did not fulfil a tender condition that stipulated participation of only those companies which have acomplished projects in the Czech Republic to a similar extent. ""There are a number of reasons why we are appealing, we are still working on it,"" said IBM's spokesman Michal Urvalek. He declined to give more information on the appeal. The IBM move comes on the heels of Unisys Corp's announcement on Thursday that it too would appeal the decision. Any appeals must be delivered to the ministry this week. IBM placed third in the eyes of an 11-member committee evaluating bidders in the tender behind, Unisys which came in first and EDS-Digital, which won the contract after the ministry decided not to follow ratings. Implementation of the staff information system is seen as a large step on the path to make the Czech army more compatible with armed forces of NATO countries, but finding its supplier has been a struggle. Unisys won an original four billion crown supply tender which was abolished last year after Czech competition authorities found irregularities in the process. The original tender was cancelled by the Defence Ministry, but the former Ministry for Economic Competition intervened and cancelled that decision before ordering a new tender itself. Unisys and IDOM, a unit of Deloitte and Touche, were ousted from the new tender earlier this year for application violations, but were later allowed to re-enter the competition. Unisys denied the mistakes, as revealed by the ministry, ever happened. In announcing the winner, Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny said that technical quality of EDS-Digital and Unisys bids was almost identical, but EDS was chosen because its offer was 109 million crowns cheaper. After the Vyborny's announcement, Unisys immediately said it would and to go to the Economic Competition Office if necessary. On Monday Unisys officials added they could not rule out a request for police to investigate the tender proceedings. ""Our lawyers are investigating this possibility... but it is priority number two, a step after other possibilities fail,"" said Jiri Nykodym, of Unisys's Czech unit. Unisys said Vyborny was wrong to take the decision since under tender rules, price should have been a decisive factor only if two bidders received identical scores from the commission. ""By decision... the tender rules were broken, and, in fact, the way of evaluation of bids was changed in the course of the tender at the moment when it became clear that... Unisys would have won the tender for the second time,"" Nykodym said. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"Apple Computer Inc. said Tuesday it will consolidate its independent marketing and development units into fewer groups to cut costs and to concentrate on selling computers in key markets. Apple also said Steve Wozniak, the electronics whiz who invented the company's first computer 20 years ago, will rejoin with Steven Jobs, the other Apple co-founder, as a part-time advisor to Chairman Gilbert Amelio. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said it is still examining all aspects of its business and will determine by the end of the month how many jobs it will cut. The company also is considering dropping some product lines -- possibly including the Newton handheld computer, analysts have said -- to reduce its expenses by 20 percent by the end of the year. ""Simplicity is what makes this reorganization appropriate for Apple"" compared with other reorganizations in the past, said Guerrino De Luca, the new head of Apple's global marketing efforts. Analysts had expected Apple to give specific details on Tuesday about job cuts and the financial impact of the move. They will have to wait until the end of the month, Apple executives said, while they analyse the company's situation. Since Amelio took helm of the company last year, the company has focused on stanching quarterly losses, reducing inventories and increasing cash reserves, said George Scalise, head of Apple's operations. ""This organisation builds on that,"" Scalise said. ""It now allows us to focus on markets, to be focused on the hardware and software and to take advantage of the strengths we've built over the past six to eight months."" With the most recent restructuring, the second in a year, Apple for the first time consolidates all its marketing functions under one manager, De Luca. The company also set up a worldwide sales and support organisation to be led by Marco Landi, currently Apple's chief operating officer. Wozniak, who co-founded the company with Steve Jobs at the home of Jobs' parents, also will return to the company to advise Amelio on a part-time basis. Jobs rejoined Apple two months ago when Apple bought his software company, Next Software Inc., for $400 million in a move to revamp the Macintosh computer. Analysts have said Amelio has done a decent job of shaping up the company's balance sheet, but have questioned his strategy of attracting new customers by basing the company's next generation of computers on Next's technology. ""Next is 1989 technology,"" said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. Apple will have a hard time convincing outside software companies to develop programmes for the new machines, when they come out late this year, Murphy said. One of the biggest blows to Apple's strategy came Tuesday when Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., said he was ""confused"" about Apple's software strategy. ""I am very interested in continuing to work with Apple as we have done through history,"" Gates said on Tuesday at a new product launch in Germany. ""But I am confused by the Apple operating system strategy ... and have decided not to worry about the future."" Microsoft's support for any new Apple product is crucial because corporate customers increasingly are deploying Microsoft's word processors and spreadsheets as their standard. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"China's corn exports have taken the world market by surprise and could double from current sales levels to more than two million tonnes for the year, Far East grain traders said on Tuesday. ""Just based on done business, it sounds like their programme is big,"" a Singapore-based trader said of China's corn exports. A trader in Seoul said China's corn sales to South Korea alone since the start of 1997 were 690,500 tonnes and could hit 1.5 million tonnes for the year. Other spot sales to Southeast Asia brought the total so far close to 1.5 million tonnes, the Singapore source said, including 600,000-700,000 tonnes of optional sales he said would probably be Chinese product. Japan had yet to buy, traders said, having been badly scorched after China banned corn exports in December 1994 and reneged on some contracted sales. Traders in the South Korean capital said on Tuesday a group of local feed milling companies called the Top Margin Committee bought a total of 126,500 tonnes of Chinese corn late on Monday. Sale prices of $140.95 and $142.90 per tonne inclusive of cost and freight (c&amp;f) indicated a free on board (FOB) price of $130-132 per tonne, with freight between northern China and South Korea about $10 a tonne. This indicated a slight discount, of $2 to $3 a tonne, from the original Chinese asking price of $135 a tonne, a trader whose company represents Beijing's food trading arm COFCO, said. A trader with a major South Korean feed mill company said one of its suppliers could come up with another 750,000 tonnes of Chinese corn. That some of the South Korean purchases have been for August and September delivery indicated China was in the middle of a major corn export programme that could total two million or more tonnes for the year, traders throughout the region said. Trade and industry sources have long said that corn stored in the northern port of Dalian, where it is priced and loaded for export, tops two million tonnes. China's 1996 corn harvest was a record 118 million tonnes, official figures show. In the same year, China imported 440,000 tonnes of corn, down 91.4 percent on 1995, while it exported 160,000 tonnes, up 40.9 percent. While traders in the Far East said they were taken by surprise at the volumes of corn moving out of China, the impact on world corn prices was limited because some level of activity had been anticipated since last November. Traders began 1997 with figures of 300,000 tonnes of total Chinese corn exports. As exports began to soar, traders and other experts started favouring levels closer to a million tonnes. As one source said on Tuesday: ""We're revising our numbers every day. Last week we said a million. This week it's two."" Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) closed 1-1/2 to six cents per bushel higher in Monday trade, with the March contract hitting a 5-1/2-month high, up six at $3.12. An industry executive in Singapore said the Chinese sales had already been factored into the CBOT price, while prices in Tokyo and Chicago were driven by less fundamental and more speculative activity. -- Shanghai newsoom (86-21) 6279-8544 ","LynneO'Donnell"
"LCI International Inc said on Friday it expected to post a 75 to 80 percent increase in operating earnings in 1996 and a 65 percent increase in revenue. Brian Thompson, chief executive of the long-distance company, said he never told analysts to expect lower growth from the company. He said he was standing by his long-term forecast of 30 to 40 percent annual revenue growth. ""I told them I never changed that (forecast),"" Thompson told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said he expected the company to put in a strong performance in 1997, too.   LCI's stock plunged in December after conversations with analysts were interpreted as indicating slower revenue growth. Thompson said he was unable initially to correct the impression because the company was in a quiet period. ""I didn't say we were going to drop in the future. As it turns out, the company will do very well this year (just finished),"" he said. ""I think we will end up around 65 percent (in revenues) for the year.

"America Online Inc., which is under siege by an onslaught of consumer complaints and scrutiny by 20 state attorneys general, is facing a major dilemma as it continues its negotiations with the states. On Friday, New York threatened to sue the world's largest online service for allegedly deceptive business practices and false advertising if its negotiations with America Online seeking relief for consumers break down. Other states could follow and at least one, Washington, said it is considering its options. The Dulles, Va.-based online service has been besieged with complaints by subscribers who began encountering repeated busy signals when they tried to log on after the company switched to a pricing plan offering unlimited access for $9.95 a month. New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco said his priority is getting refunds or free time for frustrated consumers, something America Online Chairman Steve Case said he is not willing to do. New York said America Online, or AOL, had five business days to respond and show why such a legal proceeding against it should not be instituted. New York's announcement came one day after prosecutors from 20 states met in Chicago with AOL, in person or via conference call, to discuss consumers' complaints. While AOL is talking to the attorneys general to try and show it is doing all it can to help solve the congestion problem on its service, it is also trying to appease Wall Street and keep its stock propped up. AOL stock fell 50 cents to $36.75 Friday, not much by technology standards. So far, Wall Street is not worried because most analysts do not think that AOL will have to cough up any refunds, or if it does, they will not be ""onerous,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Cod. analyst. ""The attorneys general have looked at AOL on a number of issues in the last couple of years and the settlements have not been onerous from a financial standpoint,"" Kiggen said. ""By the time the legal machine grinds here, the overcapacity will not be an issue anymore."" But still, amid the storm of bad publicity and busy signals, AOL is losing the new subscribers it has been spending millions of dollars to gain. It said it was cutting back on its television advertising campaign and mailings of floppy disks to curtail interest in its service while it upgrades its network with more modems, spending $350 million. Already, both Prodigy Services Co. and AT&amp;T Corp.'s WorldNet Internet service have said they gained new subscribers this month, at a faster pace than normal. Both attribute the upsurge in their memberships to frustrated AOL subscribers. ""I would not be surprised if they are seeing a lift,"" said Kate Delhagen, an analyst with the Forrester Research firm. ""This is a land-grab opportunity they did not expect."" Delhagen predicted that many AOL users may go into an inactive mode for a few weeks and see if the service improves with the new modems. The next quarterly announcement of AOL's subscriber data will be a closely watched number on Wall Street. Many analysts predict that other pricing changes will occur in the not-too-distant future. Some analysts said pricing can only go down because more and more of AOL's future revenues will come from advertising and transactions, even though the ""all-you-can-eat"" subscription model is not expected to be profitable. ""You have a very large subscriber base, but they are not going to throw off much in earnings, there are no economies of scale,"" said Steve Harmon, a senior investment analyst for iWorld, an Internet news Web site. ""In the future ... they want AT&amp;T and other access providers to direct people to AOL. It will be a destination instead of a network. This is the rough period in between."" So, as AOL continues to talk to the attorneys general, analysts also predict it could come up with some other agreements with other network providers, to further improve direct access to its service. AOL already has a cheaper version of AOL, for $9.95 a month unlimited access, if you ""bring your own access"" to get to AOL, from any Internet access provider. But analysts said AOL could also share some space on these vast networks, which are underutilized compared with AOL's, to host parts of its proprietary content. ""They have to put a network in faster than they can build it and any way they can affordably do it, and that is a big question, (how they will do it),"" said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications Inc. In the past few days, analysts said it has been easier to get online and they have not been getting busy signals as much as before, already a sign that either the bad publicity is scaring away users or the new modems are helping users sign on faster. In the past two weeks, AOL suffered a partial outage of almost four hours of its entire service and another one when users could not access e-mail, for a total of almost three hours.

"British hotels and betting group Ladbroke Group Plc announced on Tuesday the closure of its property arm and sale of its remaining properties to allow it to concentrate on core areas. ""The closure of the property division will allow us to focus upon our core businesses of hotels and betting and gaming,"" said Brian Wallace, Ladbroke's group finance director. Ladbroke said the cost of the closure would be 52.3 million pounds ($84.4 million) and would mainly cover losses arising on the sale of property and a provision ""to write down the remaining portfolio to net realisable value upon an accelerated sale"". The firm said its 1996 accounts, due to be released on Thursday, would also include a non-operating exceptional charge of 17.6 million pounds ""mainly representing losses on disposals of investment properties previously announced during 1996"". Analysts said that although the cost was larger than expected, the closure and property sales removed one element of uncertainty for the group during 1997. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson's Greg Freehely said in a research note that Ladbroke's 1996 results would now include exceptional items totalling more than 100 million pounds, including property disposals and closure of the division. The investment bank said other exceptional items were the settlement of a rent dispute at the Paris Hilton and a settlement to cover an adjustment on the price of DIY retailer Texas Homecare which Ladbroke sold to J. Sainsbury Plc two years ago. Ladbroke is expected to report a profit rise of around 30 percent for 1996, with analysts forecasting pre-tax, pre-exceptional profits in the 155-165 million pound range, against 121.3 million pounds a year ago. Net dividend is forecast at between 6.0 and 6.2 pence per share, compared with 6.0 pence. Freehely said the discount on the sale of properties to Britain's Minerva Plc for 25 million pounds was larger than anticipated. But he adde that ""the decision to provide for the closure of the division and take further write downs is the correct one..."". The portfolio of around 10 commercial and residential properties sold to Minerva had a book value of about 34.6 million pounds and were mostly in London and southern England. Ladbroke said its property arm had also sold a stake in a Boston office building to HN Gorin Inc for $23.0 million in cash, about equal to book value. It also expects to make a further U.S. property disposal this week for about $13 million and use the proceeds from the sales to pay down debt. Ladbroke said the net book value of commercial property at January 1, 1996 was 373.4 million pounds. A property analyst at one British firm said it was no great surprise that Ladbroke had finally withdrawn from the property market as it had not performed in this sector for some time.

"Air Canada's president and chief executive officer, Lamar Durrett, has expressed his frustration at being repeatedly denied permission by the Canadian government to begin daily flights from Vancouver and Toronto to Hong Kong. Air Canada said it finally began its Hong Kong to Vancouver link last December but was currently limited to four flights per week. It also wanted to compete with Cathay Pacific Airways Limite from Canada's biggest hub in Toronto. Cathay currently dominates the Hong Kong-Canada non-stop route with 21 flights per week to Vancouver, Toronto and on to New York. National rival Canadian Airlines International has nine non-stop flights a week to its Vancouver hub from Hong Kong. Speaking to reporters after a speech to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, Durrett said the Canadian government had repeatedly refused to reconsider the bilateral agreement and allow daily services to Hong Kong from both Vancouver and Toronto by Air Canada. He agreed the airline was hamstrung and making no headway in breaking the impasse despite a continuing lobbying campaign. ""I can assure you the minister of transport, the cabinet and the prime minister are aware of Air Canada's desires and ambitions,"" Durrett said. When asked when a breakthrough might be expected, Durrett said: ""We will continue our lobbying effort but it is very difficult to say. The only indication we have had from Ottawa is that we would probably get the increase when the new airport opens (at Chek Lap Kok due in April 1998),"" he added. Air Canada currently uses Boeing 747 Combi aircraft on the Hong Kong route but Durrett ruled out increasing passenger capacity by using a Boeing 747-400, saying a daily service was the solution. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"The heads of 10 leading U.S. high-technology companies descended on Washington Wednesday to lobby for stronger laws protecting their products from piracy. Executives including Microsoft Corp Chairman Bill Gates and Intel Corp Chairman Andrew Grove met with senators in the morning, reporters in the afternoon, and Vice President Al Gore and Commerce Secretary William Daley later in the day. They came armed with fresh research indicating that the software industry has been a key factor boosting economic growth.   ""The PC software industry is a very fast growing, very innovative business,"" Gates told reporters. ""Government statisics don't accurately capture all the things going on."" According to research done for the Business Software Alliance, the industry totaled $102.8 billion in 1996, directly employing 619,000 people and paying wages of $36.4 billion. Another 1.4 million American workers owed their jobs indirectly to the industry. The industry has grown at a rate of 12.5 percent annually since 19890, more than twice as fast as the U.S. economy, the study concluded. To spur further gains, the software executives urged political leaders to strengthen international laws protecting intellectual property, Piracy cost the industry $11.2 billion in 1996, the report noted. Although a considerable proportion of the piracy occurred in China, the software executives said they favored extending most favored nation status to China. Government could also promote software sales by relaxing strict export limits on computer encoding technology, the executives said. Encryption software, which scrambles information and renders it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" was the realm of spies and generals. But the technology has become an increasingly critical security component of electronic commerce and global communications networks. While U.S. companies cannot export powerful encryption products, foreign companies are cleaning up, the executives warned. Last month, for example, Sun Microsystems said it would market an encryption program made in Russia with some of its products to evade the export limits. ""The cat's already out of the bag,"" Novell Inc Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said. U.S. law should be modified to allow export of any encryption product already available abroad, he said. Intel's Grove said fast moving technology companies sometimes get frustrated working with more sedate pace of government. ""We have been asked to exercise patience,"" Grove said.

"Shares in one of Britain's best-performing biotechnology stocks plunged on Friday after it announced that some trials linked to its main product could have been mishandled. Scottish-based Shield Diagnostics Group Plc said parts of a U.S. clinical trial which it hopes will help prove that it has a blockbuster heart attack predictor on its hands had been mishandled and could produce ""misleading conclusions."" Shares in Shield dropped 140 pence to 665 pence on the news. The stock had hit an all time high of 928 pence just ahead of the announcement, a gain of more than 560 percent since the start of the year. The company is developing a diagnostic test for a blood-clotting agent, known as Activated Factor Twelve (AFT), which it hopes will be a much more accurate predictor of the likelihood of coronary heart disease and heart attacks than cholesterol levels. Some analysts believe that the test is a potential blockbuster, which could easily overtake the $500 million a year spent on cholesterol tests. Shield has been waiting for publication of a number of long-running surveys which are tracking the incidence of heart attacks and trying to establish links with different factors in the blood, including AFT. A doctor involved in one major trial, the U.S. ARIC study, which has taken regular blood samples from 16,000 people over more than ten years, wrote to Shield on Thursday to say mishandling and storage of early blood samples could distort analysis of the results. In an interview with Reuters, Shield's technical director Peter Foster said the company still expected to have test kits on the market this year. ""We don't see it as a problem at all and we will continue with our timetable for the commercialisation of the test,"" Foster said. He said data from a British study of 3,000 individuals by researchers based at St Bartholomew's hospital in London ""is there and getting stronger."" Initial results from the St Bartholomew study published on February 21 added to ""the body of consistent positive data from a number of clinical sites"" which back the link between AFT and heart disease, Shield said. At least one analyst however criticised the company for allowing its share price to race ahead when ""they don't even know if the product correlates to a use that a regulatory authority would approve."" Thomas Geimer, biotechnology analyst at Henry Cooke Lumsden, added that ""the product may be valid and be fine,"" but he said the problems with the U.S. trial showed the need for investors to be ""very selective in this market.""

"The ""Great Leap East"" in Shanghai real estate has begun with the property market in the Pudong zone beginning to look up thanks to official pressure on foreign banks to move over there, property analysts said. But the overall outlook for Shanghai's office property market remains grim from the developer's point of view -- vacancy rates are around 30 percent and likely to rise to 60 percent by the end of 1997 due to a forest of new buildings, the analysts said. Pudong's Lujiazui district has been designated by the Chinese authorities as the future ""Wall Street of Asia"". But the office space glut and transport difficulties have kept people away, until now. ""The great leap east is in progress,"" said Sam Crispin, senior manager with real estate firm First Pacific Davies in Shanghai. ""There's been a rapid shift in interest with the banks moving over there. The service sector will then follow,"" he said. Leading the leap to Pudong are the foreign banks which have been bluntly told by the Shanghai city government that they will not be able to do local currency business unless they put their headquarters in Pudong. Eight foreign banks have been given approval to do local yuan business in the past month, and they are busy setting up their Pudong operations, while other foreign banks with full branches in Shanghai are lobbying hard to gain the same privilege. Crispin said Lujiazui's office vacancy rate was probably around 75 percent at present, and would probably remain at that figure for the rest of the year. ""I don't see any significant decline by the end of this year because there's significant amounts of stock coming onto the market,"" he said. James Hawkey, research manager for Jones Lang Wootton in Shanghai, said that while vacancy rates in Pudong were high, the take-up rate was accelerating. ""The vacancy rate (in Pudong) is currently 69.7 percent, but that's to be expected for a newly-developed area,"" he said. ""There's a lot of new supply in 1997, but vacancy rates will probably start to move down,"" he said. With supply far in excess of demand for the foreseeable future, the analysts said they saw Shanghai real estate prices overall sliding further. The foreign banks are paying $20-24 per square metre per month for prime Pudong office space, compared to rates double that or more on the other side of the river in central Shanghai, analysts said. ""Rates (in central Shanghai) are likely to slide over the next couple of years. They may come down to about $30, but what the market is seeing now is that companies that want quality space are willing to pay for it,"" said First Pacific Davies's Crispin. Another real estate broker said he saw the price floor for quality office space in Shanghai at somewhere close to $10-15 per square metre per month. ""The bottom of the pit is the limit, there's too many buildings,"" the broker said. ""But there's still a shortage of really good properties."" ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"Ivory Coast is set for a bumper 1996/97 (October-September) coffee crop because of favourable weather and better farm maintenance but buyers point to quality problems, industry and port sources said on Wednesday. With five months of the 1996/97 season remaining, exporters and crop analysts expect a total crop of up to 300,000 tonnes, against 180,000 tonnes last year and Ivory Coast's official forecast of 230,000 tonnes. Port arrivals by April 17 totalled 228,000 tonnes compared with 150,000 tonnes by the same time last year, suggesting a return to pre-1990s levels. Exporters said markets would be found for the increased supply of poor grades. But one quality inspector said it was unlikely the full 1996/97 crop would be shipped because of wastage and rejection. Precise warehouse stocks were not known but the latest export and arrivals figures suggested stocks of well over 150,000 tonnes, after allowing for offtake by local roasters. ""There's still more coffee upcountry but it is coming down slowly,"" one upcountry buyer told Reuters. ""Farmers are holding back because buyers have been offering such low prices."" Coffee marketing started slowly after the season opened later than usual in mid-November. A fall in world prices in December, stricter bank lending policies for export financing, and poor quality slowed movement of the crop from farms to ports. Ivory Coast set a farmgate price of 695 CFA ($1.20) a kg for 1995/96 but slashed the rate as world prices dropped in late 1996, leaving the Caistab state marketing board with a large paper loss after domestic price-stabilisation payments to exporters. Quality problems this year have meant buyers offered farmers as little as 300 CFA per kg compared to the Caistab's guideline price of 500 CFA. But one industry buyer paid over 500 CFA for premium quality beans. ""Farmers harvested the coffee in October but no-one started buying until a couple of months ago,"" said one crop analyst. ""Coffee is usually harvested in January (after cocoa) so there was a long storage period and the beans turned black."" The output rise was caused by mild weather in the January-March 1996 flowering period. That was boosted by a peak in the general three-year cycle which sees trees yielding a weak, then moderate and finally strong crop. ""Prices were better in 1995/96 so farmers took more care over pruning trees...and general maintenance,"" one analyst said. ""That is paying off this year as tree yields have gone up."" The manager of one plantation said better maintenance meant some farms were yielding 600 kg a hectare, compared to 450 last year. Arrivals are running far ahead of 1996/97 exports which reached a cumulative total of 45,783 tonnes by end-March, compared to 58,667 tonnes from a smaller crop by the same date in 1995/96. Exporters have built up stores which need sorting and regrading. ""The season will be twice as long as usual,"" one buyer in the productive northwestern district around Man told Reuters in January -- when coffee marketing usually starts. Rains in December hampered drying of beans. Farmers had also harvested a mixture of ripe and unripe cherries and had not separated them before sale, buyers said. Upcountry stores visited by Reuters in mid-April had small stocks of coffee awaiting grading or regrading. Some coffee had been stored loose because of a shortage of jute bags supplied by exporters. Ivory Coast aims to boost exports to the level of 300,000 tonnes per year seen before the early 1990s when a drop in world prices discouraged maintenance of trees by farmers. Buyers and crop analysts said plans to rehabilitate plantations, funded by donors, had yet to have any noticeable effect. ""They may be talking about it, but no farmers I have met have received any payments,"" said one crop analyst. ","MatthewBunce"
"Netscape Communications Corp.'s lead antitrust lawyer has written the Justice Department urging it to take immediate action against Microsoft Corp. for what he characterised as ""far-reaching, anti-competitive behaviour."" The letter demanding ""immediate attention"" was dated Aug. 12 and made available to Reuters Tuesday. It represents a further escalation of a battle of words between the rival companies that began earlier this month as they prepared to issue new versions of Internet browser software. Gary Reback, the outside attorney representing Netscape, also suggested in the letter to Deputy Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein that the issue be turned over to the Federal Trade Commission for further investigation. The eight-page letter accused Microsoft of having made written offers to computer makers, Internet service providers, large corporations and others providing for ""either clandestine side payments, discounts on the Microsoft desktop operating system (Windows) or payments in the form of 'real estate' on the Windows 95 (opening) screen."" Reback says these inducements were made on condition that the parties involved would ""make competitors' browsers far less accessible to users than Microsoft's own browser."" A browser enables computer users to access the Internet's World Wide Web. The letter said Netscape had ""uncovered numerous additional steps that Microsoft has taken for the purpose of eliminating competition in the Internet software markets,"" including predatory pricing and bundling of products. Microsoft spokeswoman Claire Lematta dismissed the letter, saying it ""appears to be full of wild and unsubstantiated statements."" ""It looks to us like a marketing document masquerading as a legal document,"" she said. ""Netscape must be feeling the competitive pressure."" The legal clash comes at a critical point as both Netscape and the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant introduce new versions of their respective browsers, Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape, an early leader in browser technology, holds the lead in market share with an estimated 80 percent or more of the worldwide market. But Microsoft, whose Windows systems are found in about 90 percent of personal computers, has moved quickly to gain an estimated 10 percent of the browser market and says more than 1 million people have downloaded its latest browser ,version. That software, Internet Explorer 3.0, was formally introduced just a week ago. On Monday, Netscape launched the latest version of its browser, Navigator 3.0 Both companies have linked up with content providers to offer free trial subscriptions as a way of promoting their browsers. Analysts have said that Microsoft, which has thrown its marketing and financial clout into Internet products, has leveled the playing field with its latest software. Microsoft and Netscape are also already well along the way to developing the next versions of their browsers. Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer known for spearheading past legal tussles with Microsoft, said the alleged practices went far beyond those which had been addressed in a consent decree reached by Microsoft and the Justice Department just two years ago. ""Microsoft's behaviour is, if anything, more anti-competitive and pernicious than the conduct addressed specifically in the decree,"" Reback wrote in the letter. ","SamuelPerry"
"The Czech National Bank (CNB) said on Wednesday that it was not satisfied with the continued firming of the Czech crown, and cautioned that it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary. ""Intervention (on the market) is our normal instrument, and we can use it whenever we are not satisified (with the crown's exchange rate),"" CNB spokesman Martin Svehla told Reuters. The crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket on Wednesday, as the CNB matched the market, fixing it at 27.947/dollar 16.664/mark, or 5.42 percent over parity with the basket, and just below Tuesday's record fixing at +5.51. ""The other question is whether we are satisfied? You heard (CNB) governor (Josef Tosovsky) saying there is 'no reason' for the crown to be like this,"" Svehla added. ""It signals that the central bank is not fully satisfied with this development."" He declined to elaborate, and said these were just ""general"" comments. The crown's surge has been fuelled by more than 30 billion crowns in recent issues of mostly medium-term Eurobonds. Tosovsky said at the peak of the wave in late January that there was ""no rational"" macroeconomic reason for the crown's rise, and the Eurobond wave. The firming currency is compounding a troublesome trade deficit which grew to a record 160 billion crowns in 1996. Some crown dealers have said the central bank that had been putting out feelers in the market recently, but others said that it did not appear that intervention was imminent. ""I don't expect any direct intervention soon,"" said Citibank dealer Emil Stava. ""I don't think their main goal is to help exporters by a depreciation of the currency."" He said the CNB was still mainly concerned with controlling the money supply and inflation. The market has not bought the CNB's comments, as dealers keep buying crowns. Crown Eurobonds keep coming -- another billion crowns was issued on Wednesday -- taking advantage of interest rate spreads against major currencies and an inverted yield curve. The CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent. Svehla repeated that the CNB had no immediate plans to lower its key interest rates, despite a rapid decline in the money supply in recent months. The CNB's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent, while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June. Meanwhle inflation in January slowed to 7.4 percent, year-on-year, from 8.6 percent in December. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JohnMastrini"
"Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) on Tuesday gave investment grade ratings to three of the four largest Czech banks, but said the high marks were partly due to an implied safety net for the banks provided by the state. In its first quality debt ratings for commercial banks in former communist Europe, S&amp;P gave long-term ratings of BBB-minus to Komercni Banka a.s., Ceska Sporitelna a.s. , and  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s.. It also issued all three banks short-term ratings of A3 for counterparty risk in trade with other banks. The ratings fell short of the Czech Republic's sovereign rating of A, but were similar to the marks issued to the Slovak, Polish, and Greek central banks, and one grade above Hungarian sovereign debt. But in explaining the ratings, S&amp;P said the three banks' size and position in the market made it ""highly likely that the Czech government would provide support"" if needed. Thus, the ratings were higher than they would have been if based solely on each bank's financial situation. S&amp;P did not give a rating for the third largest Czech bank, IPB a.s., which is waiting for a roughly one-third stake to be privatised in a tender later this spring. S&amp;P said Komercni had 25 percent of Czech deposits, 26 percent of the credit market and conducted 10 percent of total trading on the Prague Stock Exchange last year. ""Given the bank's size, its importance to the country's financial system, and position in the market, S&amp;P believes state support would be forthcoming if required in the future, although no formal guarantee exists,"" it said of Komercni, the country's largest commercial bank. It said that Komercni's classified loans totalled 35.4 percent at the end of September and its outlook was stable. Komercni's deputy general director Borivoj Prazak told reporters after the announcement that the bank was ""very glad"" to receive the ratings. ""We held our ground,"" despite slower than expected Czech macroeconomic growth, he said. As with the other two banks, the Czech government has a major stake in Komcerni, 48.7 percent. The government has said it plans to privatise all state-held banks, so getting the ratings based on the tacit state safety net adds more intrigue to the debate over the speed and extent of Czech banking privatisation. S&amp;P noted that Sporitelna, the former Communist savings bank where virtually all deposits were kept, was still ""the most important player in Czech retail banking"" but said it ""remains vulnerable to further problems within the sector"". ""(Sporitelna's) asset quality problems remain a concern with customer loans classified as non-standard amounting to 43.6 billion crowns ($1.58 billion), representing 31.8 percent of gross customer loans at year-end 1995,"" S&amp;P said. It said that CSOB's ratings reflected the bank's strong position in foreign trade financing and its joint ownership by the Czech and Slovak governments. The S&amp;P report said CSOB's non-standard loan level had dropped to 41 percent of gross customer loans by the end of 1995 from 51 percent at the end of the previous year.

"The Halifax Building Society's massive war chest of capital could prove to be problem as well as an opportunity after its 12 billion stg market flotation in June, analysts said on Tuesday. Chief executive Mike Blackburn said he sees regulatory headroom for the society to boost its mortgage market share from a dominant 20 percent to around 25 percent and with a massive tier one capital ratio of 14 percent, he will have no shortage of cash with which to do it. But analysts say this could be a double-edged sword because the market will not give the Halifax the benefit of the doubt for too long and it will have to prove that it can make the capital gear up to get a decent return on equity (ROE). Hugh Pye, banking analyst at BZW estimates that the Halifax will have to get rid of some 3.0 billion stg of capital if it is to see its capital ratios down at a more normal eight percent. ""It's both an opportunity and a problem,"" Pye said. ""If they go for acquisitions, the whole world will see them coming."" The Halifax, along with other major players, is already known to be balking at the price that is being asked for financial sector assets but is still very keen to bolster its long-term savings operation and its core mortgage market. Blackburn said the Halifax would continue to target long-term savings products -- life assurance, pensions and investments -- for expansion because he believed it had strong growth potential. ""With an ageing population and governments unable to look after people as they have historically been able to do in retirement, the requirement on the private individual to provide for the long-term will be accentuated,"" Blackburn said. Analysts say the Halifax will be given the chance to see what it can do but will then have to return some capital unless it can spend it either on buys or on judicious organic growth and to exploit what they see as a seriously under-utilised brand name. The Halifax could buy back shares but that would be difficult when, after the flotation, most of the shares will be owned by individuals. It might also look a bit odd so soon after paying a lot of money to be floated. Additionally, the tax position has changed and, as Barclays recently found out, it can be difficult to get your shareholders to part with their shares. That leaves a massive special dividend to its new ex-member shareholders but before that happens analysts expect to see the liberated Halifax flexing its powerful muscles. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.

"The nation's retailers are expected to post modest sales gains for February, with warm weather during the month having a mixed impact on results, analysts said Tuesday. Analysts said retailers are expected to post a rise of about 4 percent in sales from stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, for February. ""While warm weather, particularly in the Northeast, did boost sales of apparel at many retailers, it depressed sales in some hardline areas,"" analysts at Merrill Lynch said in a research note. Most retailers are scheduled to report their February sales results Thursday morning, though Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. reported Monday that its same-store sales rose 8.2 percent for the month. ""Carsons had a strong reading, which might be a tell-tale sign for some of the smaller retailers,"" said Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. One retailer that has exceeded the industry average in recent months, Sears, Roebuck and Co. , is expected to fall back to the pack, with gains of about 2 percent to 4 percent in sales at stores open at least a year. ""Its sales were depressed by its automotive business, which was hurt by the warm weather and hard lines, which continued their weak performance,"" Merrill Lynch's analysts said in the report. Many retailers will have tough comparisons with their 1996 sales from February through the middle of spring due to warm weather a year ago, analysts said. But one retailer that is expected to exceed the average is J.C. Penney Co. , which some analysts see posting same-store sales gains of about 9 percent. ""The (sales) numbers, I think are going to be led by Penneys in particular, which seems to have a strong reading for February,"" Niemira said. ""Apparel is certainly helping them."" The nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., is seen posting gains of 4-6 percent, analysts said. Electronics superstores should continue to trail the rest of the retail sector, analysts said. Dean Ramos, with Dain Bosworth Inc., estimated that both Best Buy Co. Inc. and Circuit City Stores Inc. would report a 7 percent to 10 percent decline in same-sales for February. ""New consumer electronics products such as Digital Video Disk are not yet a factor,"" Ramos said in a report previewing last month's retail sales. ","BradDorfman"
"Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc spelled out a more conciliatory approach to a string of U.S. tobacco-related lawsuits on Wednesday, saying it was now time to explore settling the claims. ""The on-going cost in legal terms, and the impact on the share price is such that we think it sensible and appropriate to evaluate a settlement,"" B.A.T chief executive Martin Broughton said. He put the legal costs at $100 million in 1996, which he expected to rise at least over the next two years. A sensible settlement would be one that covered all current and future claims and was approved by Congress and the White House, he said. There have been press reports that a congressionally sanctioned settlement might be in the works under which tobacco companies would settle claims with U.S. states which have filed suits, in response for immunity. A commentary published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday, however, argued that the states were better off seeking compensation from the companies rather than letting Congress broker a deal. B.A.T has spent an estimated 250 million pounds ($402.9 million) in legal costs fighting tobacco-related law suits. Since the first case was filed in 1954, about 500 cases have been filed although only 19 have reached trial across the industry. There was a big increase in cases filed in 1996, although there are only isolated cases outside the U.S. ""I can't see the legal costs coming down, the trend is for it to continue upwards,"" Broughton said. Last week, a federal judge in the United States dismissed a lawsuit filed by the City and County of San Francisco and 10 other California counties against the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry hailed the ruling as a victory in its fight against lawsuits seeking to force cigarette companies to repay states and municipalities for health care costs of smokers. It is believed to be the first ruling to totally dismiss a lawsuit of this type. Although anti-smoking lawyers said the ruling was a drawback, they remained optimistic about the more than 20 other cases pending around the country. So far the company has not been approached by plaintiffs or the U.S. government with any sensible proposals, said Broughton. ""There ought to be a sensible figure which gets it sorted out,"" said Broughton. Sums of $10 billion and $6 billion -- which represent the profits of the entire U.S. tobacco industry -- have been suggested by plaintiffs as the cost of settlement for the industry. These sorts of figures are clearly unacceptable, said Broughton, especially in view of the fact that the company is confident it will win the pending cases. Of the 19 cases to reach the courts the tobacco industry has won all except one which is currently under appeal. In the last few weeks a federal judge in San Francisco dismissed a lawsuit filed by the City and County of San Franciso and 10 other California counties against the tobacco industry. San Francisco and other counties are among a growing number of municipalities and states that have sued the tobacco industry to recoup Medicaid costs. The attorneys general from 22 states have filed such suits. The first of the trials, which stems from a case bought by Mississipi is scheduled for June. On February 18 a West Virginia county circuit judge dismissed all of the state's claims for fraud, negligence, unjust enrichment and conspircay against 17 tobacco companies, saying the attorney general lacked authority to pursue the claim. A case against R.J. Reynolds, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, is due to be heard in April. A judgement on whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has the right to regulate cigarette sales and marketing is expected in the next six weeks. If the FDA wins its rules would ban free samples and billboard ads near schools and playgrounds, limit vending machine sales, ban sponsorship of sports events and the use of cigarette brands on hats, t-shirts and other products. The rules would also restrict advertising in some publications and require retailers to see photo identifications for cigarette buyers under the age of 27. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437 ($ = 0.620 British Pounds) ","TimFarrand"
"Australian Treasurer Peter Costello's construction of a road-block in front of National Australia Bank Ltd's takeover plans has paradoxically made the bank look more attractive, analysts said on Wednesday. But they said Costello's announcement that he would not allow a big bank merger until parts of the sector became more competitive tarnished the takeover premium built into Westpac Banking Corp's share price in particular.   Investors who had expected National Australia Bank (NAB) to be given the green light to go on the big bank merger warpath pushed NAB's share price 2.5 percent higher, happy for now it will not have to make a big share issue to finance a takeover. ""The price movement in NAB is a reflection in the short term that the market sees it as a positive NAB won't be an acquirer because of the potential dilution of a share issue to fund such a takeover,"" said one senior Sydney bank analyst. ""NAB was underpriced and to the extent that a big rights isuse was hanging over the market, it makes sense for it to kick up a bit,"" said Macquarie Equities analyst Graham Maloney.   NAB closed up 39 cents at A$16.11 after Treasurer Costello ended the ""Six Pillars"" policy banning mergers between the four major banks and two major life groups, but said the four majors would have to wait for stronger competition before merging. Westpac Banking Corp, seen as the most vulnerable to takeover, closed down 20 cents at A$6.67, while ANZ Banking Group Ltd closed down 11 cents at A$7.89. ""There was a margin of acquisition premium there, particularly in Westpac. Now that it appears that there's unlikely to be an acquisition, it makes sense to mark it back,"" Maloney said.   Analysts said however that Costello's comments about ending the current blanket ban on foreign takeovers of the major banks could offset some of the sector's disappointment. ""The equity markets are a little bit disappointed that the 'four pillars' effectively remain, but at the end of the day there is a potential for foreign takeover,"" said J.B. Were, head or research at Craig Drummond, adding that Westpac and ANZ were not expensive banks by global standards. ""The only risk is that there are major foreign holders that bought into both of those banks in the expectation that there could be a major bank merger,"" Drummond said.   ""Some traders could still cause Westpac and ANZ to be weak in the short term."" Brokers said NAB's share price appeared also to benefit from the potential for a takeover bid by a foreign group. ""(The Wallis report) hasn't ruled out the possibility of allowing a foreign bank to take over any of our banks -- it seems to strengthen NAB's position and also the Commonwealth's (Bank of Australia ) position,"" said Kevin Lourey, a dealer at Melbourne broker, Peake Lands Kirwan. CBA's shares rose 28 cents to A$12.98.   Longer term, analysts said the Wallis Inquiry's recommendations on freeing up access to the banking sector and allowing non-banks access to the payments system would sharpen competition and eventually put profit margins under pressure. ""Opening access to the payments system, I see that as critical,"" said Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson. ""The capacity of someone like a GE Capital to have access to the payments system is a fairly important increase in competition,"" he said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","BernardHickey"
"Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged lawmakers on Thursday to put off consideration of controversial proposals that would allow banks to merge with commercial companies, such as carmakers. Instead, he said Congress should press ahead with more modest financial reforms that would knock down the 60-year-old legal barriers that prevent banks from affiliating with insurance companies and securities firms. ""Congress should widen the permissible range of affiliations for banking organizations in order to expand the choices for consumers and increase the efficiency of financial markets,"" Greenspan told the House Banking Committee. Technology and free-market competition are blurring the boundries between financial and non-financial companies, but Congress can afford to wait, Greenspan said. ""Any wider authorization of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernization,"" he said. ""Were we to move forward, it is truly irreversible."" Greenspan's position reflected an evolution of the Fed's view since February when he last testified on reforming the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. At that time, Greenspan urged caution, but backed a transitional approach allowing limited mixing. Since then, numerous lawmakers, small bankers and a host of interest groups, including consumer and labor organizations, have voiced opposition to allowing such combinations. They complained that allowing a company like Microsoft Corp. or General Motors Corp. to own a major bank would diminish competition and could bias lending decisions. Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach, an ardent opponent of mixing banking and commerce, said there was no public support for allowing commercial companies to own banks. ""I think that's going too far,"" the Iowa Republican said. Rep. Marge Roukema, who has introduced a bill that would allow banking and commerce combinations, said she was disappointed by Greenspan's testimony. Because savings and loans institutions are allowed to combine with commercial firms under current law, not including banking and commerce in new legislation leaves ""an enormous loophole,"" said Roukema, Republican of New Jersey. Analysts said Roukema's observation was critical to understanding why Congress has been unable to modernize bank law, despite repeated efforts over the past decade. ""It's already out there,"" said Karen Shaw Petrou, president of bank consulting firm ISD/Shaw Inc., referring to the savings and loan authority. ""That's always been the stumbling block and if you take it away, people will get mad and Congress doesn't deal with that very well."" On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the Clinton administration's bank plan, but sidestepped the controversial banking and commerce question. Instead, he offered Congress two alternatives -- one that would allow such combinations and another that would not. ","AaronPressman"
"British supermarket group Safeway said on Friday that sales growth had slowed since early January and inflation was around zero, prompting fears that consumer belt-tightening could hit the sector, analysts said. ""What has spooked the sector is the comment that things have slowed since the start of the new year,"" said one trader as supermarket shares dived after the Safeway comments. Safeway said in a statement that same store sales were up 5.2 percent in the five weeks to January 4 but over the first 16 weeks of the second half of the financial year, growth slowed to a 4.5 percent rise. Deputy chairman David Webster told Reuters that inflation, excluding petrol, was currently running around zero after a modest 0.3 percent rise over the key Christmas period, and the company said lower inflation and slower sales could hit profits. Safeway, seen as the most technologically innovative of the supermarkets with electronic scanners and automated checkouts, said its experience was ""in common with the sector"". The company, which has some 7.8 percent of Britain's grocery market, saw its shares slump 25-1/2 pence by 1052 GMT to 363-1/2 pence, making it the third largest loser on the London exchange. Market leader Tesco, which last month said Christmas sales rose 7.5 percent, fell 16-1/2 pence to 347-1/2. ""What Safeway is saying is that there is a lack of food price inflation and it does not look as if any is on the way,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. ""In the last four weeks the sector and Safeway have come off quite sharply in terms of overall sales performance,"" Webster said. It was hard to judge whether the slowdown in sales would continue but he added that the company was still seeing ""significant deflation in produce, which is 10 percent of sales"". Profit forecasts for Safeway had been shaved by 10 million pounds ($16.40 million) to 430 million pounds, the trader said, compared with pretax profits of 401 million pounds (corrects from 429.4 million pounds) a year ago. The analyst suggested year profit forecasts for Safeway, Tesco and the two other majors J. Sainsbury and ASDA could be marked down 2-5 percent. Shares in Sainsbury, which has its own problems -- last week it admitted its profits would be hit by investment in boosting sales as it promotes its loyalty card, dropped seven pence to 321-1/2 pence while ASDA, keeping silent on trading, fell 5-1/2 pence to 115-1/2 pence. But analysts ruled out a price war among the big four despite the squeeze on profits, as companies are expected to focus on improving margins. ""The last thing you want to do if sales are slowing and inflation is flat is to give away margins,"" the analyst said. Webster said a price war was very unlikely, adding that if any of the majors launched such an initiative, there would be swift reactions from competitors. ""This is not about price, it is about brand quality,"" the analyst said, adding that Safeway's statement was particularly disappointing after its efforts to restructure and refresh its image over the last two or three years. Safeway's warning on sales and prices comes hot on the heels of an upbeat report on retailers from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which said high street sales picked up in January and exceeded expectations. But the CBI added that retailers in its survey expected sales to moderate in February. Britain's overall inflation rate has slowed to a 2.5 percent rise year-on-year in December, according to latest official figures, while food prices were up a restrained 0.8 percent.

"Industrial conglomerate Pacific Dunlop Ltd will announce another heavy fall in annual net profit on Friday, with abnormal losses possibly sinking the bottom line into red ink, stock analysts said on Thursday. PacDun, dogged by litigation over problems with its U.S.-made cardiac implants and by weak economic growth at home and abroad, has already softened the blow by warning investors last May that annual profit would be 35 percent lower.   The warning pared forecasts of pre-abnormal net profit down to an average of A$162 million for the year to June 30, said BZW Investment Management's BARCEPS forecasting service. This compares with a 1994/95 pre-abnormal result of A$251 million and a first-half pre-abnormal result of A$118 million. But the group -- a major international producer of rubber consumer goods, car batteries and tyres, industrial cables and clothing -- is likely to book a large net abnormal loss of up to A$300 million, Macquarie Equities analyst Greg Dring said.   Pacific Dunlop's troubled U.S. medical equipment unit, Telectronics, which accounted for A$60.5 million in abnormal losses in 1994/1995, will again incur big provisions for costs associated with its pacemaker leads, he said.

"Software maker Cognos Inc sees another strong year in fiscal 1998 and a share buyback or acquisition with its $100 million in cash, Chief Executive Ron Zambonini told Reuters. ""We've had a very strong year,"" Zambonini said of fiscal 1997 ended February 28. He added in an interview on Monday that 1998 would also be ""a big year."" Ottawa-based Cognos makes software to analyze business database information via sophisticated spreadsheets. ""We have six new products and versions coming out in the first quarter,"" Zambonini said. Zambonini said that Cognos, whose revenues grew 34 percent to US$51.3 million in the 1997 third quarter ended November 30, was considering how to use its cash hoard of more than US$100 million, he said. Cognos' net earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 1997 rose to US$23.5 million or US$0.51 a share from year earlier US$10.1 million or US$0.23 a share. ""We think when it's accretive, it makes sense to use our cash,"" Zambonini said. ""We're actively looking right now for other products,"" he said. In early February, Cognos said it acquired London-based Right Information Systems Ltd, a business modeling and forecasting software developer, for $8 million in cash and stock. He added that Cognos planned to expand operations in Europe, especially in Germany, Italy and Scandinavia. A buyback of up to five percent of shares was another option, since the stock had taken a beating on Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange since late last year, Zambonini said. Investors sold off after an analyst downgraded Cognos to a hold from a buy, saying the stock reached his target price in early December. Cognos shares were up 0.20 to 32.75 in Toronto on Tuesday, down from a 52-week high of 53.50. Cognos was unchanged at 24-1/8 on Nasdaq, versus a 52-week high of about 39.

"Chrysler Corp. Tuesday announced $380 million in new investments for South America, including assembly plants for pickup trucks and diesel engines in Brazil and the expansion of a Jeep plant now being built in Argentina. Chrysler, which is cautiously trying to rebuild its international presence, said the projects in Brazil were worth about $315 million, and the expansion in Argentina was worth about $65 million. Roughly one third of the total investment, or about $126.6 million, will come from Chrysler's suppliers, who will play a major role in the automaker's low-risk global growth strategy, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said. ""We don't intend to make risky investments just to be a major player in emerging markets,"" added Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president of international operations. ""We're quite content to grow at a steady pace in regions where we see solid opportunities."" Eaton said the investments will boost Chrysler's sales in the Mercosur free-trade zone, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. But the company's limited production capacity will allow it only to grab a small portion of the Mercosur market away from rivals General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, he said. ""We are targeting very specific market segments,"" he said. ""We don't have any interest or desire to offer a vehicle for every possible application."" The new Brazilian plant, which will be Chrysler's third limited-production facility in South America, will assemble the automaker's all-new Dakota compact pickup truck for sale in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the countries in the Mercosur free-trade zone. In Argentina, Chrysler said it will add production of about 6,000 Jeep Cherokees a year at a plant now under construction in the Cordoba province. The plant is already scheduled to build about 14,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees per year starting next April, and Cherokee output will begin in 1998. A site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll off the assembly line starting in mid-1998, Chrysler said. Production, however, will be modest, with 12,000 trucks in the first year and an ultimate capacity of 40,000 units annually. Employment will start at 400 people. The trucks at first will be largely assembled from ""complete knock-down"" kits shipped from the United States, but the automaker intends to meet the Mercosur trade bloc's 60 percent local content requirement after three years. Chrysler has not decided whether to market the Dakota under the Dodge brand name or under one of its other brands. The automaker now uses the only Jeep and Chrysler brand names outside the United States, Canada and Mexico. The $315 million Brazil investment also includes a new diesel engine plant to be built by Detroit Diesel Corp.. The $10 million facility will supply the company's Italian-designed VM Motori four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines for use in the Brazilian Dakota as well as in Jeep models built in Argentina. Chrysler installs about 40,000 of the engines annually into minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold in Europe. Others suppliers supporting the Chrysler by opening plants in Latin America include Dana Corp., Johnson Controls Inc., Lear Corp., Lear Corp. United Technologies Corp. and PPG Industries Inc., Chrysler executives said. Eaton said total annual vehicle sales in the four-country Mercosur region will increase from about 2 million units currently to about 2.5 million by the end of the decade. ""We think this is a major growth area,"" Eaton said. ""It's politically and economically a stable region, we think with particularly rising consumer buying power."" Including a small plant in Venezuela that assembles Cherokees and Neon small cars from kits, the investments announced Tuesday bring to $735 million the total financial commitments Chrysler and its suppliers have made in South America, the company said. Chrysler stock rose 25 cents to close at $28.875 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. ","DavidLawder"
"Pop singer Michael Jackson flew into Prague on Tuesday to launch his first tour in two years as promoters erected a huge statue of the star on a hill over the city where a monument to Soviet chief Josef Stalin once stood. Jackson's three-month ""HIStory"" tour through Europe, Africa and Asia kicks off on Saturday with a concert on Prague's Letna Plain where 130,000 are expected, but he arrived four days early to do some sightseeing in and around the Czech capital. After his jet sat for half an hour on the tarmac of Prague airport's VIP terminal, the flamboyant but reclusive Jackson emerged in a gold lame and red outfit under a white parasol blocking the bright sun. Several hundred fans handpicked by promoters greeted the star, and he hugged several who presented gifts on the tarmac before Jackson's motorcade left. After waving at others lining the 15 km (10 mile) route into the city from a gleaming Rolls Royce, Jackson and his police-escorted phalynx of luxury cars carrying his entourage drove through a screaming hotel welcoming party. Thousands of fans massed at the hotel on the river Vltava (Moldau), climbing over each other for a glimpse of the star on his first tour since he was cleared of child molestation charges by a U.S. court because of lack of evidence. Pavel Klika, in his late-teens from the southern Czech city of Tabor, played a human ""K"" in a seven-member group spelling out J-A-C-K-S-O-N for his arrival. ""I had to come here to see him to really believe he was in the Czech Republic, even though I have a ticket to see him on Saturday -- I just couldn't wait,"" Klika said. The singer's penthouse suite faces the hill where a 10-metre (33 foot) water-filled statue of Jackson takes up the rock pedastal where Communists built a massive monument to Stalin. That statue was blown up after his death in 1953. Despite complaints about the Jackson statue in some quarters, Prague City Hall finally approved its placement until the concert is completed on Saturday. Two huge torches on either side of Jackson's statue were lit recalling the days when Stalin's Cult of Personality kept two Olympic-style flames burning. The Prague stop, Jackson's first visit to the Czech capital in a long series of rock concerts since the fall of Communism here in 1989, has so far avoided the controversy at other planned dates on his tour. In South Korea, civic and religious groups reacted bitterly to a decision to let Jackson play two concerts in Seoul in October, saying it was unbelievable that the government agreed to make Jackson the teenagers' idol. A planned stop in Casablanca was cancelled by Moroccan authorities, without explanation. A concert organiser said the government did not want 100,000 youths all in the same place. ","JohnMastrini"
"Officials from the world's biggest trading partners agreed Friday to push a deal on opening up financial services markets to the top of the agenda in talks to liberalise global trade. The leaders also emphasised the importance of bringing China and Russia into the World Trade Organisation as quickly as possible ""on commercially viable terms."" The financial services talks are ""the most urgent, major priority in terms of negotiations for the world trade community,"" Leon Brittan, European Union Trade Commissioner, told a news conference after two days of talks between the so-called Quad partners -- Canada, Japan, the United States and the European Union. ""I believe that the Quad meeting has given a shot in the arm"" to negotiations on financial services, Brittan said. The Quad members agreed to put forward requests by mid-June and offers no later than July 14 to work towards a financial services deal. They hope to wrap up negotiations in December. ""That should be an example to the rest of the world and a platform on which to build,"" Brittan said. But he and the other leaders pointed out the need for countries in Asia and Latin America to put together improved offers to the World Trade Organisation. Last year the United States pulled out of talks on financial services because of its disappointment in the offers from other countries. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, in a letter last week to a number of his counterparts, said a successful financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice. It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial services providers, he said. The four trading chiefs also called for bringing China and Russia into the World Trade Organisation quickly. The Quad members said they were united in their belief that China, in particular, should be brought into the global trading forum as long as Beijing committed itself to the global trading system and open market access. ""We are not going to push on the accelerator for political reasons, and we are not going to put on the brakes for political reasons,"" Brittan said. Officials said the Quad members would like new members, especially China, to sign on to a recent pact to eliminate tariffs on various information technologies by 2000. The forum provided an opportunity for the four countries to discuss bilateral trade issues with each other. The European Union expressed concern about the implementation of a 1992 agreement with the United States limiting subsidies to aircraft industries. ""We do not accept that proposition at all, at the same time the United States has some concerns about European practices,"" U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters after a morning meeting with Brittan. Barshefsky said U.S. and EU officials would continue discussions on the issue in June, but that the United States would not agree to any emergency consultations. Barshefsky also had a strong word with Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton over Canada's new copyright law which taxes blank cassettes and distributes the royalties to performers. U.S. performers, however, will not receive any money since the United States has not signed an international copyright agreement. ""We think there is a national treatment problem here,"" Barshefsky said, referring to one country's preferential treatment for its citizens. She said the United States would consider taking trade action against Canada over the law. But Eggleton said Canada was well within its rights and obligations with the copyright law.

"Under pressure from angry stockholders to restructure, WMX Technologies Inc. said Wednesday it agreed to sell for $626 million the 19 percent stake it holds in ServiceMaster L.P., a provider of services ranging from lawn chemicals to household maids. However, critics of the nation's largest garbage hauler stepped up their attacks, demanding more top-level resignations a day after Phillip Rooney quit as chief executive. Nell Minow, a principal at Lens Inc., said WMX Chairman and Acting Chief Executive Dean Buntrock, 65, should stay on the job long enough to find a new CEO, and then step down. Moreover, Minow said Lens would like to see WMX Chief Financial Officer John Stanford -- appointed only two weeks ago -- reassigned or otherwise removed from his post. Washington, D.C.-based Lens owns a small stake in WMX and is working closely with another investment group headed by financier George Soros. The Soros group owns 5.2 percent of the company. Oak Brook, Ill.-based WMX is in the midst of a broad restructuring intended to appease dissatisfied stockholders and refocus its business. On Feb. 4, it unveiled plans to divest $1.5 billion in assets, cut 3,000 jobs and buy back 50 million shares of stock. WMX owns or has rights to acquire 29.035 million restricted shares of ServiceMaster, including an option to purchase 1.875 million shares that would be cancelled as part of the transaction announced Wednesday, the companies said. ""Although our investment in ServiceMaster has provided exceptional returns to our shareholders, WMX is returning to a highly focused waste management services company and we believe our investments should be limited to core business activities,"" Buntrock said. ""With this transaction, we are well along the way toward achieving our goal announced two weeks ago of monetizing an additional $1.5 billion of non-core assets,"" he said. The stock sale is expected to be completed on or before April 14, the companies said. WMX's stock fell 62.5 cents to $34.125 while ServiceMaster rose 25 cents to $25.625, both on the New York Stock Exchange. ""The transaction is expected to be immediately additive to ServiceMaster earnings per share and will provide significant, incremental tax benefits to ServiceMaster,"" said ServiceMaster Chief Executive Carlos Cantu. ""It also eliminates market uncertainties regarding the status of the WMX shares,"" he said. Cantu said ServiceMaster intends initially to finance the stock repurchase with bank borrowings. Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co. said Wednesday it may downgrade ServiceMaster's debt, pending further details of the transaction's financing. Buntrock, 65, founded WMX and was chief executive from 1968 until June 1996. At that time, he was replaced as chief executive by Rooney, who resigned Tuesday, just a week after his ouster was demanded by the Soros group. Earlier this month WMX named John Sanford as its new chief financial officer. Formerly WMX treasurer, he replaced James Koenig, who became executive vice president. Minow said Lens is dissatisfied with Sanford. ""The new one I would like to see reassigned, as well, or gone,"" Minow said. ""They need to bring in an outsider."" WMX spokesman William Plunkett, responding to Minow's comments on the CFO, said, ""John Sanford has been in this job very briefly and he is an experienced financial executive. He is well regarded among our investors and is actively engaged in the process of enhancing shareholder value."" He declined further comment. Downers Grove, Ill.-based ServiceMaster's network of service companies includes ServiceMaster Consumer Services and ServiceMaster Management Services, and ServiceMaster Diversified Health Services and International. Its Consumer Services unit owns and franchises TruGreen-ChemLawn, Terminix, ServiceMaster Residential and Commercial Services, Merry Maids, American Home Shield, AmeriSpec and Furniture Medic.

"A stunning dazzle of laser beams and dozens of powerful search lights dancing to music will illuminate Hong Kong's famous harbourfront skyline on the night of July 1, when the territory is once more a part of China. It will be a night at the harbour Hong Kong will never forget, organisers said, and the hour-long extravaganza, which includes a parade of giant lanterns, will end in final big bang with the largest ever display of fireworks. Neon lights, which have come to typify Hong Kong's skyline by night, will be shut off just before the show and turned on during a ""dramatic moment"" in the laser beam display, they said. Dubbed the ""Hong Kong 97 Spectacular"", organisers said they just want the territory of 6.4 million, which Britain will hand back to China at midnight on June 30, to have fun. ""After the politics is over, it's time for everyone to have fun,"" said Adam Bezark, show director and writer, who started planning the show last November. Organised by the privately funded Better Hong Kong Foundation, the HK$100 million (US$13 million) extravaganza is sponsored by corporate giants in the territory. ""It's a gift from Hong Kong to Hong Kong,"" Bezark said. In just 10 days Hong Kong, a British-ruled colony for over 150 years, will return to the Chinese fold. Over 4,000 VIPs including heads of state are due to descend on Hong Kong and, in a land famed for its punctiliousness, last-minute preparations for the historic changeover are proceeding at clockwork efficiency. Fairy lights now adorn bridges and buildings fronting the harbour. At the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Centre, where the midnight handover ceremony will be held, workers are putting the finishing touches to a new wing built for the event. The entire territory has undergone a drastic transformation in the run-up to the handover. Miniature flags of China and the future Hong Kong, depicting the tropical hybrid bauhinia flower, are strung up in residential estates. On a more serious note, police carried out their first extensive search for suspicious objects around areas of the handover ceremony venue on Friday and would keep up vigilance until all the main festivities are over around July 2. ""Around 2,000 police officers will guard the cordoned-off areas, especially during the peak dates between June 28 and July 2"", a police spokeswoman told Reuters. The event has prompted a proliferation of 1997 souvenirs and China entrepreneurs, too, are cashing in on the fever. Wine maker Dynasty has just shipped in hundreds of crates of a new edition, which it boasts is ""The Official 1997 Wine"" and retails now at HK$119 (US$15.4). ""By Special Appointment of the Association for Celebration of Reunification of Hong Kong with China"", its label says. ","TanEeLyn"
"CalEnergy Inc. upped the ante in its hostile pursuit of British power company Northern Electric Plc Friday, raising its offer to 782 million pounds ($1.29 billion) and setting a Dec. 20 deadline. Northern Electric said it rejected the offer, formally being made by Omaha-based CalEnergy's British subsidiary, CE Electric UK Plc, after carefull consideration. CE Electric Chairman David Sokol said earlier he hoped Northern would endorse the bid after it was raised to 782 million pounds ($1.29 billion), or 650 pence ($10.55) a share, from 759 million pounds ($1.23 billion), or 630 pence ($10.23) a share. ""This is an overwhelmingly strong offer,"" Sokol said in an interview. But Northern Electric Chairman David Morris responded with a statement saying, ""CE Electric has failed to recognise Northern Electric's true value in its revised offer. ""It has ignored the new information provided and it is still looking to buy Northern Electric too cheaply. Shareholders should reject this revised offer."" CE Electric has already snapped up nearly 30 percent of its target as Northern's share price has languished amid concerns that the British government would block the bid. Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang is expected to decide by Dec. 16 whether to refer the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for review. Northern Electric's shares closed at 600 pence ($9.87) as the overall London stock market slid by more than 2 percent. ""The latest offer probably still undervalues Northern but I think it will succeed ... I think shareholders will (accept),"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. Northern Electric has claimed that talks between the two companies before CE Electric launched its bid indicated a price of 700 pence ($11.36) a share but CalEnergy has consistently denied this. Sokol said Northern had not produced any new information in its defence documents but added CE Electric had been holding back ""a certain amount of dollars"" in hopes of a recommendation. ""But given that Northern's board has not wanted to talk, we felt it was not fair to withhold the cash from shareholders,"" Sokol said. He said the final deadline had been brought forward to Dec. 20 from early January because it would give certainty to employees and shareholders ahead of the holiday season. Northern, one of only a handful of independent power companies remaining in Britain, has called on the government to let the bid go ahead and made clear its only dispute with CE Electric is on price.

The site does not include the countries' actual data -- that may come later -- but it lists contacts for obtaining the information.

"A state-owned power station and coal mine in Australia sold on Tuesday for A$4.86 billion in the nation's single biggest privatisation. A consortium comprising U.S. utilities CMS Energy Corp and NRG Energy Inc and Australian investors was awarded the prized assets by the Victoria state government. The sale, announced by state premier Jeff Kennett, followed a tight bidding war involving some global heavyweights of the electricity-generating industry, including other U.S. utilities American Electric Power Co Inc and AES Corp.   The sale of the 2,000 megawatt power station and coal mine overshadows last year's sale of half of Commonwealth Bank of Australia as the biggest Australian privatisation. The national government reaped A$4.0 billion for disposing of its 50.4 percent stake in the bank. The sale of Loy Yang A, the most efficient electricity generator in Australia, comes as private generators clamour to enter Australia's emerging national energy market. As a first major step in the development of a free market in electricity, Victoria and its bigger state neighbour, New South Wales, will merge their markets from the end of this month.   ""We believe that there's a great opportunity here,"" CMS Energy vice-president David Weaver told reporters in Melbourne after the sale announcement. CMS, which has 50 percent equity in Loy Yang A, and its partners have paid roughly 14 times the operation's forecast underlying earnings for the year to June 30, 1997. The Loy Yang A estate, which includes Australia's largest coal mine producing 30 million tonnes a year, is seen earning A$335 million before interest, tax and depreciation in 1996/97.   Due to the depreciation and interest costs to be borne by the new owners, the operation is unlikely to pay any tax for the next few years at least, government sources said. NRG Energy Inc has a 25 percent stake in Loy Yang A. Australian institutions led by Macquarie Bank's Infrastructure Trust of Australia Ltd also hold 25 percent. Horizon Energy Investment Ltd, the vehicle for the Australian-held equity, plans to issue some or all of its shares in Loy Yang A to the public next year in a stock exchange float.   As conditions of sale, Horizon cannot be floated within a year of sale while CMS and NRG may not sell down, or out, of Loy Yang A before two years. The sale will be settled on May 13. About 77 percent of the purchase price will be borrowed, with syndicated bank debt of A$2.9 billion, inflation-indexed bonds of A$350 million and subordinated debt of A$300 million. The bank debt is being coordinated by the Australian and New Zealand Investment Bank (ANZIB) and involves 10 other lead-managers: NationsBank, Banc National de Paris (BNP), Sumitomo, WestLB, First Chicago NBD Bank, Indosuez, ABN Amro Bank, Deutsche Bank, National Australia Bank (NAB) and AMP.   ""We expect this acquisition will contribute to CMS Energy's earnings in 1997 and beyond,"" CMS Energy president and chief operating officer Victor J. Fryling said in a statement. The winning consortium bid A$4.75 billion for Loy Yang A, but it also assumed liabilities worth A$109 million, enabling the government to say the sale was worth A$4.86 billion. The sale takes to A$18 billion the amount of money raised by once heavily debt-laiden Victoria government from the sale of electricity assets over the past two years.   The net proceeds of A$4.75 billion to the state government from Loy Yang A will be used to slash Victoria's public-sector debt back to about A$14.5 billion, Kennett said. More electricity assets are set to follow, including the state's transmission grid, PowerNet Victoria, which the Victoria government hopes will raise up to A$2.5 billion. It could be sold as early as this year. -- Melbourne Bureau 613-9286-1421 ","MarkBendeich"
"Heavy April rains in Ivorian cocoa areas have favoured mid-crop (May-Sept) pod growth and flowering for early 1997/98 main crop (Oct-April) harvests, weather and crop analyts said on Thursday. ""At the end of March we were at 109 percent of the 10-year average (Jan-Mar) in all but a few areas,"" said one crop analyst. ""I would say April has been about average but the last 10 days will give the overall picture."" National weather centre forecasters said coastal and inland areas, particularly around Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, had received well above average levels in the first 20 days of April. ""If rains are heavy for the last 10 days of April you can say the (long) rainy season has begun (usually lasting until August)."" Many crop analysts use private data from undisclosed areas but official weather data for the first 20 days of April showed rains at 10 weather stations averaged 78.85 mm. A total of 95 mm fell in the first 10 days of April and 693.5 in the second. One crop analyst put overall 1997 rainfall at just below average. Another said rains had risen to 145 mm against his 10-year average figure of 134 mm for 12 stations. Rains in some areas had been between 35-145 percent above normal. ""March and April have been good and recent rains also seem quite heavy,"" said one. ""April could be close to its average."" March rains averaged 111 mm, against crop analysts' long-term averages ranging from 80-90 mm. February rains of 10 mm (against a usual 50 mm average) had threatened mid crop potential until rain fell later, crop analysts said. Young flowers for 1997/98 main crop harvests where more abundant than at the same time last year but accurate predictions of harvests would not be possible until June onwards, analysts said. Crop analysts' estimates of the 1996/97 midcrop range between 150,000 tonnes and 200,000 tonnes but rains into May will partly determine harvests. Arrivals stood at 970-980,000 tonnes by mid April. ""Mid-crop assessments are particularly difficult. You need to visit four times as many sites for an accurate indication because of the smaller number of pods involved,"" one explained. Mid-crop arrivals, with smaller bean sizes than last year's export grade harvests (up to 105 beans/100 grammes), are expected from early May -- against mid-April last year. One set of official weather data show rainfall averages for the first three months of 1997 were 34.6, 11.3 and 100 mm respectively -- against 14.2, 50.2 and 64.9 in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 season. The long-term averages for the same three months (1987-96) were 13.6, 37.4, 83.2. For April, the average was 130.4. The latest April 1997 data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of April in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days bracketed): Daloa 0.2 (105.8), Gagnoa 0 (142.8), San Pedro 0 (18.3), Tabou 0.4 (1.0) Man 5.4 (98.7), Dimbokro 18.3 (73.2), Yamoussoukro 22.1 (83.8), Abidjan 0 (128.8), Sassandra 0 (10.6), Adiake 33.7 (64.5), Korhogo 15.1 (14.2).

"China's stock exchanges remain the most open and most market-driven financial markets in the country despite recent official pressure to rein them in, analysts said on Tuesday. The foreign exchange, interbank and treasury bill repurchase markets are kept under incredibly tight control by the Beijing authorities, with even tiny movements achieved only with official approval. ""Unlike the stock markets, the funds moving on the money markets are directly linked to China's currency stability and money supply,"" said one interbank market trader. ""The central bank is afraid that any chaos on the markets could result in financial turmoil at either a national or local level,"" he added. China's futures markets, once home to frenzied, casino-like trading, have been ruthlessly brought to heel over the past year with the authorities forcing speculative funds out to the stock markets, analysts said. ""Stocks are the most open of all China's financial markets,"" said a stock analyst with a major Chinese brokerage. ""There was the crackdown in late 1996, but in fact the central government rarely intervenes in the markets."" China's stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen plunged in mid-December after the official People's Daily published an article warning of over-heating. Prices are now about 30 percent below their mid-December levels. Current rules allow for a maximum 10 percent rise or fall in a share price over one trading day, but information flow, while still behind the standards of advanced stock exchanges abroad, is relatively free, analysts said. On the nation's interbank foreign exchange trading market, by contrast, the People's Bank of China intervenes heavily on a daily basis to keep movements in the Chinese yuan against other currencies within very strict guidelines. The central bank has its own trading room on the market, which has access to all transaction details, while dealers from other players on the market can only see trades done by their own bank. Daily volumes are not posted on the market and rate movements of the Chinese yuan against other currencies are strictly limited, traders said. ""We feel very much that we are in an infair position with the central bank knowing everything and us knowing so little,"" said a Chinese foreign exchange trader. ""The tendency therefore is for us not to bother to think or analyse the markets too much. Most of the trading is done in the dark with us just guessing at the central bank's intentions,"" he added. Traders said the same situation existed on the Chinese yuan interbank market, launched just one year ago, and on the nation's state debt repurchase markets.

"Paccar Inc., maker of Kenworth, Peterbilt and Foden heavy-duty trucks, reported fourth-quarter profits well above expectations Tuesday as it benefited from its acquisition of Dutch-based DAF Trucks N.V. Paccar earnings slid to $62.5 million, or $1.61 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $65.1 million, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier. Sales edged up to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion. But the earnings were well above average Wall Street expectations of $1.23 a share, according to First Call, and Paccar stock rose $2.25 to $69.75 in afternoon Nasdaq trading. ""It was quite a nice quarter for them,"" said analyst Paul Latta of brokerage Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. He credited the better-than-expected results to the acquisition of DAF, completed in November for $543.8 million. ""Everybody knew it would be accretive (help earnings) and was wondering how accretive it would be,"" he said. ""It looks like it's falling into the category of very accretive."" The Bellevue, Wash.-based company did not break out European business, but Latta and others said Paccar's truck-making operations performed substantially better than expected in the quarter. ""Last year was a strong year for heavy-duty truck manufacturing -- much better, in fact, than many in the industry anticipated,"" said Paccar Chairman Mark Pigott. ""Paccar increased its market share (of the largest trucks) as more trucking companies specified our products."" For the year, Paccar net income fell to $201 million, or $5.17 per share, from $252.8 million, or $6.50 per share, in 1995. Sales dropped to $4.3 billion from $4.6 billion. Pigott said analysts expected 1997 to be a reasonable year for truck manufacturers despite softer markets in both North America and Europe. Analysts agreed, noting that markets had held up better than expected despite concerns about overcapacity in the U.S. truck fleet. ""I think the one thing that has been surprising to everyone in the industry is that truck demand has not slowed as much as had been forecast,"" said John Rogers of Jensen Securities. He noted that U.S. truck sales volume was down about 15 percent last year, compared with estimates of up to a 25 percent decline. Richard Walles of DRI/McGraw Hill in London estimated total U.S. truck sales would decline less than 10 percent this year while European sales would remain flat. Truck fleet operators are at the tail end of a replacement cycle, but sales remain at historically high levels, ""so we can't complain too much,"" he said. Paccar said operating profits surged 28 percent last year in its financial services sector due to a growing portfolio and significantly lower credit loss provisions in Mexico. ","MartinWolk"
"Opponents of U.S. trade concessions to China are expected to mount the fiercest congressional battle in years to overturn President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's favored trading status. While supporters of the president's decision on Monday to renew China's most favored nation (MFN) status for another year remain confident of victory, social conservatives, organized labor and other opponents are preparing for a fight. The unusual coalition is blasting the move from both sides of the political spectrum, hitting China's policies on human rights, labor rights, religious rights, trade and abortion. Opponents are also gathering strength from worries over the transfer this summer of Hong Kong to China, as well as the brouhaha over charges that Beijing tried to sway U.S. elections through illegal campaign contributions. ""With Hong Kong and campaign finance lurking in the background, it will definitely be a tougher fight,"" a congressional aide, who requested anonymity, said. ""A lot depends on what happens between now and the vote."" House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said this year's decision would be closer than last year's 286-141 vote in the House to back Clinton on MFN. But advocates and even opponents expect the president's policy ultimately to survive. Gingrich, in a toughly worded statement, said he supported MFN status for China, but blasted Clinton for not using his announcement to press China for advances on human rights, democratic freedoms and religious tolerance. Even if lawmakers muster enough votes to reject the president's decision -- which is considered unlikely -- opponents doubt they could round up the two-thirds vote needed to override an expected veto from Clinton. Congress later this summer will vote on whether to overturn Clinton's decision, with the House voting first. ""The opponents have a better chance than they have had in the past several years. But it still may not be enough of a margin to withstand a veto,"" said Thea Lee, international expert at the AFL-CIO, which opposes MFN status for China. But even a defeat for MFN's opponents could amount to a sort of victory if the vote is close enough. Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, said: ""The president's action represents the high-water mark of the pro-MFN forces. As the truth of the human rights violations in China reaches the American public the case for MFN collapses."" A sign Clinton will face tougher sledding emerged a week ago, when an influential House Republican leader urged the president to revoke China's MFN status, citing Beijing's record on human rights, weapon sales and trade. Rep. Bill Paxon of New York, a Gingrich ally who chairs meetings of Republican House leaders, said current U.S. policy had yielded only ""a Chinese regime which thumbs its nose at the United States and places its heel on the neck of freedom."" But not all Republicans oppose MFN status for China, including Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, who has introduced a bill in Congress to make China's MFN status permanent. ""I believe we should move toward ending the annual MFN roller coaster ride altogether,"" Chafee said on Monday. Some Democratic lawmakers are also critical of China. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said the situation had worsened considerably since Clinton ""delinked"" trade from human rights three years ago, citing worsening human rights conditions, a widening U.S. trade gap with China, and China's continued weapon sales to countries like Iran. But supporters of the administration's policy remain confident. ""In the end, the votes will be there for MFN,"" said Calman Cohen of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, representing the heads of big U.S. corporations. The American Farm Bureau Federation welcomed Clinton's decision and said it would allow the farm industry to expand its favorable trade balance with China. ","RogerFillion"
"Apple Computer Inc.'s chief scientist said the company is seeking to generate outside investment in its Newton computer group, especially for its hot eMate product. Apple Chief Scientist Larry Tesler also told Reuters in an interview here late Thursday that Apple is looking to find new homes for at least a dozen technology projects it recently decided to stop funding. The Newton unit was spared the ax in last month's restructuring, despite speculation it would be scrapped. Indeed, although early versions of the highly-touted Newton fell short of the mark four years ago, Tesler said Apple is getting rave reviews for its latest offerings. Demand for its eMate, a version of the Newton in a stylish clamshell case with a keyboard for schoolchildren and priced around $800, was particularly strong, he said. A small group of Apple executives have been charged with exploring alternatives to increase investment in the Newton business while the company is slashing spending elsewhere in a bid to return to profits, he said. Tesler declined to talk about individual companies which Apple may have approached, and said he is not directly involved in the group's day-to-day efforts, but that they had entered the process with ""an open mind."" The group was prepared to consider a broad set of options, he said, although he would not say specifically whether these could include a joint venture or some sort of manufacturing or distribution deal, for example. ""We are pleased by the reception for the eMate and looking at how we can increase our investment in it at the same time as we lower expenses of the company,"" he said. Apple's lead scientist said talk of scaling back or exiting the Newton business, which helped Apple pioneer the handheld computer market despite its bumpy start, was off target at a time when ""it's just hitting its stride."" In mid-March, Apple set out to cut spending by an average of 25 percent across the company while abandoning support for an array of technologies in its research labs. Apple has said it would cut a total of 4,100 jobs and take a $155 million restructuring charge in the second quarter to the end of March. Apple is due to report its second quarter results on April 16. Tesler said Apple was looking for ways to keep its discontinued work alive by licensing it, for example, to third parties ""so these technologies can come to market."" ""They're not ones that fit our business model, but they're ones that we think are good and ought to come to market,"" he said. ""We have one or two dozen technologies that Apple has decided to discontinue and (it is seeking to farm them out) rather than seeing them wither."" Tesler declined to give details on what these further technologies were, other than the outline given last month in the company's restructuring announcement, and he said the method of seeking new sponsors to further develop and market the technologies would differ according to each. Tesler was attending the Sixth International World Wide Web Conference in Santa Clara, where he gave a presentation to a crowded audience on some of the hottest new Internet technology for use on Apple systems. Speculation that Apple might part with its Newton division re-emerged on Thursday after USA Today reported Apple was in talks with Sun Microsystems Inc. over the possibility Sun might buy the Newton unit. The newspaper reported Sun could be a tough bargainer and said no deal was imminent. Neither Tesler, Apple nor a spokesman for Sun Microsystems would comment on the report. Sun said it does not comment on speculation. Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy said last week he would not comment on acquisition rumors, including those about Apple. He said that in general Sun will remain ""opportunistic"" in evaluating any deals that come its way. Earlier this year Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. (ARM), which makes the speedy processors used in the Newton eMate and Apple's recently launched MessagePad 2000, said ARM was working with Sun's Javasoft unit to make an operating system based on Java technology run on the ARM platform.

"In addition to the $9.5 billion in value that General Motors Corp. and its shareholders will see from selling Hughes Aircraft Co., GM said Friday it will gain about $100 million in annual savings from no longer having to write off Hughes' goodwill, or intangible assets. Each quarter, GM writes off about $25 million worth of good will associated with its 1985 purchase of the Hughes defence assets, said GM spokesman Mark Tanner. He said the write-offs will end after the complicated sale to Raytheon Co. closes, an event expected by midyear. ""Project Triple Play,"" as the massive deal was known to GM executives, includes the spin-off and merger of the Hughes defence business with Raytheon, the shift of Hughes' Delco Electronics business into GM's automotive operations, and the infusion of capital into Hughes' remaining telecommunications and space satellite business. Most of the $4.4 billion in cash that GM will receive in the deal will be injected into the telcommunications business, which will continue to use the Hughes Electronics Corp. name. GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh said the biggest single use of that cash will be to complete Hughes Electronics' $3 billion acquisition of satellite services company PanAmSat Corp. GM also will use the cash to fund the growth of its DirecTV satellite broadcasting business and its Hughes Network Systems business. The automaker has no plans to spin off the telecommunications business, which is growing quickly. ""We think it's a very exciting business to be in,"" GM Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said Thursday. ""We think we're early in terms of the potential of the business."" Losh said also said holders of GM's Class H common stock will receive additional shares in the post-merger Raytheon to compensate them for GM's plan to move Delco Electronics out of Hughes and into into its Delphi Automotive Systems subsidiary. Currently, Class H shareholders have a 25 percent interest in Delco's earnings, while GM and its automotive shareholders control the rest. But Losh said Class H shareholders will get more than 25 percent of the new Raytheon shares allocated to all GM stockholders. GM's automotive shareholders will get less than 75 percent. Overall, GM stockholders will control 30 percent of Raytheon after the Hughes merger. GM Class H stock, currently tied to Hughes' Delco, defence and telecommunications business, closed up 37.5 cents Friday at $63 on the New York Stock Exchange. Raytheon closed up 25 cents at $48.75, while GM's automotive stock lost 50 cents to $60.125. ","DavidLawder"
"Knight-Ridder Inc is playing to its traditional strengths with a $1.65 billion acquisition of four newspapers from Walt Disney Co and an announcement it was putting another electronic unit on the block. ""Knight-Ridder tends to like big city newspapers,"" said John Morton, an independent industry analyst.   In recent years Knight-Ridder has sold off a cable-television business for a net gain of almost $150 million and Knight-Ridder Financial, an also-ran in the fiercely competitive real-time news segment, for $275 million. On Friday, the company, which owns newspapers in Miami, Philadelphia and Detroit, added the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the Kansas City Star and two others to its existing stable of 38 newspapers. In 1996, Miami-based Knight-Ridder bought the Contra Costa Times in California and three other newspapers.   Morton estimated Knight-Ridder, which generates 80 percent of revenues from newspapers, had paid 12 to 13 times cash flow for the properties. ""That's the going rate,"" he said. Knight-Ridder said it would issue preferred shares to finance the deal. Morton estimated the newspapers annual cash flows would more or less cover interest costs on the properties. ""But they are buying newspapers that are already running (profit) margins that Knight-Ridder is trying to reach at its own papers,"" Morton said. ""Maybe it puts them in position to enlarge their overall margins.""   Knight-Ridder's top managers have pressed for several years to improve financial performances at its newspapers, a campaign yielding labor concessions at its Miami and Philadelphia properties and contributing to a 19-month strike in Detroit. Once a power in electronic information for professionals, Knight-Ridder said it was going to divest Knight-Ridder Information Inc. It gave no details of when a deal might be secured. ""The information business is very competitive; the newspaper business isn't,"" Morton said. Knight-Ridder still saw opportunity in electronic distribution of news and information but at the local consumer level. Its San Jose Mercury paper has an innovative and popular Internet service. Morton said he expected Wall Street would be put off by the deal when stock trading resumed on Monday. Knight-Ridder shares were not trading after hours on Friday.

"Hong Kong democracy activists will raise the stakes this week in a bid to bring international pressure on Beijing over its plans to curtail political and civil liberties in the territory. Martin Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party who is in the United States to lobby against China's plans, will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madelein Albright on Monday and U.S. President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore sometime in the week. Lee received a warm welcome last week in an address to the U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, in which he pleaded for U.S. support for democracy in the territory after it reverts to Chinese rule. ""How the U.S. and other Democratic countries of the world react to China's many breaches of the joint declaration will make the difference in whether Hong Kong remains the free society it is today or whether the democratic elections, human rights and the rule of law Hong Kong people have heretofore known and cherished will be extinguished,"" Lee told U.S. senators on Thursday. Despite assurances of substantial automony under handover agreements, Beijing has begun moves to change civil liberties laws, including the Bill of Rights, a 1992 election law and a law on creation of political parties. Future chief executive Tung Chee Hwa last week unveiled additional plans to restrict public protests and foreign funding for political organisations from July 1, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control after more than 150 years as a British colony. Beijing considers the most recent proposals essential for compliance with the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-handover constitution. But democracy activists in Hong Kong see them as further signs of an erosion of basic rights and freedoms now enjoyed by the territory's 6.4 million people. ""It is tantamount to taking away the rights...recognised by the constitution, that are recognised by international covenants,"" Democratic Party member Albert Ho said last week. The proposals also have been condemned by the colonial government and last week drew admonition from the Clinton administration, which called them ""disturbing"". Beijing reacted angrily to the comments, accusing Washington of meddling in Chinese affairs. But a poll by a Hong Kong newspaper indicated that dissatisfaction with Tung was growing at home as well. The poll of 803 people residents, released by the Ming Pao newspaper on Sunday, showed Tung's popularity has hit a new low since his office unveiled the plans to amend Hong Kong's civil liberty laws. The newspaper said the rating of Tung's fitness for the post of chief executive had slipped 5 percent to 4.65 points on a scale of zero to 10. Meanwhile, his ""trustworthiness"" rating sank 10 percent to 4.35. It said the survey was done after Tung's office made proposals on two key laws -- the Public Order Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance, to curb protests and foreign funding for political groups in Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to China on July 1. As the sovereignty transition nears, however, nothing is expected to derail Beijing from implementing its plans. ""To Beijing, time is running out for dilly-dallying on procedural and formal matters. It is time for action and decision because there is work to do in the next 80 days,"" the South China Morning Post newspaper said. Meeting across the border in the Chinese city of Shenzhen to avoid threats of legal action by the Democrats, future Hong Kong lawmakers on Saturday agreed on a formula to enact laws that would govern the territory after July 1. Condemned by the Democrats as unconstitutional and illegal, the Chinese-annointed Provisional Legislature is proceeding with readings of about a dozen bills that Tung believes must be passed before July 1. But concern is mounting that the Provisional Legislature, in its haste, will ram through loophole-filled laws that will be easy to undermine. ""Laws full of loopholes and ambiguities -- and a legislative process vulnerable to challenge -- would become a source of more friction and legal dispute,"" the South China Morning Post warned.

"The army began stationing troops in strategic areas of Colombia as union leaders warned that the state workers' strike due to begin at midnight on Monday could unleash a nationwide civic protest. The indefinite work stoppage by about 800,000 state employees looked set to be the largest protest since 1977. The government feared leftist guerrilla movements were planning a wave of attacks to coincide with the strike and said rebels could try to infilitrate demonstrations. Education Minister Jaime Nino cancelled all classes in state-run schools and universities to ""prevent any risk"" to teachers and students as unions continued to make last-minute plans for the nationwide shutdown. State workers called the strike to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike, compared to the government's weighted 13.5 percent wage offer. They were also protesting the whittling away of labour rights and plans for the privatisation of national and regional industries. ""It has been a long time since the unions have really fought against the government and it's difficult to say how long this strike will last. The workers and the government are very far apart on their demands,"" said Gustavo Triana, one of the heads of the main oil workers' union USO, known for its combative, fiercely nationalistic stance. ""I think what we're building up to is a nationwide civic protest, which will involve not only state workers but also the private sector and social groups,"" he added. Government ministers and defence chiefs spent much of Monday morning huddled in an emergency security summit to discuss measures to combat street protests and the possible blockade of major highways. After the morning summit, Defence Minister Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez told reporters: ""We will be stepping up airborne patrols over the major urban areas and along the nation's main highways. Urban intelligence gathering operations will be stepped up to detect terrorist acts. ""Orderly public demonstrations will be permitted but we will take firm measures to stop subversive elements taking part in the strike,"" he added. The strike threatened to severely disrupt air traffic, oil production, at least by the state-run oil company Ecopetrol, and telecommunications, labour leaders said on Monday. All members of the armed forces including police were ordered back to barracks on Sunday. Gonzalez said police and troops would be sent in to boost security at airports and to set up roadside checkpoints across the country, including at the main entry points to the capital. A heavy military presence was also destined for the main oil production centre of Barrancabermeja -- the power centre of the USO, one of the most radical of Colombia's unions. Political analysts said the public sector strike could spark a groundswell of social unrest from groups not directly involved in the action but ruled out any direct parallels with the political chaos in Ecuador, which began with a general strike and ended in the ouster of President Abdala Bucaram. The opposition Conservative Party was backing the protest as was the Communist Party, which had strong ties to both the public and private sector labour movement. The last major national strike in Colombia took place in September 1977. At least 20 workers died in a single day of protest in Bogota. ","KarlPenhaul"
"Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME), which have reached a nine-month high, are not supported by fundamentals and cannot last, a private Chinese base metals consultancy said on Thursday. ""We believe that worldwide copper fundamentals do not support the copper price rises, that any rises in the copper price will be shortlived and that 1997 will see a bearish market for copper,"" the Shanghai Colub Consultant Co said in a report. Analyst Rudolf Wolff, in an evening metal report, said that with little producer selling on Wednesday, it seemed any further buying could easily push the copper price towards its $2,400-$2,450 technical target. LME copper reached a fresh nine-month high of $2,415 a tonne at 1900 GMT on Wednesday, after a kerb level of $2,392 a tonne, up $42 on the day. But the report said although the charts remained bullish, the fundamentals were not. Shanghai Colub Consultant Co's managing director Yen Zheng agreed, saying his company was more interested in market fundamentals than technical analysis. In its internal report, a copy of which was provided to Reuters, Shanghai Colub says an increase in worldwide copper output in 1996 should continue into 1997, quickly turning the market from shortage to oversupply. New technology was constantly lowering production costs, the report said, with the 1996 average worldwide production cost of 67.8 U.S. cents a lb likely to fall to 60.7 cents a lb in 1997. If the copper price hit 110 cents a lb, profit margins would stretch to 81.2 percent and hedging opportunities would widen, the report said. The level of LME copper stocks affected the price more than other stocks, such as those held by producers and end-users, the report said. It cited the effect that the ""irrationally"" low LME stock level of 90,000 tonnes at the end of 1996 had in pushing up prices. Copper prices had a roller-coaster ride in 1996. They plummeted to a 2-1/2-year low of $1,745 a tonne in June, when Japan's Sumitomo Corp revealed massive trading losses, from a high for the year just a month earlier of $2,715 a tonne. But tight global supply and low stocks saw LME copper prices claw their way back, to start 1997 at $2,167 a tonne. With prices now around $2,400 a tonne, the Shanghai Colub report points to the current large stocks of copper held in LME warehouses and concludes that stocks will continue to rise, pushing values down. ""Recently, LME copper stocks have risen to around 222,000 tonnes, and while they will move around this level, the trend for stock increases will not change and will very quickly rise to 270,000 tonnes,"" the report said. ""This is one reason the LME copper price will fall."" LME warehouses now hold 222,050 tonnes of copper, after a slight fall earlier this week of 2,450 tonnes. China's influence on the world market was also significant because the country was a major copper user, the report said. In 1996, China produced 910,000 tonnes of refined copper, importing 300,000 tonnes for total national demand of 940,000 tonnes, the Shanghai Colub report said. China's carryover stocks from 1996 into 1997 were around 250,000 tonnes, it said, going some way to explain the difference between demand and domestic production and import figures. A recent report in the official Market Daily newspaper said China's 1996 exports of uncast and raw copper were up 2.5 percent on 1995, to 133,708 tonnes. The Shanghai Colub report said that while China's copper production in 1997 should be about the same as last year, demand would rise to 1.1 million tonnes, maintaining the balance between demand and available stocks. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-8544 ","LynneO'Donnell"
"General Motors Corp. was expected to seek bids for its Hughes Electronics Corp. defence businesses in the first of several transactions aimed at shedding GM's remaining non-automotive assets, analysts said Thursday. The possible sale of Hughes' defence operations for as much as $8 billion was the latest of several scenarios that have emerged in recent months regarding GM's plans for Hughes, which it bought in 1985 for about $5 billion. ""I think the GM board and Hughes Electronics management are very interested in divesting the defence business, merging the Delco Electronics unit with the Delphi components business, and spinning off the communications business into a separate company,"" said CS First Boston defence analyst Peter Aseritis. ""My sense is that they want to find a merger partner for the defence business first,"" he added. Analysts said several candidates could be interested in Hughes' defence units, including McDonnell Douglas Corp., Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. GM declined to comment on the idea of splitting off the defence business, first reported by the Wall Street Journal. ""I have to classify it all in the realm of speculation, for which we have no comment,"" said GM spokeswoman Toni Simmonetti in New York. However, GM disclosed in recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings that Hughes wants to ""strengthen its leadership position through acquisitions, consolidations, realignments and divestitures,"" among other actions. Hughes' missile systems, radar, electronic warfare, thermal imaging, information systems and other defence units, which earned operating profits of $688 million on revenues of $5.95 billion in 1995, are regarded as attractive plums in a consolidating defence industry. McDonnell Douglas, which many analysts said was ready for an acquisition, declined to confirm any specific bidding activity, but said it was interested in Hughes. McDonnell President Harry Stonecipher ""has gone on record saying that he is interested in making an acquisition. He finds Hughes an interesting choice,"" a McDonnell spokeswoman said. But analysts cautioned that any transaction involving Hughes would be complicated, because of tax considerations for GM and its Class H shareholders. Under a complex ownership structure, shareholders of GM Class H stock are entitled to dividends based on Hughes' earnings while GM owns the subsidiary's assets. Thus an outrightright sale would create a major tax liability for GM. For that reason, analysts said GM was more likely to pursue a non-cash transaction, such as a stock swap or other type of deal that could take some time to structure. ""Clearly I would personally be surprised if there was an outright sale,"" said BT Securities analyst Wolfgang Demisch. A sale of the defence business would clear the way for GM to fold its Delco Electronics unit, which makes audio systems and other components, back into its Delphi Automotive Systems auto parts unit. That would leave Hughes' lucrative telecommunications and space segment, which has been soaring on the growth of its DirecTV satellite broadcasting service. Those operations may be spun off into a separate company, analysts said. ","DavidLawder"
"British drugs group Medeva Plc announced a strong rise in underlying profits on Wednesday and stressed its growing Americanisation with a decision to seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Pre-tax profits before exceptional items rose 31 percent to 103.5 million pounds ($167.4 million) in 1996, and shareholders were rewarded with a 20 percent rise in the dividend to 4.8 pence per share. Medeva's shares, which have enjoyed a solid run this year, rose three pence to 283 pence in morning trading. Headline profits were hit by an expected 65 million pound charge for last year's acquisition of the U.S. assets of defunct British group Fisons from Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc. Products from the business, based in Rochester, New York, helped to fuel a 30 percent rise in Medeva's sales last year to 332 million pounds. However, analysts expressed some concern over slowing growth rates for Medeva's top-selling and most profitable drug Methylphenidate, which is used to control attention deficit disorder in children and young adults. Sales rose 20 percent to 108 million pounds, but this was a marked slowdown from the previous year and Medeva warned that it faced increased competition in the tightly-controlled U.S. market. The Rochester acquisition helped push the proportion of Medeva's operating profits contributed by U.S. operations to 86 percent last year from 79 percent, with sales increasing to 69 percent from 62 percent. In a sign of its growing emphasis on the United States, Medeva announced that all its U.S. businesses would operate under the name Medeva Pharmaceuticals, and said it would switch its American Depositary Receipt (ADR) listing to the prestigious Wall Street New York Stock Exchange from the smaller American Stock Exchange. Finance director Garry Watts told Reuters the decision reflected the strength of their American business and the fact that around 35 percent of Medeva shares were held in the United States. ""I think it is time that we were on the big board,"" he said. Chief executive Bill Bogie said Medeva, which specialises in acquiring existing businesses and products, now had ""a fully integrated sales force"" in the United States. He said the current force totalled 264 part- and full-time staff, but added that ""the structure is there to grow to a thousand if you want to."" The impact of the restructured U.S. operation was already being felt by the Rochester products, Bogie said. Sales of the ten products totalled $77 million in the first six months of Medeva's ownership, compared to $100 million in the whole of 1995. One of the strongest performers was appetite inhibitor Ionamin, used to treat obesity, although Medeva said sales slowed significantly at the end of 1996 following the launch of American Home Products Corp's rival Redux. Nomura analyst Nick Woolf said the mood of an analysts' meeting with Medeva, which has fallen in and out of favour as investors struggled to understand its unique strategy, was ""really quite positive."" ""Especially with the Rochester products, where they have got some quite dynamic ideas in terms of sales and marketing, so that is quite exciting,"" Woolf said. Outside the United States, Bogie said he was still interested in building up Medeva's position in Italy and Germany, but declined to say if he had acquisitions in mind. And he stressed Medeva's growing links with the biotech industry as a potent source of future products to sell via Medeva's expanding infrastructure. ($ = 0.618 British Pounds) ","JonathanBirt"
"Textiles group Coats Viyella Plc, reporting lower first-half results, said on Wednesday it is confident it is on course for a bounce back to profit growth in 1997 as it puts a restructuring behind it. The first 17.2 million pound chunk of reorganisation costs announced in March caused first-half pretax profit to tumble 34 percent to 47 million pounds ($73.09 million), with the remaining 38 million pounds of costs all to be charged against second-half earnings. Chief executive Neville Bain told Reuters that ""charges will be taken this year so 1997 will be put on a clean basis going forward"" and predicted ""a good return to profit"" next year. The announcement from Coats, whose products range from bath towels to precision engineering components, ended uncertainty about how the charges would fall. An upbeat statement about prospects in key markets, in contrast with the gloomier tone of some competitors, helped to boost Coats' shares by 4-1/2 pence to 164 pence by late morning. Bain said he is confident the group will achieve its cumulative annual cost saving targets of 10 million pounds in the second half of 1996, 25 million pounds in 1997 and 35 million in 1998. But he said not all of this will reach the bottom line as the group spends money shifting an increasing amount of clothing production to lower-cost areas such as Morocco, eastern Europe and parts of Asia. The reorganisation involves shedding 7,750 jobs, including nearly 3,000 in Britain. Rival Courtaulds Textiles Plc announced on Tuesday that it is belatedly following Coats' lead in looking abroad to tackle continued margin pressures. Coats' first-half operating profits on continuing operations slipped to 78.0 million pounds from 87.3 million, largely due to declines at its threads division, which produces thread for sewing and knitting and is the world's second-biggest zipper maker. Bain said the decline was ""largely due to Brazil and Turkey in the first-half of 1995 having exceptional levels of profits. We said at the time that was unsustainable."" Coats expects a ""worthwhile"" improvement in second-half results year-on-year before charges, with the key September to December period accounting for half its annual profits. It said trading conditions ""appear to be showing some signs of improvement"", with a return of consumer confidence in Britain and normal weather patterns expected to help the second-half. Bain said there was continued progress at its Jaeger and Viyella fashion retail chains, and the group's home furnishings business is struggling to keep up with demand caused by a ""substantial"" pick-up in the British housing market. ""The USA is picking up and we think it will good to us, especially in threads and engineering,"" Bain added, while demand in the rest of Europe is expected to remain mixed.

"America Online Inc signed a hefty marketing pact with little-known long distance provider Tel-Save Holdings Inc, immediately giving AOL a big chunk of cash and Tel-Save access to eight million AOL users. AOL and Tel-Save signed a deal to offer AOL members lower-cost long distance telephone service through Tel-Save, which AOL will promote and market to its members. AOL will get an upfront payment of $100 milllion in cash from Tel-Save, a telecommunications service provider based in New Hope, Pa. AOL will also get warrants to buy Tel-Save shares.   Analysts and AOL said that the deal was a boost for the company because it showed that AOL was able to put a big value on its growing subscriber base and that it can derive revenues from sources other than subscriber fees. ""This is a proof of promise,"" said Bob Pittman, chief executive of AOL Networks. ""This is not a deal a search engine could do because they don't have the assets. We have put a number on it and we have another $100 million in our coffers."" While AOL has ""plenty of cash"" for its business plan, the Tel-Save deal will provide funds for general corporate purposes, though AOL must pay the $100 million back, he said.   Analysts said that the first $43 million must be paid back over ten quarters, beginning in its fourth quarter. That is when the online company will start marketing the Tel-Save long-distance service to its members, thruogh pop-up screens asking them if they wish to enroll. A sampling will begin this summer. Tel-Save currently offers long-distance and wireless service to about 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses. Tel-Save said its long-distance service featured lower costs than services offered by AT&amp;T Corp, MCI Communications Inc and Sprint Corp. ""These subscribers are the cream of the crop,"" said Dan Borislow, chief executive of Tel-Save. ""This is a great use of our cash."" He declined to estimate how many AOL members may sign up for its long-distance service. AOL's warrants will let the company buy shares of Tel-Save at strike prices ranging from $14.00 to $15.50, for up to 12 million shares, if the total number of AOL members using Tel-Save reaches 3.5 million subscribers. ""They (AOL) could wind up owning over a third of this company,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co analyst. Tel-Sav's shares jumped 7-3/8 to 20-1/2 on Tuesday.   To be sure, some analysts cautioned that AOL will have to compete against long-distance companies that spend billions of dollars on marketing. ""This will be the ultimate test of AOL's marketing prowess,"" said David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments. ""It's AOL against 'the dime lady,'"" he added, referring to Sprint's popular television commercials featuring actress Candice Bergen. ","TheresePoletti"
"Norfolk Southern Corp. Monday launched a new effort to derail a planned $9.1 billion merger between Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp., proposing to buy a stake in Conrail even though its takeover offer has been rejected. The Norfolk, Va.-based railroad said it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail stock for $115 per share if investors defeat a key provision that would allow the proposed Conrail-CSX union to move forward. Norfolk Southern made its offer in a direct appeal to Conrail shareholders, many of whom are unhappy with the proposed Conrail-CSX transaction. Conrail shareholders are scheduled to vote on the provision Friday at a special meeting in Philadelphia. Philadelphia-based Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion cash offer, saying that the $9.1 billion cash and stock transaction with CSX provides more strategic benefits. Conrail is asking shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law that effectively requires CSX, which already owns 19.9 percent of Conrail shares, to pay $110 per share in cash for the rest. If shareholders waive that provision, Richmond, Va.-based CSX will buy another 20 percent of Conrail shares for $110 per share and acquire the rest of Conrail in stock. Norfolk Southern asked shareholders to reject the measure, saying it would amend its existing all-cash offer in order to buy about 8.2 million Conrail shares. The purchase of the shares would represent the maximum number of shares that Norfolk Southern can buy without triggering Conrail's ""poison pill"" anti-takeover defence plan. Once completed, Norfolk Southern would then begin a second offer for all remaining Conrail shares. Norfolk Southern said the 9.9 percent offer would not be subject to termination of the merger agreement between Conrail and CSX and would not require any action by Conrail's board. ""Conrail shareholders have an opportunity to reassert control over their corporation and reject the coercive tactics being used to pressure them into approving CSX's inferior offer,"" Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode said in a statement. Officials from Conrail and CSX could not immediately be reached for comment. Norfolk Southern announced its plan after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It also said a vote to reject the CSX/Conrail measure would signal the beginning of the process to unseat Conrail directors at Conrail's next annual meeting. ","RobinSidel"
"Lloyd's of London on Friday moved to reassure its traditional backers, known as Names, that there was no hidden agenda to force them out of the 300 year-old insurance market. ""Trust us,"" outgoing Chairman Sir David Rowland answered in response to a question from one worried Name. ""It'll be all right."" Speaking at his last annual meeting as chairman, Rowland also promised there would be no move to do away with the practice in which syndicates are reformed each year despite criticisms from some managing agents that it is out-of date and expensive. But he threw his support behind recent changes in the market which have seen members move away from unlimited to limited liability. On retirement, said Rowland, he would become a limited liability member of Lloyd's. ""Unlimited personal liability has been shown to mean exactly what it says, and I no longer believe that the substantial advantages of that method of trading should blind us to the reality of its possible consequences for the individual,"" he said. New trading structures with continuous capital, allowing the commitment of resources for the long-term development of underwriting businesses, may prove the better route, said Rowland. Unless it embraces change, Lloyd's will see a steady decline in its fortunes, he warned. The annual reforming of syndicates and the reinsurance of outstanding claims when the syndicate year closed -- known as reinsurance to close -- had appeared to work admirably until the 8 billion pounds ($13 billion) in losses between 1988 and 1992 that at one point threatened to destroy Lloyd's. Rowland argued it would never again be possible to reinsure to close an annual account without remembering the vulnerabilty of the system. Critics have increasingly questioned the viability of the annual system of raising capital for Lloyd's, which they say is both costly and prevents long-term planning. Only a few days ago, the outspoken former chairman of Lloyd's, Robert Hiscox, described it as an ""anachronistic absurdity"" and attacked the complexity of the current capital structure where Names and corporate capital co-exist. There is increasing tension at Lloyd's between Names, whose assets largely back the market on an unlimited basis and limited liability corporate capital, first introduced in 1994. These tensions will be resolved by market forces, promised Rowland. ","SimonCowell"
"China's central bank, stung by the collapse of a major trust company, is looking warily at the nation's financial system, warning of dangers to Beijing's prestige and social stability. The failure of the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC) because of ""serious illegal and irregular practices"" was deeply embarrassing for China's financial regulators, bankers said. But it was a vindication of sorts for those who have been trying to make the People's Bank of China more like its Western counterparts, boosting the central bank's ability to detect problems in the financial sector, they said. That eventually could help to give it more independence from the nation's political decision-makers, bankers said. Under a three-year, World Bank-sponsored programme, the central bank enlisted the help of big accounting firm Price Waterhouse to strengthen its accounting and supervisory abilities. ""They (central bank officials) recognised they had to improve the quality of the information they had,"" said J. Thomas Macy, who headed up the Price Waterhouse team working with the central bank. ""You can't make good decisions if you don't have good data,"" he told Reuters in an interview. LOANS OFTEN NOT REPAID The People's Bank of China was once seen as merely the financial arm of the government, ensuring that money allocated for lending went to the right place. Whether borrowers ever repaid was less important. China's four, main state-run banks have a combined 134,000 branches and each branch reported to the central bank independently. That gave the central bank a huge flow of uncoordinated and often not very useful information. A Western diplomat who viewed such reports piled up at the central bank said he asked a bank employee several years ago what the central bank did with the data and was told earnestly: ""We add the numbers up."" ""The data gave no idea of the state of health of the financial system,"" said Price Waterhouse's Macy. That is clearly changing. A computer system was designed for the bank's reporting purposes and a risk-based aproach to financial examination is being introduced. Macy said an 800-page examination manual would be given to some 10,000 bank examiners. CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENS GRIP ON SECTOR Chinese bankers say the central bank is already tightening its grip on the financial system. ""They are checking much more closely now,"" said a Chinese banker in Shenzhen near Hong Kong. ""They are keeping a close eye on the commercial banks."" Many foreign bankers agree there has been a marked change. ""The data collected is getting much better,"" said a Japanese banker. ""But more work on technical inspections is needed to bring them (central bank operations) up to international levels,"" he said. Others argue that such skills are not learned overnight. Bankers said problems similar to those that forced the closure of CADTIC this month still lurk elsewhere in the financial sector. Smaller trust companies set up by regional or local governments are particularly vulnerable. CENTRAL BANK SOUNDS ALARM BUT LACKS INDEPENDENCE Central bankers have been sounding the alarm over financial risk, bringing up the theme repeatedly at a recent national banking conference. They pushed home the need for a separation of trust companies -- like CADTIC -- from banks so that banks and their depositors would be insulated from problems at trust firms. They also made their case for keeping bank funds out of the volatile stock and futures markets. If the central bank can demonstrate that it has taken charge of financial supervision it might find it has more room to manoeuvre in the policy-making area, bankers said. Economic issues such as money supply targets -- or even the decision to let foreign banks conduct local currency business -- are highly politicised in China. The central bank ultimately must listen to the views of the State Council, or cabinet. While this may be politically necessary now, bankers said they would like to see the government give the central bank a vote of confidence by granting it more decision-making authority.

"America Online Inc. said on Tuesday it plans to launch a national Internet service in Japan in mid-April, and vowed to make Japan its biggest international market within a couple of years. ""Japan is a huge market opportunity for AOL, and we are pursuing it aggressively,"" AOL Chairman Steve Case said in a statement. ""Over the next few years, we plan to make Japan our largest international market."" AOL Japan Inc. is a three-way joint venture by America Online, Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd., a diversified Japanese trading company; and publisher Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc., or Nikkei. America Online owns a 50 percent stake, Mitsui 40 percent and Nikkei 10 percent. Taking aim at established rivals in Japan, officials with Dulles, Va.-based America Online, the world's No. 1 online service, said the new service would offer a range of graphically oriented, multimedia features not available on the largely text-based services of other Japanese online services. Leading online and Internet service providers include Nifty-serve, a 2 million-member Japanese licensee of Columbus, Ohio-based CompuServe Corp. ; PCVAN, a unit of Fujitsu Ltd. and ASCIINet, a unit of ASCII Corp.. AOL Japan promised to make its service uniquely Japanese, with content, customer service, billing and management all rendered in the Japanese language. AOL Japan will be offered at a monthly fee of 980 Japanese yen, or about $8, for three hours' use, and 480 yen, or $4, for each additional hour, about half the hourly price of Nifty-serve, Japan's dominant online service. New AOL Japan members will get a 10-hour free trial in the first month, the company said. AOL International President Jack Davies said the service will offer a fixed price for access to all information services, in contrast to Nifty-Serve requirements for access to some databases. Another newcomer to Japan's market for online and Internet access is Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft Corp.'s Microsoft Network (MSN), which is allied with national phone company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.. MSN Network claims more than 200,000 members in Japan. Industry analyst Peter Krasilovsky said AOL Japan and MSN were positioned to rapidly acquire market share from incumbent online service providers like Nifty-Serve, whose services have an antiquated look compared to AOL. ""It looks like AOL will be a major player, battling it out with the Microsoft Network,"" said Krasilovsky of Arlen Communications, a consulting group based in Bethesda, Md. Japan's total online audience is estimated at around 5.7 million computer users, America Online said, citing recent statistics from market research firm International Data Corp. AOL Japan will have access to news from Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial newspaper and other well-known Japanese publications. The service will supply sports, news and entertainment to Japanese subscribers and give them direct access to other America Online services around the world, plus member-to-member chat groups, electronic mail and Internet access. Additional partnerships will be announced with major Japanese publishers before the service is launched April 15, America Online officials said. Initially, about two-thirds of Japan's population will be able to dial the service via local numbers, officials said. The company plans to make more comprehensive access available shortly. Like its North American and European cousins, AOL Japan will target home computer users, not businesses. America Online is the world's largest online service with 8 million subscribers. CompuServe is second at 5.3 million members, including the 2 million Nifty-Serve members. America Online also said Tuesday its international subscriber count had surpassed the 600,000 mark and was on track to reach 1 million members by September. America Online has nearly 500,000 members in Europe, and AOL Canada has more than 100,000 members, the company said. ""Our goal is to have 1 million members outside of the U.S. by September 1997. We think we are well on track to acheive that with the growth in Japan and other countries,"" Davies said in a phone interview. ","EricAuchard"
"International Business Machines Corp. is expected to report solid fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, but analysts expect the stronger dollar will hurt the computer giant's profits. The Armonk, N.Y.-based company will report earnings after the stock market closes, the first time it has done so in recent memory. Wall Street analysts are predicting earnings of $3.13 a share to $4.32 per share, with a consensus of $3.88 a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst estimates. A year ago, IBM earned $3.09 a share, or $1.7 billiion, including special charges, in the fourth quarter. ""I think it will be a good quarter,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich. ""I'm not looking for a blowout quarter,"" Milunovich said, adding that the dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter and that IBM could see as much as a 25-cent-per-share negative impact on earnings from currency fluctuations. The earnings report comes amid mixed results from the computer industry for what is traditionally its biggest quarter of the year. Apple Computer Inc. reported a bigger-than-expected loss, but Sun Microsystems Inc. had stronger-than-anticipated second-quarter earnings and Digital Equipment Corp. reported a slightly better-than-expected profit in its second quarter. Analysts also expect IBM to report bigger expenses in the fourth quarter for its restructuring, which it no longer writes off as a charge. In the third quarter, IBM had restructuring costs of about $200 million for employee buyouts. ""They will have an expense for restructuring, and it could be twice as much as the September quarter,"" said Dean Witter analyst Jay Stevens. Analysts said IBM's employees in Europe have been much slower to accept its buyout plans. John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst, predicts IBM will have costs of about $700 million in 1997 for organisational changes in Europe. ""Europe remains a slow grower, which has led to a number of organisational and planned efficiency changes, which we expect will require over $700 million in 1997,"" Jones said in a report. He said these expenses are included in his 1997 earnings estimate of $11.20 a share. For 1996, analysts expect IBM to earn between $10.30 to $11.50 a share, with a consensus of $11.05, according to First Call. Analysts said sales of IBM's midrange computers, the AS/400, should post growth of about 10 percent and that there should be a big improvement in RS/6000 workstations. IBM will host its quarterly analyst meeting and conference call sometime after its earnings are released late Tuesday. Analysts said the company was releasing its earnings after the close to avoid the recent volatility in its stock -- which has climbed or fallen as much as $10 on the days it reports earnings -- during its conference call with analysts. IBM stock was down $1 at $164.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ","TheresePoletti"
"A ministerial conference of Mekong River nations on Friday agreed to push forward cross-border cooperation to build a prosperous future for the once war-torn region. Growing trust among the six nations of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) would allow huge investment in what was being dubbed the ""last frontier of economic development"", said Bong-Suh Lee, Asian Development Bank (ADB) vice president. ""We can expect such investment to grow rapidly and reach a target of at least $1.3 billion by the turn of the century,"" Lee told a news conference after the meeting in China's southwestern Kunming city. Ministers of Burma, Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam agreed at the conference to pursue development of infrastructure projects aimed at knitting together a region long divided by bitter distrust and war. The ministers approved work to map out strategies for the next 25 years of development along the mighty Mekong River. The ADB, which backs the GMS programmes, had prepared $300 million in loans ready for investment in the region over the next three years, Lee told the conference. Far greater sums would be needed to finance crucial projects such as a road connecting Bangkok to Phnom Penh and Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, said Gunther Hecker of the ADB's transport and communication department. ""The $300 million is the trigger element for others to follow,"" Hecker told Reuters. ""We lay the seeds."" Lee said at least $9 billion would be needed to finance transport and telecommunications projects in the region, home to around 230 million people, and added that the private sector was appearing more willing to contribute. ""I have heard from many private investors that probably the GMS is the last frontier of economic development,"" he said. Investor enthusiasm is relatively new to much of the Mekong River region, which was riven for decades by conflicts over ideology and borderlines. China and Vietnam clashed repeatedly in the 1980s after a bloody border conflict in 1979. Vietnamese troops fought Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia through the late 1980s while fighting was far from rare among many of the region's other borders. GMS meetings had been vital in building trust in the region, conference participants said. Priority GMS projects include a Kunming-to-Bangkok highway, a fibre-optic cable telecommunications loop through Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia and action to curb deforestation on the Mekong's upper reaches. Ministers at the conference said the ADB should continue its role as organiser of regional projects but agreed on the need for closer coordination with other potential investors from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other nations. How coordination would be organised was not decided in detail, but observer Finn Nielsen of the World Bank said huge funding requirement in the region meant there was little chance of a turf war breaking out among development investors. ""There are more projects here than the ADB, the World Bank or anyone can handle, so that isn't a problem,"" Nielsen said. ","MureDickie"
"Hewlett-Packard Co. jumped solidly into the Microsoft Windows NT camp on Wednesday, saying it would ""aggressively integrate"" the operating system into its computers and spend tens of millions of dollars on joint strategies. HP Chairman and CEO Lewis Platt, appearing at a news conference with Microsoft Corp Chairman and CEO Bill Gates, said the companies would work together on a broad range of products and services aimed at reducing computing costs.   At one time Hewlett-Packard dismissed Windows NT, designed for the servers that run computer networks. Platt said customer demand was behind the decision to embrace it. ""It's all built around input from our customers,"" he said in a news conference at HP's corporate headquarters in Palo Alto. Support for Windows NT -- only one aspect of the collaboration announced by the companies -- corresponds to HP's plan to develop a new processor with Intel Corp capable of running both NT and Unix software.   HP's warming to Microsoft could cause some discomfort to the company's partners, especially Netscape Communications Corp, Microsoft's Internet arch-rival. HP forged an alliance last May with Netscape to help companies build Internet-based internal networks on Unix and NT systems, analysts said. ""Our strategic direction is to provide choices and interoperability between choices,"" said one HP executive, called on by Platt and other HP executives to answer a question on whether HP will continue to support Novell Inc.'s directory services, as announced last week.   HP executives have stressed that the company wants to stay clear of the battles raging between Microsoft and Silicon Valley companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. But David Tremblay, an analyst at Computer Intelligence/ Infocorp, said the next year may bring confusion for HP's customers if, for example, its neutrality prevents HP from making firm recommendations on software suppliers. The deal also strikes a blow for HP rival Digital Equipment Corp, which has worked with Microsoft on Windows NT for five years. Digital's speedy Alpha chip is the only 64-bit microprocessor that currently runs NT.   ""The strength of HP is really quite impressive,"" Gates said in response to a question about how the deal may affect Microsoft's alliance with Digital. ""We've got a lot of breadth here."" The demand for services and support for NT now exceeds what has been available on the market before the deal with HP, which has a wide array of reseller partners, Gates said. ""Digital's jumping up and down about NT, but they're not exactly blowing the doors off of it,"" one analyst said.   The growth of Windows NT is building steam, according to Gates, who showed a slide in which sales of Windows NT Server licenses were approaching 250,000 in the fourth quarter of 1996, up from around 150,000 in the first quarter last year. ""HP is pragmatic, if nothing else,"" said Scott Miller, an analyst at Dataquest. But he cautioned that HP faced a challenge as it drew more technologgy from partners such as Intel and Microsoft, making it more difficult for the company to ""own the customer"" as closely as in the past.

"Boeing Co on Tuesday signed a $685 million contract to sell jets to China with Vice President Al Gore on hand, signalling a boost in business relations after Beijing only a year ago had turned to European rival Airbus. Boeing and Chinese aviation officials inked a contract for five 777-200 jets in a ceremony at the cavernous Great Hall of the People, also attended by Chinese Premier Li Peng. Under the accord, Chinese state-run international carrier Air China will take delivery of the planes in 1998 and 1999. ""Air China's order is a vote of confidence in the world's best-selling airplane in its market,"" said Ronald Woodard, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. Woodard told reporters both sides had reached basic agreement a year ago, but signing faced lengthy delays because of political differences between China and the United States. ""There is no doubt the contract was not executed when it was ready because of tension between the U.S. and China last year and the year before,"" he told reporters at a news briefing after the ceremony. ""There are times when politics are involved,"" he said. A year ago, China and the United States were at odds over a range of issues from trade and human rights to Beijing's sabre-rattling over Taiwan. Chinese Premier Li Peng was also on hand when Beijing turned to the European consortium Airbus Industrie in April last year, buying 30 airliners in a $1.5 billion deal. Since then, Sino-U.S. tensions have eased as the two sides have made painstaking efforts to patch up their differences. The Gore visit is aimed at ensuring that trend continues. Gore is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then-president George Bush travelled to Beijing in early 1989 -- just months before a crackdown on democracy protests in the Chinese capital's Tiananmen Square. Boeing officials tried to play down last minute questions about whether Gore would attend the signing ceremony, saying there never was any doubt. ""I was told he'd be there and he was,"" said Woodard. U.S. officials and Boeing were non-committal as late as on Monday about Gore's plans. The Clinton administration has been on the defensive over accusations of illegal Chinese contributions to the Democratic Party. China has angrily denounced the allegations, insisting that it did not make any payments and saying that rival Taiwan may be behind its current difficulties. The Washington Post has said the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six members of Congress last year that they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign contributions from foreign corporations. Boeing officials said they hoped the United States would take further steps to keep the relationship healthy. ""We strongly and fully support granting China permanent Most Favoured Nation status and China's accession to the World Trade Organisation. Both are critical to achieving normalised world trade,"" Woodard said. China has sought permanent preferential trade status from the United States to avoid an annual review. It has also pushed for entry into the global trade body, but Washington has insisted that Beijing agree to liberalise more of its trade policies first. Boeing walked away from the latest contract signing ceremony with a bit less than it wanted. Company officials said they had been hoping to sell 10 of the 777s to China. They said, however, this was a commercial decision and they were hopeful of further orders in the future. ","WilliamKazer"
"Workers striking two Johnson Control Inc. seat assembly plants Tuesday scored a major victory when Ford Motor Co. said it would refuse to accept non-union made seats until the dispute is resolved. ""We had a huge, huge victory here today,"" Bob King, director of United Auto Worker Region 1A, told a boisterous crowd of strikers and supporters outside of the plant in Plymouth, Mich., a suburb west of Detroit. More than 300 workers at the plant walked off the job at 6 a.m. Tuesday after talks on a new contract broke down late Monday. The strike drew hundreds of other chanting supporters. About 200 employees of a Johnson Controls seat plant in Oberlin, Ohio, also struck the company when their talks collapsed. Workers at both plants agreed last fall to be represented by the UAW in a new labour contract. The Plymouth plant provides final assembly for seats that go into Ford's hot-selling Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, which is made at the nearby Michigan Truck plant in Wayne, Mich. The Ohio plant makes seats for Ford's Econoline full-size vans. Johnson Controls officials did not return telephone calls. In a statement, the company said it will make ""every effort"" to continue seat production at both plants, including hiring temporary and permanent replacement workers, if necessary. Representatives from Ford said they had to consider their own union workforces when they were affected by supplier disputes. Ford is generally regarded as having the best labour relations of Detroit's Big Three. ""We're not accepting seats made by the non-union employees of Johnson Controls,"" said Ford spokesman Bill Carroll. As of midday Tuesday, no new talks were scheduled. UAW spokesman Karl Mantyla said the union was seeking wage parity with other seat suppliers, such as Lear Corp. which pays hourly wages of $14 to $16. Mantyla would not say what Johnson offered, but said the company ""did not get close to that."" The UAW is also pressing for resolution of unfair labour practice claims. After workers agreed to be represented by the UAW, Mantyla said Johnson dropped its entry pay rate to $9 an hour from $9.50, cut out a 401(k) retirement plan, and barred union supporters from displaying UAW buttons at company meetings. In its statement, the company said the UAW rejected what Johnson termed a reasonable and fair offer. ","ToddNissen"
"Comerica Inc. said Wednesday it will cut 1,890 jobs, or about 16 percent of its work force, as part of an effort to slash costs and boost revenues by $110 million annually by the first half of 1998. The Detroit-based banking company said the restructuring actions caused it to incur a $90 million pretax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings, which fell to $60.8 million, or 52 cents a share, from $106.5 million, or 92 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Comerica, with $34 billion in assets at the end of 1996, said the actual number of employees to be laid off may be less than 1,890 because of attrition, a hiring freeze and reinvestment actions. The company has about 12,000 employees in Michigan, Texas, California and Florida. The cuts will fall in all four states and will take place between now and mid-1998, Comerica said. ""Regrettably, as we streamline processes and eliminate redundancies, a number of employees throughout the corporation will be displaced,"" Comerica Chairman Eugene Miller said in a statement. ""To assist these employees, we have put in place an enhanced severance plan with out placement services to help their transition."" Comerica also said it planned to close about a dozen branch offices. Comerica, Michigan's largest independent bank holding company, has been the subject of merger speculation in the past year. However, it has steadfastly maintained it is not interested in being acquired by an out-of-state bank and has instead embarked on a long effort to streamline its operations. Comerica said the third phase of its restructuring effort includes other initiatives to reduce costs and enhance revenues. They include: -- Eliminating one-third of paper forms and replacing them with electronic forms. -- Simplifying the referral and delivery of investment services. -- Giving branch employees more authority and reducing their clerical duties so they can serve customers better. -- Reducing the documentation required to open a new account. -- Streamlining the credit approval process. -- Streamlining financial and operations reporting. For the full year, Comerica earned $417.2 million, or $3.55 a share, up from $413.4 million, or $3.54 a share, in 1995. ","DavidLawder"
"British electricity company Northern Electric brought forward half year results and gave year forecasts on Friday in a bid to prove it is undervalued by CE Electric's 630 pence a share bid. The regional electricity company, or Rec, said pretax profits for the six months ending September 30 slipped to 50.7 million pounds ($85.12 million) from 58.7 million pounds and an interim dividend of 12.85 pence was paid out, up from 12 pence. Full year pretax profits would be above 112 million pounds, the company said, with a final dividend forecast of 29.85 pence. Northern, which last year fended off a bid from Trafalgar House, now part of Kvaerner, with a 560 million pound benefit package, said gearing should fall to 95 percent by March 31 compared with forecasts last year of 175 percent. ""Gearing is falling and that is good news...today's results were not about profits but about the financial state of Northern Electric,"" said one trader. Northern's chairman David Morris told Reuters there would be more information to come, pointing out prospects and highlighting areas of value. He said talks with CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., would be based on a share price of around 700 pence, a level it claims the American company indicated before the bid was launched in October. CE Electric denied that claim and went on to snap up nearly 30 percent of Northern as its shares languished, weighed by concerns that the U.K. government will block the bid. A spokesman for CE Electric described Northern's results as ""lacklustre."" ""I do not think they have announced anything that is going to make CE Electric put its price up,"" said one sector analyst who asked not to be identified. Shares in the Rec slipped one penny to 589 pence by 1100 GMT. Northern said gearing, without payment of a special dividend of 56.5 pence due in February under last year's defence package, would be roughly in line with other electricity companies. It argued that based on the forecast cash flow for 1997, it should be valued at 745 pence a share to balance the current agreed bid for Rec East Midlands Electricity from Dominion Resources of the U.S. That bid valued East Midlands at 670 pence per share but its stock was also dampened by government approval worries and was trading at 609 pence, up 1.5 pence. ""We are simply pointing out the value of Northern Electric,"" Morris said, adding that if the government approved the bid, the figures would be more fully appreciated. ""You will see a vast change then,"" Morris said. Northern has said it felt the government should approve the bid but maintained that 630 pence did not represent its true value. ""These results and forecasts help to demonstrate that there is significant further value within Northern Electric, value which CE Electric's offer fails to reflect,"" Morris said. Some analysts said the results and forecasts underlined the judgement that CE Electric's bid undervalued the company. ""The company is worth something around 670 pence, if you exclude the bid premium and shareholders should hold out for something nearer 700 pence,"" said one analyst, anonymously.

"Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc, which set records for sales, profit and beer volume in 1996, said Wednesday it continues to aim for a double-digit percentage increase in its earnings per share in 1997. ""Our projection for this year is double-digits...EPS growth,"" W. Randolph ""Randy"" Baker, chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. Anheuser, which brews Budweiser and Michelob beer, earned $2.21 a share from continuing operations in 1996, up 11 percent from $1.99 in 1995, both before extraordinary items.   For the fourth quarter, it earned $0.30 a share, in line with analysts' expectations, compared with earnings from continuing operations, and excluding charges, of $0.27 a share in the 1995 fourth quarter. The year-ago fourth quarter results exclude $160.0 million in costs for closing a Tampa, Fla., brewery and $74.5 million in costs for wholesale inventory reductions. ""As we end 1996 and begin 1997, we do so in a position of great competitive strength and we have set the stage for significant long-term earnings growth for 1997,"" Baker said.   Gross sales for 1996, before excise taxes, were a record $12.6 billion in 1996, up four percent from 1995. Anheuser said it sold a record 91.1 million barrels of beer in 1996, up 4.1 percent from 1995. Adjusting for an inventory reduction in 1995, beer volume grew 2.8 percent. The company also boosted its leading domestic market share in 1996 by 1.1 points to 45.2 percent. ""The volume growth remains very, very good,"" Oppenheimer and Co analyst Roy Burry said. ""That's the problem."" With Anheuser being the only U.S. major brewer to gain market share, competition has intensified, Burry said.   In spite of the increased competition, Baker said Anheuser implemented about a three percent price increase, equal to $0.10 to $0.15 per six-pack of beer, in much of the United States this month. This followed a similar price increase in seven states in September and October of 1996. He said it is too soon to tell if the price increases are holding. But preliminary reports indicate Anheuser's major competitors are following the price move on their premium brands in a majority of markets, he added. Internationally, Anheuser reaped a double-digit increase in sales volume in 1996, Baker said, continuing a trend for this business. International brewing profit dropped slightly in 1996 compared to 1995, due in part to increased marketing expenses. Anheuser has been building its overseas beer business with ventures and investments in foreign brewers. In December, it increased its ownership in Grupo Modelo SA de CV to 37 percent for an investment of about $550 million. The company said its Busch Entertainment theme park subsidiary made a significant contribution to earnings in 1996, with its fifth consecutive year of record attendance and profitability.

"Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Wednesday greeted future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa with a pledge of support, saying the appointment of the tycoon turned chief executive designate marked the dawn of new era. ""Of course, I will support him,"" Jiang told reporters during a meeting in Beijing with Tung, who will lead the British colony after it returns to Chinese rule on July 1 next year. ""This is indeed the start of a new era,"" he said. Tung, a shipping magnate who will become Hong Kong's first Chinese chief executive after more than 150 years of colonial rule from London, was in Beijing to meet senior leaders after his formal appointment on Monday by Premier Li Peng. The visit is being keenly watched by residents in the territory eager to know more about Tung's plans for his first post-colonial adminstration and to learn whether current senior civil servants will keep their jobs. Tung, who has warned Hong Kong's people to be sensitive to China's sovereign rights, has yet to give details of his plans for the post-colonial administration but has said he will discuss transition issues during his Beijing visit. He declined to answer questions from reporters on the position of civil servants before beginning talks with Jiang in Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People. It was Jiang who in January signalled that the tycoon was China's favourite for chief executive by singling him out for a warm, personal handshake at a reception in Beijing. A 400-member, Beijing-controlled Selection Committee of Hong Kong residents last week made the choice official when a sweeping 80 percent majority of members backed the 59-year-old tycoon. At a meeting at Beijing's Diaoyutai state guest house, Premier Li Peng gave Tung a certificate of appointment and congratulated him on his success. ""This is indeed an historic moment,"" Li told reporters. Earlier on Wednesday, Tung met Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at the guesthouse, but neither he nor Qian made any public comment. One of Tung's first tasks in the twilight of British rule will be to put together an advisory cabinet called the Executive Council and to decide which senior civil servants to keep -- a subject of much speculation among Hong Kong's boisterous media. While heated interest has focused on Tung's intentions for current senior administrators, China said on Tuesday that it would make the final decision on important civil servants. ""For senior officials, they need the nomination of the top administrative official and to finally obtain appointment by the central government,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said at a news briefing. China has hailed Tung's appointment as the fruit of its principle of Hong Kong autonomy, but the selection process was dogged by protests from democrats who accuse Beijing of using its hand-picked committee to stage-manage the choice. Beijing's critics believe it is likely try to control Hong Kong and its 6.3 million people from behind the scenes after the five-star Chinese flag is raised over the territory. The Beijing-backed Selection Committee that chose Tung is now preparing for the selection on Saturday of a 60-member, ""provisional legislature"" with which China plans to replace the existing, elected legislature on July 1. Hong Kong's colonial governor Chris Patten has condemned the new legislature as undemocratic and has vowed not to cooperate with it. ","MureDickie"
"Taiwan has stepped forward in the delicate run-up to Hong Kong's reversion to China and rejected once more the ""one country, two systems"" policy guiding the territory's July 1 handover to mainland rule. In a souvenir edition of the Far Eastern Economic Review, Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui wished Hong Kong well after its return to China but repeated his island's determination never to unify with China under the same terms. ""We hope that Hong Kong will not only preserve its present system of freedom, democracy and openness, but enjoy further development after 1997,"" Lee said in a paid advertisement. ""However, the (Taiwan) government cannot accept the 'one China, two systems' formula imposed on Hong Kong by Peking (Beijing), because the state of division across the Taiwan Strait differs categorically from Hong Kong's situation."" The statement, a striking reminder of the China-Taiwan issue at a sensitive moment, followed Taiwan's confirmation of annual wargames on June 23-24 in the Taiwan Strait, the scene last year of a tense stand-off between the ""two Chinas"". Communist Beijing has considered Taiwan a renegade province since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949 and the defeated Nationalists (Kuomintang) set up a rival government there. China staged eight months of war games near Taiwan in the run-up to the island's March 1996 presidential election, which Beijing suspected was a bid to pursue full independence. China fully intends to reclaim Taiwan, by force if necessary, and designed the ""one country, two systems"" policy with Taiwan -- not just Hong Kong -- in mind. But Taiwan, which calls itself the Republic of China, has ruled out unification until China's Communist Party gives up its political monopoly and introduces pluralism. Most political analysts said the ostensibly routine nature of Taiwan's summer military exercises was belied by their timing. Taiwan rejects any link between the wargames and Hong Kong's handover, but few Hong Kong commentators are convinced. ""The timing of the wargames is certainly related to the Taipei government's position on the Hong Kong issue and I think wargames have these political connotations,"" said Joseph Cheng, professor of political science at City University in Hong Kong. Michael DeGolyer, professor of political science at Baptist University in Hong Kong, said that the purpose of the exercises was to send a message. ""You have to ask yourself just how subtle is shooting off a bunch of rockets, but it does get across the clear statement that the ""one country, two systems"" formula by which Hong Kong is being returned to China does not apply to them,"" he said. Yet most analysts do not expect any major disruption, citing Taiwan's commitment to a smooth Hong Kong transition and the international community's awareness of issues in the strait. ""Will all this have a significant impact on the handover? No,"" said Richard Margolis, political analyst at broker Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. ""The scene is set for the handover. It will be full of symbolism but when the first of July rolls around the overall expectation is that it will be business as usual."" DeGolyer said that now was the wrong time for China to force the Taiwan issue. Although Taiwan originally topped China's reunification agenda, Britain's insistence on settling the Hong Kong issue has guaranteed that the next couple of years will be spent ensuring the territory is functioning well, he said. ""If there's any time at which we could consider the Taiwan issue to be the least likely to blow up in our face, this is probably it,"" DeGolyer said. But he warned that Chinese President Jiang Zemin had explicitly pledged to resolve the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, just as former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping stated his intention to settle Hong Kong during his tenure.

"China urged the United States on Wednesday to grant it permanent Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status, despite U.S. congressional doubts over whether Beijing will keep its promises on recovering Hong Kong. ""Granting China permanent MFN status is good for the healthy development of Sino-U.S. relations,"" an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said. ""We will never change our position and attitude to the United States."" Chinese hopes of winning over Washington from its annual review on renewal of MFN appeared to fade this week as visiting U.S. Congressman Jim Kolbe said China was unlikely to win permanent MFN status this year. ""I do not believe this year we will grant permanent MFN status to China,"" the Arizona Republican said on Tuesday. U.S. concerns over whether China will keep its promise to leave Hong Kong untouched after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule this year would slow Beijing's hopes, he said. ""We want to monitor Hong Kong for a year before we make any change,"" Kolbe told reporters in Beijing. President Bill Clinton would have to certify the move in June. China recovers sovereignty at midnight on June 30. MFN grants China the same tariff treatment accorded other U.S. trading partners. ""The U.S. annual review of MFN status is totally wrong,"" said an official at MOFTEC's research institute. ""It is a product of the Cold War,"" said the official who declined to be identified. ""Times have changed, but the United States still sticks to this view. It is unreasonable."" China hailed Clinton's decision in 1995 to delink the annual renewal of MFN from China's human rights record. Beijing has since been pushing hard for the United States to end the whole annual review process that precedes renewal of MFN status to China and to grant permanent rights. ""China's attitude is clear, that these benefits should be granted mutually,"" the research institute official said. ""This is not some kind of special favoured treatment that they gave us. This is part of normal trade relations so it is not necessary to review it every year,"" he said. ""Our position is determined, you must give us this every year and do not need to review it,"" he said, adding that U.S. business groups were also opposed to the review system. Some U.S. senators have urged Washington to grant China permanent MFN status on grounds the annual review was a disadvantage to the United States and caused uncertainty to business. The doubts over Hong Kong were unlikely to interrupt a smiling campaign by Chinese leaders after President Jiang Zemin granted a rare meeting meeting to Kolbe and other members of the U.S. House of Representatives to try to boost ties with the American Congress. Beijing and Washington have been trying to mend ties that were badly strained by a series of disputes over the last two years ranging from Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province, to trade and human rights. Last November, Jiang and Clinton agreed on an exchange of presidential visits in 1997 and 1998, which would be the first since President George Bush came to China in early 1989. ","JaneMacartney"
"Czech President Vaclav Havel said on Wednesday he felt more deeply about the world after facing the possibility of death when he underwent major surgery to remove a cancerous lung tumour a month ago. ""In the year we have just dismissed, I have faced death twice. First when it came for my closest being and second when it swirled around my hospital bed,"" he said in a New Year address on national television. Speaking publicly for the first time since the December 2 operation, Havel reflected on his illness and the loss of his wife Olga to cancer last January. The former playwright, looking thinner, said both events had caused great suffering and made him feel the world was unjust. ""But on the other hand both of these experiences, to my own surprise, I have perceived as great challenges for a new and far deeper consideration of the world in which we live,"" said Havel. He said he had thought ""about myself, about the mysterious order of human existence, and about the volume of signs or hidden messages which are speaking to us from within this order, which we are mostly ignoring."" Havel, the chain-smoking leader of Prague's bloodless 1989 overthrow of Communist rule, entered a clinic on November 25 with what his office called a case of pneumonia. A week later doctors performed exploratory surgery and found a small malignant tumour in his lungs. Surgeons decided to operate immediately and said later it appeared the cancer had been caught at an early stage and had not spread. But Havel, 60, developed pneumonia in his lungs soon afterwards and fought off a high fever, the seriousness of which is only now coming to light. For a while he was on a respirator connected through his throat but was released from hospital the day after Christmas. Doctors have said Havel's condition has been steadily improving and that his prospects for a full recovery were good. The just under eight-minute address, which he made in a business suit sitting at a desk in his private west Prague villa, replaced his traditional and normally much longer New Year's speech. Havel called for a deeper understanding of common goals in Czech society. He said 1996 had brought many ""important, beautiful, and painful"" things to the Czech public. The year was tainted by the failure of several banks, political spats and corruption cases which had emerged from the country's massive post-Communist privatisation programme and economic reforms. ""I implore you...to try to understand all of these ugly things as warning signs calling us all to a newer and deeper consideration of the sense of our common affairs,"" he said. Havel thanked all who had supported him through his illness and said he hoped Czechs could still rely on him. The Czech news agency CTK reported on Wednesday that Havel's staff at Prague Castle had agreed to stop smoking in the office in a show of solidarity with the president, who has been advised by doctors to give up his several packs a day habit.

"Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's dispute with suspended star fund manager Nicola Horlick highlights a ""merry-go-round"" hiring system started by investment banks, banking sources said on Wednesday. ""One of the industry's failings is that it doesn't bring people up through the system. When a firm needs someone, it steals people from a competitor. This creates a destructive merry-go-round which can't be in anyone's interests,"" one banker said. Newspapers said DMG suspended Horlick on Tuesday because she allegedly tried to lure colleagues at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, where she was head of UK pension fund business, to join her in a move to Dutch bank ABN AMRO. ABN AMRO itself denied reports that the 35-year-old Horlick was poised to lure a team with her and DMG has declined to comment on the details of Horlick's suspension, except to say it centred on a potential breach of contract. While the term ""poaching"" is widely used to describe the movement of teams from one firm to another, loyal colleagues following a key player to a new employer is nothing new, the banking sources said. Most moves involve a significant salary and bonus rise and often swiftly follow payment of bonuses by the firm which an individual is leaving. Banking sources said U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs, reported to have paid record bonuses last year, had lost a handful of staff since the payments were made. In suspending Horlick, DMG, the investment banking arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank, has brought back into the open a subject often seen as a normal part of the rough and tumble associated with investment banking -- but which might be relatively new to the more staid world of fund management, the sources said. ""We are surprised to be mentioned in the context of poaching which would, by its nature, imply you are planning to take a whole team, which we are not,"" ABN AMRO chief spokesman Jules Prast told Reuters. But he said he preferred not to discuss whether ABN AMRO had talked to or planned to talk to Horlick, who newspaper reports said had earned more than 500,000 pounds ($835,000) a year. ""She (Horlick) had certainly led a number of people in the (MGAM) division to think that she had ABN AMRO lined up,"" one banking source told Reuters. But if Horlick was about to take a team of up to 20 fund managers with her to ABN AMRO, which is expanding its fund management activities in London, she might have given DMG a dose of its own medicine. The investment bank has gained a reputation in recent years for an aggressive hiring spree aimed at top performers at other firms, which led to widespread suggestions that DMG was offering guaranteed bonuses -- some for up to two years -- to ensure that it got the staff it wanted. This came to a head last July when DMG reached agreement with another Dutch firm, ING Barings, the investment banking division of Internationale Nederlanden Groep, over a separate poaching dispute. ING Baring's chief executive, Hessel Lindenbergh, said at the time there was ""growing resistance and irritation in the industry towards firms which deliberately poach whole teams"" and that ""poaching teams pushes up pay unduly"". Last year, DMG's global bonds chief Edson Mitchell said the firm had hired around 500 people since he left his previous firm Merrill Lynch. Many of the new staff came from Merrill, while others moved from the then S.G. Warburg arm of SBC Warburg. ($1=.5976 Pound) ","AlexanderSmith"
"Kellogg Co, whose profits for 1996 are under pressure from price cuts and promotions, threw down the gauntlet that it will take the necessary steps to preserve its category leadership, which may mean further discounts, analysts said. ""They (Kellogg) might cut prices again or increase promotions again,"" said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach. On Wednesday, Chairman Arnold Langbo said Kellogg will direct its efforts away from deep price promotion.   ""..However, we are unwilling to see our leadership position compromised,"" Langbo added in a statement. Earlier this year, Kellogg, General Mills Inc and the Post Cereal division of Philip Morris Cos Inc cut retail prices in an effort to spark a sluggish category. ""On balance consumers want lower prices still,"" Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz said. ""They'll either get that in the form of lower list prices or extraordinarily high levels of promotion.""   While many analysts had expected Kellogg to report earnings below last year's $3.48 a share, the magnitude of the potential decline did come as a surprise for some. ""Their guidance has been much different,"" added Leach, who had been projecting full-year earnings of $3.15 a share. In July, analysts said Kellogg was still guiding them that earnings for 1996 would match 1995 levels. According to First Call, the consensus for 1996 earnings has been $3.35 a share, with a range of $3.15 to $3.50.   Kellogg said it now believes earnings for the third quarter will be about 20 percent below the $1.05 per share earned in the 1995 period. It added that while earnings per share will grow in the fourth quarter, results for the full year will be less than $3.48 a share. Kellogg said its results for the third quarter were hurt by competitive promotions in the U.S. cereal category. In a report issued in late August, BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said there had been a disparity in promotional spending among major cereal manufacturers. Post, he said, continued some discounting and General Mills maintained an Olympics-themed promotion while Kellogg reduced promotion efforts after cutting prices. ""The impact was a loss of market share"" for Kellogg, O'Neil wrote. Reuters Chicago Newsdesk - 312-408-8787 ","PatriciaCommins"
"Underwriters to the heavily under-subscribed Stadium Australia float would not seek to cut their losses and sell the unbought passes at a discount ahead of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, Stadium Australia chairman Peter Ritc hie said on Wednesday. Ritchie told Reuters the underwriters would seek to sell the approximately A$200 million worth of unsold passes over the next couple of years at prices above the float's offer prices. ""They have a couple of years and they're super-confident that they'll sell them and maybe even get more for them between now and the Games,"" Ritchie said in an interview. ""Our existing gold members are of course concerned that they (the passes) may be discounted and I can assure them that that won't happen because as the Games get closer there'd be more recognition that the prime seats that go with the gold packages wi ll get more and more valuable,"" he said. Earlier, Ritchie confirmed market speculation of a A$200 million-plus shortfall in the A$364.4 million float of Stadium gold and platinum passes. The 35,000 passes offered included packages of main stadium tickets to the 2000 Olympics, a 30-year stadium membership and an equity stake in the stadium itself. ""My rough top-of-the-head calculation is that it is about 40 percent (sold),"" he said. The underwriters, ANZ Securities, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Macquarie Bank Ltd and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, are not due to announce the exact results of the float until this Friday. They must fund the project regardless of whether all the packages are sold, thus guaranteeing the completion of the 110,000-seat stadium, which is due to open in 1999 in time for a season of pre-Olympic competitions. The Stadium Australia float, which closed last Thursday, had been open for almost six months, more than twice as long as most share offers. Its offer of 34,400 gold packages at A$10,000 each and 600 platinum passes at A$33,000 each opened on October 7 and its closing date has been extended twice due to lack of demand. Brokers said the float had been too complicated for investors to generate enough enthusiasm. Ritchie acknowledged the underwriters had been over-confident and that its structure may have been difficult. He said the underwriters were targeting a sharemarket listing for the stapled stadium shares and memberships around April 11. Once the stadium was opened in 1999 however, the stadium shares and the stadium memberships would be unstapled and be traded separately. Ritchie said the stadium would manage a private market for the stadium memberships, similar to those managed for other Australian stadiums like the Melbourne and Sydney Cricket grounds. He said he expected the new Sydney stadium memberships would be worth more than those for these other grounds. ""There's no reason to think that our memberships won't sell for more than their's because our facilities are so much better and we'll know then who the hirees (sporting group users) are."" He said Stadium Australian already had strong expressions of interest from the Australian Football League (AFL) which runs the Victorian-based Australian rules competition. ""Strangely enough when it's not really their territory, they've been the most enthusiastic and then we'd have to reconfigure the stadium specification for an oblong field."" Ritchie said the stadium would be designed with mobile stands so after the Olympics the stadium could be converted into an oval easily. ""You put the big stands on wheels and you roll them back for the oval."" Stadium Australia had also had talks with the major winter sporting codes in New South Wales, Rugby Union and Rugby League. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 (c) Reuters Limited 1997 ","BernardHickey"
"Apple Computer Inc. reported a $708 million second-quarter loss Wednesday, reflecting a charge for the layoff of a third of its employees and weaker sales of its personal computers, Apple said, however, that strong sales of new, speedy PCs and laptops and lower expenses would help the company meet its goal of reporting a profit by its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in September. The Cupertino, Calif.-based computer company's net loss, equivalent to $5.64 a share, for the fiscal quarter ended March 28 compared with a net loss of $740 million, or $5.99 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Apple's loss from operations of $186 million, or $1.48 a share, was worse than the consensus industry analyst forecast of $1.22 a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst forecasts. The $708 million net loss included a $155 million charge to cover the cost of layoffs and a $375 million charge for the acquisition of software developer Next Software Inc. Apple said, however, that it expects to see higher revenue and a reduced operating loss in the third quarter as its restructuring program takes hold. In March, the company said it would lay off 4,100 employees and reorganize operations to cut costs. ""Don't open champagne bottles yet, but the process seems to be working,"" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. During the quarter, Apple introduced a jazzy laptop and a speedy desktop machine for small businesses, schools and homes. Sales of the new machines have been strong, the company said. ""We feel the worst is behind us and our strategy is on track,"" Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio said in a telephone conference call with analysts. He said sales will probably increase in the third quarter over the second and that the company probably will meet its goal of being profitable again by the fourth quarter. Still, even with better financial health, Apple faces serious problems, analysts said. The number of Apple computers shipped worldwide in the second quarter plunged 33 percent to 602,000 units, compared with 892,000 units in the same quarter a year ago. The drop was bigger than most analysts expected. Sales in Japan and Europe also were weak, Apple executives said in the conference call. ""I want to see a couple of positive quarters before I say they're beginning to turn the corner,"" said Michael Kwatinetz, analyst at the DMG Technology Group investment bank in New York. To keep costs in line with declining sales, Apple in the past year has laid off more than 5,000 employees. The company also has seen its entire management suite change in 15 months. The uncertainty about the company's future still is keeping customers away from the Mac aisle at stores, analysts said. Dataquest, which tracks PC sales worldwide, says Apple's share of the worldwide market fell to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent. The slide left Apple's market share at the lowest point in three years. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Shares in French resorts company Club Mediterranee jumped almost 20 percent on Monday as investors welcomed the appointment of the head of Euro Disney to lead the ailing group. Club Med announced on Friday that it was replacing chairman Serge Trigano with Philippe Bourguignon, head of the Disneyland Paris theme park, and surprised the market with a net loss for the 1995-96 year of 743 million francs ($131.3 million). ""Bourguignon knows the business well. He has credibility...he is probably one of the best guys to choose,"" analyst Thibaut Simonnet at broker Ferri said. Bourguignon is credited with turning round the fortunes of Disneyland Paris in the last two years after it suffered heavy initial losses since opening in 1992 due to hostile French media reports and an indifferent public. Club Med shares closed up 21 percent at 431, on volume of 1.3 million shares, while the stock market as a whole was up 0.2 percent. Bourguignon, who takes up the new post in March, has 14 years' experience at hotels group Accor and gained valuable experience from Euro Disney, Simonnet said. Simonnet forecast a pretax pre-exceptional profit for Club Med in 1996-97 of 200 million francs and held his ""buy"" recommendation on the company. That forecast still represented a thin operating margin of 2.5 percent on annual turnover of eight billion francs. Another French brokerage, Oddo, upgraded the stock to ""overweight"" from ""underweight"" and noted Bourguignon had managed to triple gross operating profit at Euro Disney in three years and boost sales by a fifth. Oddo upgraded its forecast earnings per share for 1996-97 to 11.1 francs from a previous estimate of 12.3 francs and to 22.7 francs for 1997/98 from 18.5. Bourguignon steps in at an opportune time as Club Med has set aside 820 million francs in restructuring provisions to pay for the closure of seven holiday villages and 100 head office job losses. The provisions will make it easier for Club Med to return to profit in 1997, analysts said. It is simplifying marketing by dropping its mid-range ""Trident"" product and offering only Club Med at the upper end of the market and Club Aquarius at the lower end. It stands to make some money from the planned sale of a minority stake in an Italian business but will not get anything from disposing of its loss-making cruise liners. The company still enjoys a strong brand and has a strong financial structure, with an acceptable debt/equity ratio of 60 percent, analysts say. The expiry of a cross-shareholding pact means the company is open to outside investors. It remains to be seen how employees react to the arrival of Bourguignon as a professional manager in the place of Trigano, whose family founded the company and ran it as a family business even though it no longer owned Club Med.

"Live Picture Inc., the California photography software company headed by former Apple Computer Inc. Chief Executive John Sculley, will on Monday launch its first photo imaging product for consumers. The product, called LivePix, will be available in retail stores for under $100 and will enable home personal computer users to stretch or enhance pictures, stick on disguises or drag and drop them into other digital photos for printing. The product is also available through the LivePix home page at http://www.livepix.com. Sculley, who joined the Soquel, Calif.-based firm as president and chief executive in January, said in an interview that the technology for the first time enables individuals and families to use professional-quality digital picture editing techniques on their own home computers. ""We think that PC photography is really going to be one of the exciting emerging markets,"" said Sculley, whose company has minority equity investment from such industry heavyweights Eastman Kodak Co. and Broderbund Software. The technology allows people to add special effects, such as changing colouring, skewing images or distoring them, and to compose graphics such as greeting cards and calendars which incorporate pictures and text. LivePix, like the company's Live Picture product for professionals, uses FlashPix technology the company pioneered to allow speedy, high resolution photo viewing and printing. Instead of moving the tiny pixels used to create computer monitor images about, a task Sculley describes as taking ""an excruciating long time to move on the screen"" FlashPix uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to speed processing. While Sculley noted that older technology could take a half an hour or more to move rotate and manipulate a photographic image, or requires movement of low grade images to improve speed, FlashPix moves pictures rapidly. This is one feature which is expected to help speed adaptation in the market of digital editing technology. Although digital cameras remain expensive -- at around $350 to $800 for entry-level models -- and image quality for these is still below that of film cameras, the industry expects consumers to take advantage of the increasing availability of services which will digitize film images. Sculley said Live Picture has also been working with other industry leaders, such as Hewlett-Packard Co. which is a dominant force in computer printing technology, to develop and expand a market which is now in its embroyonic stages. Sculley noted that three are more than 60 billion photographs taken every year, but only some 2 percent of those are ever duplicated or used again, providing a wide-open market for people to add new, digitally-enhanced flourishes. ""What we really want to do in the early stages is to establish the foundation,"" said Sculley, who predicted the market would really begin to heat up in the build up to Christmas 1997 a year from now. ""The technology is here now."" Sculley compares the advance and the consumer market potential with that of electronic publishing in the 1980s, when several major software companies such as Aldus and Adobe, which have since merged, thrived by significantly lowering the cost and ease of professional graphics. He also said the concentration of major high tech firms on the Internet will provide enormous new market potential. This week, for example, Live Picture has scheduled a briefing in conjunction with Hewlett-Packard, Eastman Kodak, Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.to discuss further plans for using its technology to publish and distribute photographic images on the Internet. Sculley said people will be able to include photographs in documents and send them in electronic mail. ""What makes this technology different from anything that's come before is it is totally open, it's available and has huge advantages in sending photos over the Internet,"" Sculley said. Microsoft is expected to introduce a product in the same general area soon, also using FlashPix technology, according to industry executives, and Sculley said competition would only help define and expand the market at this stage. ""What we really want to do is see FlashPix become the standard and see it grow,"" said Sculley, adding that Live Picture wrote most of the original technology behind it. Sculley, who left Apple in 1993 and served briefly as chief executive of Spectrum Information Technologies Inc. before a financial scandal surfaced at the small company, also has a New York-based venture capital business. In January, Sculley announced he had joined privately-held Live Picture, and had bought a piece of the company. He has declined to detail his holding, although he said holdings by key executives of Live Picture exceed that of the corporate investors. ","SamuelPerry"
"A top Beijing official said on Monday the city's former Communist Party boss Chen Xitong could be punished for dereliction of duty in a further disgrace for an official who was once among China's most influential men. However, more than a year of investigation into the man who presided over China's capital for most of the 1980s had uncovered no evidence of more serious wrongdoing, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa told reporters at a reception. ""He (Chen) is living very comfortably,"" the vice-mayor said. Chen was being held outside Beijing, pending completion of an investigation, Zhang said, but declined to give details. Hong Kong newspapers have reported that Chen was under house arrest in Inner Mongolia. Chen has not been seen in public since he stepped down as Beijing's Communist Party secretary in April 1995 after his protege, Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen, committed suicide after coming under investigation for corruption. ""Viewing the situation from the case of Wang Baosen, he (Chen) can't escape dereliction of duty,"" Zhang said, referring to what is usually an administrative punishment in China. Zhang said the former municipal party chief, who served as mayor of Beijing during the 1980s, had accepted many expensive gifts but there was no evidence of wrongdoing in exchange. Chen was sacked from the party's powerful Politburo in September 1995, becoming the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the puritan communists swept to power in 1949. Zhang dismissed as ""baseless"" a Hong Kong newspaper report that Chen would be sentenced to between five and seven years in prison. However, he signalled that the party, not prosecutors, would finally decide whether Chen would be indicted. ""It is up to the party central committee whether he is to be charged,"" Zhang said. The woman who was Chen's mistress for about six years remained on the run, Zhang said. It was not known if the woman, identified as He Ping, had fled abroad, he said. One of Chen's sons, Chen Xiaotong, former general manager of a Sino-Japanese joint venture hotel in Beijing, had been detained, Zhang said. The case of the father was not related to that of the son, who was under investigation for corruption and accepting bribes, the vice-mayor said. The case of Chen Xiaotong was also not related to that of another princeling, Zhou Beifang, who has received a suspended death sentence for corruption. Princelings are the sons and daughters of China's powerful ruling elite. Chen Xitong's wife was free and not under house arrest, Zhang said. Zhang said he and former Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan had been cleared of any wrongdoing because they had reported Chen's irregularities to the party leadership before the scandal surfaced. Li stepped down as Beijing mayor in October and has been appointed as a vice minister of labour. ","BenjaminKangLim"
"Stericycle Inc said it is comfortable with Wall Street estimates of an operating-basis break-even third quarter, a fourth-quarter operating profit and a profitable year for the first time in 1997. ""The Dillon Read report has us punching through on an operating profit in the fourth quarter of this year, with break-even at the operating line in the third quarter...We're very comfortable with a profitable year,"" chief executive Mark Miller said in an interview Tuesday with Reuters.   Stericycle lost $2.4 million, or $0.30 per share, in 1996. As for the possibility of moving into the black in the first quarter, Miller added: ""We're going to be pretty close."" In business since 1989, Deerfield, Ill.-based Stericycle has never turned a profit and its stock has languished below its $9 per share initial public offering price of last August. Shares were unchanged at eight on very light volume Tuesday. Boosted by a recent acquisition, accelerating internal growth and the withdrawal from the market of some key rivals, Stericycle looks to 1997 as a possible breakout year.   At its present run rate, Stericycle 1997 revenues would be ""north of $36 million,"" Miller said. Although 1996 revenues were just $24.5 million, Stericycle is the second-largest player in a $1 billion U.S. market from which larger competitors are fleeing. Houston's Browning-Ferris Industries Inc remains the largest medical waste handler, but BFI is selling assets as part of a back-to-basics restructuring. If BFI decided to exit, Miller said: ""We would obviously love to buy it.""   In December, Stericycle acquired the bulk of Waste Management's medical waste business for $11 million in cash and notes. Waste Management parent WMX Technologies Inc is also in the midst of a corporate restructuring. Canada's Laidlaw Inc is also in the process of separating itself from the medical waste business. The remainder of the market is divided among many smaller firms. ""We see ourselves as the best consolidator opportunity for the vast majority of sellers,"" Miller said.   More market share may become available to Stericycle beginning this summer as major hospitals with on-site waste incinerators confront new federal emission regulations. ""We think that will create new opportunities,"" he said. While hospitals remain Stericycle's core business, sales and marketing is focused on physician offices, nursing homes, laboratories, outpatient surgical centers and clinics. These smaller generators of waste present Stericycle with fatter profit margins and better growth opportunities as managed healthcare drives more medical procedures out of of acute care hospitals and into sub-acute facilities. ""These are the people that really need the outsourcing that we offer,"" Miller said. Alternate site business was up 59 percent in the fourth quarter year-over-year, while the core hospital business was up 13 percent in the fourth quarter. Partly as a result, the company's overall 1996 revenues grew 15 percent over 1995, while margins expanded 33 percent. ((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787)) ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"The Czech Republic recorded its first budget deficit, despite last ditch efforts by its fiscally-hawkish government to achieve its fourth consecutive surplus. The government a final effort in December when the budget looked headed for a more than five billion crown deficit, by freezing some outlays until 1997, and requiring early repayment on credit granted to a deposit insurance fund. But the measures were not enough and the Finance Ministry announced on Friday that definitive results show the budget ending 1996 with a deficit of 1.562 billion crowns. Ministry spokeswoman Ludmila Nutilova said revenues for the year totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.3 billion. The Czechs have had three year-end budget surpluses since Czechoslovakia split in 1993. Fiannce ministry officials have said that the deficit may edge up even further since more bills may be delivered after the deadline. The budget has been hampered continually by lower-than-expected tax revenue and delayed repayment on credits to Russia. The 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of spending cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns. Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome, but he was concerned with the effects government payment adjustments may have on the 1997 budget. Part of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which was due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the ""alpha and omega"" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus, made by the finance ministry soon after the new year, as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility. Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997. But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996. Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","AlanCrosby"
"Britain's building sector has finally shaken off one of its nastiest ailments, with strong evidence that the long and painful decline in the domestic housing market is now over and sales are on the up again. But celebrations failed to break out across the sector. Housebuilders may be set to reap the rewards of the recovery, but some of the biggest companies in the building industry on Friday continued to suffer from other afflictions. Building material giants like RMC Plc, Redland Plc and BPB saw their shares slide heavily on Friday due to continued problems in the key German market plus the pound's relentless rise against the mark and dollar which is eating into valuable export revenues. RMC ended 36p lower at 903.5. Redland closed 5.5p weaker at 330, BPB 13p off 362.5p and Blue Circle 7.5p off at 368. Optimistic reports of British housing starts at a seven-year high and earlier predictions of 1997 house price inflation of up to 10 percent were overshadowed by concerns about a continued deterioration in German GDP and higher unemployment. For these big building materials firms, analysts say the impact of Germany -- accounting for up to 40 percent of profits -- far outweighs the small upside from the British house sector. The second negative is the 10 percent appreciation in the pound against the mark over the last few months. Companies like Redland have already fired a warning signal on sterling's potential impact on profits. UBS building analyst Simon Brown summed up the gloom: ""Only a tiny proportion of the building material sector's business is in the UK. As a total of construction output, UK housing was 14 percent in 1995."" Looking at one of the biggest players in the sector, RMC, Brown said: ""Less than 20 percent of RMC's profit comes from the UK and an even smaller part from UK housing. So it is a tiny proportion of overall earnings."" Downgrades have haunted companies exposed to Germany and the pound. But one player which has escaped the pessimism and is tipped as a ""buy"" in light of the housing recovery is Caradon. Caradon is seen as the recovery stock, having slashed around 75 million pounds ($126 million) from costs in the last two years and rationalised its portfolio of businesses. Its profits are seen rising sharply this year and next. It has sizeable exposure to the British housing market, through its double glazing window and shower product range. It can also cash in on demand for building material supplies from Britain. ""It has the highest proportion of output linked to UK housing,"" said UBS' analyst Brown. ""Hepworth and Marley could also be worth a play,"" he said. Howard Seymour, an analyst at brokers BZW, said in a note that he recommended buying Tarmac and Redland -- but that building material firm BPB was classed a ""sell"". ""We argue that the sector is displaying late cycle characteristics as speculative supply is following demand which gives a robust profile to recovery over 1997."" He said that expected rises in British interest rates this year would ""take a back seat to profit recovery. Accordingly, investors should view the UK as their first choice for building materials investment over the next 12 months."" The main beneficiaries of the house market rebound will be housebuilder specialists. ""Those which were best at buying land will be the most serious winners - Berkeley, Persimmon, Barratt and Beazer,"" said Brown. ($1=.5950 Pound) ","EdnaFernandes"
"The soaring value of British medical devices company Biocompatibles Plc may be rushing ahead of itself, analysts said on Tuesday. Shares in the company, which is concentrating its skills in biomaterials on applications in contact lenses and heart surgery, have soared by up to 98 percent since the start of 1997 and by 265 percent in the past year, touching an all-time high of 14.35 stg on April 11. Although the shares have slipped back from this peak, trading at 13.60 pounds midafternoon on Tuesday, they have still outperformed the FT-SE All Share index by 68 percent since the start of the year, according to Reuters 3000 data. The surge in value has been built on hopes for Biocompatibles' specially-developed lubricious material, which produces very little reaction with human tissues. The product has so far led to the creation of a new type of soft contact lens, Proclear, which is targeted at people who suffer from dry eyes, and a coating for stents, which are inserted to expand furred-up arteries in the heart. Proclear, which has already been launched in Britain, won approval from U.S. regulators last week. Some analysts, notably Yamaichi International's Erling Refsum, believe there is a lot more to come in the share price, which Refsum said could hit the 20 stg mark by the end of the year. Refsum said the company is expected to sign three major licensing deals for its contact lenses, stents and a paint additives operation, all of which will help to drive sentiment. He forecasts pre-tax profits for the previously loss-making group of 17.5 million stg in 1998 after a small profit this year. Refsum said that despite a number of competitors, Biocompatibles' phosphocoline-based coatings appear to give its stents strong advantages over rivals, particularly in reducing the risk of thrombosis. Other analysts are more cautious, however. Nick Woolf of Nomura, who believes the shares are ""probably looking quite expensive,"" said ""the real value is in their stents business, and they have got to demonstrate that their product will deliver a demonstrable benefit,"" said Woolf. Henry Cooke Lumsden analyst Thomas Geimer, who also believes the shares are overvalued at present, said in a recent note that ""competitors are lurking round every corner."" Although Geimer believes the company will be able to achieve close to 10 million stg of stent sales this year, at 1,500 stg each, he said maintaining prices in a competitive market will be hard. Nomura's Woolf added ""it is not that we are negative"" on the stock. ""It is moving ahead too quickly."" -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","JonathanBirt"
"The boards of RightChoice Managed Care Inc and parent Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri are moving to calm relations with regulators, return to profitability and ensure company control is firmly in the hands of chief executive John O'Rourke. The three-pronged strategy was highlighted Tuesday when the boards said talks about a possible combination of RightChoice and BJC Health Systems had been halted, putting an end to a project conceived and launched last year by two top executives who were fired on Wednesday.   In an interview with Reuters, O'Rourke said the talks with BJC -- a St. Louis hospital organization -- were called off primarily for business reasons. ""It was clear as we proceeded in the discussion with BJC that the kind of deal that was being considered...would not be acceptable to the national Blue Cross association,"" he said. But he added that the boards of RightChoice and the Missouri Blues meant to show their support for him as well. ""The other part of the decision was...a vote of confidence in the company and in the management team that had just been hired to direct the company,"" he said.   RightChoice expects to return to profitability later this year. ""We're really projecting, at least at this point in time, that we will return to profitability by the third or fourth quarter,"" he said. The St. Louis-based company lost $3.7 million on revenues of $170.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $4.9 million on revenues of $154.6 million a year earlier. Wall Street registered its disapproval of the announcement of the halted BJC talks by driving shares in RightChoice down 3-1/2 to close Tuesday at 13-3/8.   On the day of the management shake-up, O'Rourke was in the office of Missouri Department of Insurance director Jay Angoff with an offer to make peace, he said. In May 1996, the Missouri Blues sued Angoff seeking a declaratory judgment that all applicable laws had been followed in the 1994 restructuring creating RightChoice. The Blues also sought a permanent injunction barring the department from taking certain actions against the company. In August, the department blocked a proposed share transaction in which RightChoice would have purchased 1.5 to 2.0 million of its own shares from the Blues.   Then on December 31, a Missouri judge ruled the Blues had ""abused or exceeded their legal authority"" in undertaking the reorganization that created RightChoice three years earlier. Heimburger vowed to fight the court ruling. Meanwhile, under his watch, RightChoice lost money in its third and fourth fiscal quarters. In February, O'Rourke was named chairman and chief executive of RightChoice, replacing Heimburger. O'Rourke had previously been president and chief executive of HealthLink Inc, which RightChoice acquired in 1995. ""I have a mandate from the board to...improve the profitability of the company, to improve the public image and to address our regulatory issues,"" O'Rourke said. The Missouri Blues' appeal of the December 31 court ruling is still pending and the share transaction proposal remains on hold, O'Rourke said. ((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787)) ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"The Czech cabinet will adopt a carrot-and-stick package mixing investment incentives with budget and import cuts in an attempt to spur economic growth, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Tuesday. With the cabinet due to announce its ""package"" of stimulus measures on Wednesday, share market repairs and savings promotion steps to reduce demand were most frequently mentioned by the nine analysts as likely to be included. The government said it aims to reduce growing budget and trade deficits, while spurring growth, dampening demand for imports and adding confidence to beleaguered capital markets. None of the analysts expected a direct manipulation of the exchange rate to help exports, although several suggested allowing the crown to ease below its corridor of plus/minus 7.5 percent from the mid-point of a mark/dollar basket. Josef Poeschl at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies, said lower interest rates were needed, but Merrill Lynch's Andrew Kenningham expects lower rates would be put off until more data on slowing growth is available. There was a consensus among the analysts that the cabinet should take steps to beef up market regulation with most saying a U.S.-style Securities and Exchange Commission would help bring back lagging foreign invesmtent. The analysts agreed sharp budget cuts were on the cards, as economic growth, and thus tax revenue, has come up short. Expectations ranged from 20 billion crowns in cuts seen as ""very likely"" by Boris Gomez and Susanne Hallergard at ING Barings, to 40-50 billion forecast by Kenningham. ""At least 25 billion crowns of cuts are needed to give good chance of a balanced budget,"" said Kennigham. ""Anything short of a balanced budget lacks credibility."" There was a broad consensus that state sector wages would be capped at 10 percent nominal growth -- Kenningham said that should save about 30 billion crowns this year -- and several expect pressure on the private sector to follow suit. Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka, said the government should seek a budget surplus of two to three percent of GDP, but more likely would move toward just a balance. Janacek, who works at the largest state-controlled bank, said the government must finish privatising big banks and industrial corporations. He said he expects the issuing of longer-term government bonds ""to increase the propensity to save in the household sector"" and for ""changes in legal and institutional framework enabling better functioning of the legal infrastructure"". Several said they expected longer-term state bonds to be issued aimed at attracting individual Czech retail investors to park their money for awhile, reducing demand. The group was mixed on the need to impose surcharges or quotas to reduce demand for imports which have thrown the current account deficit to more than 8.5 percent of GDP. Gomez and Hallergard said they expected ""seasonal"" import duties ""on selected foodstuffs and more stringent non-tariff trade barriers on imports, particulary from EU"" in the package. Poeschl said he expected some non-tariff barriers will be introduced on selected items and should be for a defined period of time, including plans for a gradual removal. Other key comments included: * Martin Kupka at Prague's Patria Finance said he expected ""considerable"" budget cuts, anti-import administrative measures and a rise in consumption taxes to dampen demand. * Matt Starr, bond trader at Creditanstalt Prague, said he expected a cap on wages, budget cuts, a move to separate invesment funds from banks -- an often-repeated problem in the capital markets -- and more support for the Export Guarantee and Insurance agency (EGAP) and state export bank. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003 ","JohnMastrini"

Cablevision is ""the primary potential acquirer,"" said one source close to ITT who declined to be identified.

"Scandal-tainted Nomura Securities Co Ltd said on Thursday that it could post parent current profits for the current business year despite expected penalties that would temporarily suspend some of its business. Analysts said, however, that the results at Japan's biggest brokerage for 1997/98 would hinge on when and how hard the Ministry of Finance (MOF) comes down on Nomura after regulators complete their investigation. Japanese prosecutors and the country's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Council (SESC), are currently investigating Nomura's suspected illegal stock deals linked to a ""sokaiya"" racketeer. Sokaiya extort money from companies by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings. The SESC is expected to recommend that MOF take punitive action against Nomura, and analysts said that whether Nomura posts a profit this year will depend on when a punitive suspension of operations would occur and how long it would last. ""If the SESC completes its investigation in May and the MOF's administrative punishment ends before the end of September, then Nomura would be able to escape the worst-case scenario,"" said Ayako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd. However, another analyst, who declined to be named, said if the punitive suspension continues into the second half of 1997/98, it might be difficult for Nomura to post a profit. ""If the investigation lasts a long time and the punishment affects Nomura's business in the latter half, it would seriously hurt earnings. It is possible for the company to post a loss,"" he said. But he added that if the punitive action does not affect business in the second half, it would be possible for Nomura to post a parent current profit of up to 50 billion yen.   Market sources said they expected the authorities could suspend Nomura's underwriting operations and stock dealing on its own account for up to three months as a penalty for the scandal. On Thursday, Takamichi Arata, a Nomura director, said at a news conference: ""Even if our business is suspended, we will be able to post profits in the current business year because of a cutback in expenditures in April and thereafter."" Analysts said, however, that speculation is growing that similar scandals may emerge at other big brokerages and this may delay investigations at Nomura. ""There is talk that the investigation will end after Japan's 'Golden Week' holiday (in the first week in May), but there is also speculation it may take a long time as regulators have started probes of similar wrongdoing at other big brokers,"" an analyst said. Under Japan's Securities and Exchange Law, the SESC could advise the finance minister to take punitive administrative action against Nomura if it finds evidence of illegal activity. The heaviest penalty would be the revocation of securities licences and the suspension of business for up to six months. MOF is currently awaiting the outcome of the investigation, a MOF official said, but he added that the focus is on whether Nomura violated the commercial code rather than securities law. Japanese commercial law prohibits payoffs to racketeers. The securities law bans discretionary transactions and the transfer of a broker's trading profits to the account of a client, both actions which Nomura said two of its directors were suspected of undertaking. James Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd, said he is rather optimistic, adding that Nomura's experience with a scandal in the early 1990s proved that the firm could quickly repair the damage caused by the latest dubious deals. ""In light of this, current forecasts that Nomura will take years to win back business and restore its reputation appear exaggerated,"" he said. In addition to its stock broking and underwriting business, Nomura is also highly influential in the yen bond market and is Japan's top seller of foreign bonds. ","FumikoFujisaki"
"AT&amp;T Corp, after recording a $200 million rise in bad debt and uncollectibles in the fourth quarter, sees a need for an industrywide drive to crack down on customers who fail to pay their telephone bills. ""It used to be if you don't pay your phone bill, you didn't get phone service. Now with multiple suppliers, we can shut off their service, but they can go someplace else to get service,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Miller said Wednesday.   The extra $200 million was the main reason AT&amp;T fell short of consensus estimates for the fourth quarter, analysts said. AT&amp;T's operating net was $0.76 against $0.68 in the year-earlier period and adrift of the $0.79 First Call consensus. ""We think there are some behaviors that are beginning to emerge that we need to work on as an industry,"" Miller told Reuters in an interview. ""The majority of the problems we had in 1996 were in the business market, but we are also seeing increased uncollectibles in the consumer area,"" he said.   There were increases in business fraud, delinquency and bankruptcies during the period, AT&amp;T said. ""We studied this in the fourth quarter and concluded we need to step up our ongoing provisioning. As we take on receivables, we allocate a certain proportion to bad debts or uncollectibles,"" he said. ""Half the $200 million was catch-up for (underprovisioning in) the past and the other represented what we were incurring in the fourth quarter,"" Miller said.   In 1996, AT&amp;T had $9 billion of account receivables plus $7.1 billion of financial receivables. Of these it put a total $1.3 billion into allowances including uncollectibles. Miller said the $100 million extra in the fourth quarter should be seen in the context of this overall figure. Worldnet, AT&amp;T's Internet access service launched in 1996, ended the year with 568,000 subscribers, but added fewer in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. ""Were close to being on our plan on online services...in a brand new industry that is very dynamic that is quite remarkable,"" he said.   He would make no predictions for when it might break even.

"The fragile health of China's 92-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping on Wednesday stirred intense speculation among Japanese and Hong Kong newspapers after the country's leaders cut short out-of-town trips. Deng was critically ill after suffering a brain haemorrhage, the Japanese daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said, quoting sources in the Chinese capital. ""According to diplomatic sources in Beijing, the health of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who has implemented policies of reform..., worsened and he was in a critical condition on February 18,"" the newspaper said. Chinese sources said on Monday that Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng had both cut short out-of-town trips last weekend to return to Beijing to visit Deng. The newspaper said sources close to senior officials in the People's Liberation Army said that Deng had ""recently suffered a brain haemorrhage"". The Chinese leadership had told senior party and government officials not to leave the country unless obliged to do so for pressing diplomatic reasons, it said. Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper said Deng was recuperating at home with a team of doctors attending to him. Deng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded central Beijing compound close to the Forbidden City, home for centuries to China's emperors. On Tuesday, China had played down fears that Deng's health was deteriorating. ""There has been no big change in comrade Deng Xiaoping's health,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang told a news briefing. He declined to say if there had been a small change or what could count as a major change in the health of the ailing patriarch. Rumours about Deng's health surface periodically and often have a direct impact on China-related bourses, where Deng's demise is seen by some as a potentially destabilising factor. Worries over Deng's health helped to push shares on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges sharply lower by their close on Tuesday and also rocked share prices in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The markets recovered slightly on Wednesday, but traders remained cautious about Deng's health. In an apparent bid to calm the markets, major Chinese newspapers prominently featured economic tsar Zhu Rongji attending a seminar on the economic theories of Deng, architect of China's sweeping economic reforms. The Chinese Securities newspaper, read by most traders in the market, announced the seminar in a front-page box to draw attention to the fact that Deng was still alive. Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival, when he appeared frail and faltering. He is thought to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity. Taiwan's United Daily News on Tuesday quoted the island's top official on mainland affairs, Chang King-yuh, as saying Deng's condition was serious. Officials said they were closely monitoring his health. ","JaneMacartney"
"Boehringer Mannheim Corp, a unit of privately held Corange Ltd, said data released Monday at an American College of Cardiology conference leveled the playing field between Boehringer and Genentech Inc in the market for clot-busting drugs to treat acute heart attack. ""What this study showed was comparability between the two products.... Essentially, at this point it will be a marketing fight,"" said Gregory Fulton, director of marketing for Boehringer's pharmaceuticals unit.   Results from the GUSTO III study showed that Boehringer's Retavase did not save more lives than Genentech's Activase, better known as TPA, researchers reported. In the trial, 10,139 patients received Retavase, while 4,921 patients received TPA. Both drugs, as well as another called streptokinase, are commonly administered within six hours after a heart attack. ""Retavase...did not provide statistically significant benefit in 30-day mortality as compared to (TPA),"" Genentech said in a statement released in conjunction with reporting of the data.   As a result, Genentech said, Retavase failed to score the win which Boehringer had hoped for from the study -- proof that the drug is better than TPA, long the dominant drug in the field. ""We do not dispute that. The results were very clear,"" said Boehringer's Fulton. At the same time, he said, GUSTO III showed the two drugs to be roughly comparable and Boehringer is ""very happy with that."" The researchers reported that the study's 30-day mortality rate was 7.43 percent for Retavase, versus 7.22 percent for TPA; total intracranial bleeding rate for Retavase was 0.91 percent and 0.88 percent for TPA; and total stroke rate for Retavase was 1.67 percent and 1.83 percent for TPA. ""GUSTO III reinforces the role (TPA) plays in savings lives every day,"" Genentech vice president of clinical research Dr. David Stump said in a statement. ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"Mercury Finance Co.'s woes deepened Friday when the company said it would be unable to pay $17 million in commercial debt due the same day and its stock lost 86 percent of its value. The auto lender's stock tumbled $12.75 to close at $2.125 on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of more than 42 million shares after it opened for trading for the first time since Tuesday. It fell as low as $1.625. Based on the more than 172 million shares outstanding as of early November, that would mean a loss of more than $2.2 billion in market capitalisaiton for the company. On Wednesday, the company said it found problems in its bookkeeping that caused it to overstate earnings by $90 million over four years. The consumer finance and auto loan company said Friday that as a result of downgrades from several debt rating services, it would not be able to issue new short-term debt, known as commercial paper, to repay maturing debt and could not make the payments due Friday. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Fitch Investors Service downgraded the company's commercial paper to a default rating. Lake Forest, Ill.-based Mercury said it was in discussions with lenders to satisfy its working capital needs, but could not predict the outcome of the discussions. Analysts said the company has another $100 million in commercial debt due next Thursday and that the company could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors if those discussions were unsuccessful. ""They're very close to some reorganization, bankruptcy filing, probably a voluntary reorganization,"" said Thomas Kmiotek, analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co. A finance company like Mercury makes money on the difference, or spread, between what it pays to borrow and the higher rates it charges customers. A finance company without a source of funds is like a retailer without a source of merchandise, analysts noted. ""If you can't fund, you're out of business,"" one analyst who follows the company said, requesting anonymity. A company spokesman did not return repeated phone calls seaking comment on Mercury's financing. The company said in a statement that it had retained Salomon Brothers Inc. to advise it on current and future capital needs and related issues. Mercury said on Wednesday it had to restate its earnings downward by about $90 million for the past four years because of accounting irregularities. It said the problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its controller, James Doyle. But Doyle's lawyer reportedly accused Mercury of a charade and said Doyle was cooperating with federal authorities. A special committee of Mercury's board, formed to investigate the accounting problems, has instructed its lawyers to contact Doyle's attorney for information on the investigation, Mercury said Friday. Doyle's lawyer was out of town Friday and did not return phone calls. The company said it also directed its lawyers and accounting firm to complete a thorough investigation of the company's auditing and accounting practices and report to the board. Another class-action lawsuit accusing the company of violating securities laws by issuing misleading and false financial statements was filed in federal court in Chicago, bringing to at least four the number of such suits filed.

"Conrail Inc. said Tuesday it planned to proceed with a crucial shareholder meeting Friday despite Norfolk Southern Corp.'s latest effort to thwart the railroad's planned $9.2 billion merger with CSX Corp. CSX Chairman John Snow described Norfolk Southern's effort as a ""desperate act"" that may be confusing shareholders. ""They had suffered two stinging defeats. They were probably reeling and felt the need to do something,"" Snow said in a telephone interview. He was referring to setbacks last week in which a federal judge and a regulatory agency denied Norfolk Southern's attempt to block the Conrail-CSX transaction. Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, whose $10.3 billion bid for Conrail has been rejected, said late Monday it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail stock if the Philadelphia-based railroad's shareholders defeated a key measure that would allow the proposed Conrail-CSX transaction to proceed. Wall Street sources had speculated the new development in the three-month takeover battle could prompt Conrail to delay the shareholder meeting. Conrail will be asking shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law that would essentially require Richmond, Va.-based CSX to pay for Conrail in cash. The proposed Conrail-CSX transaction is a mixture of cash and stock. Norfolk Southern has offered to buy Conrail for cash. Snow said he was ""reasonably confident, but guarded"" Conrail shareholders would approve the measure Friday. Votes are expected to be tallied by early next week. Wall Street analysts said Norfolk Southern might win some new allies with its plans, but said its efforts to derail the merger may not succeed. ""It might have some influence on (the shareholders), but it looks to me like it may be too late. This has been a tough battle for Norfolk Southern,"" said Thom Brown, managing director of investment firm Rutherford, Brown and Catherwood Inc., adding that Norfolk Southern was ""trying to win over any uncommitted shareholder they can find."" If shareholders defeat the measure, Conrail has the right to call another meeting. ""If we lose it, I think it's going to be 'shame on us' for not having communicated fully the benefits of this merger,"" Snow said. ""What I propose doing, if we lost it ... would be to take our time, and patiently go around and talk to the shareholders -- that may take three months, that may take six months -- until they really understood the merger."" Snow said he spoke earlier Tuesday to Conrail Chairman David LeVan. ""They're firmly committed to us. We're firmly committed to them,"" Snow said. ""We certainly hope we win the vote. If we don't win the vote, we're still committed to each other. We have a contract that's binding for two years."" Under the proposed deal, Conrail and CSX are prohibited from entering another merger until 1999. Separately, a U.S. appellate court scheduled arguments for Wednesday afternoon on a Norfolk Southern request to block the shareholders meeting. ","RobinSidel"
"Hewlett-Packard Co. Monday will raise the stakes in the fiercely-competitive and fast growing market for computer servers by launching new models that are more than double the speed of their predecessors. The new HP 9000 line of servers, the machines at the heart of computer networks including the Internet, are based on H-P's latest PA-RISC 8000 microprocessor. The company claims that they easily outperform those of its rivals. The widely-watch launch will put pressure on archrivals Sun Microsystems as well as competitors like International Business Machines Corp., Silicon Graphics Inc., and Digital Equipment Corp. The introduction, which follows a sluggish transition to speedy PA-8000-based workstations in June, will give a boost to Hewlett-Packard at a time of ferocious growth in the market. ""It's growing in the 50-plus range a year,"" Carol Mills, worldwide general manager for HP's multibillion dollar Unix server business, said in an interview. ""The Internet is hot,"" she said, but added that new applications such as data warehousing -- enabling access to vast data storage facilities -- and using servers as an alternatives to mainframes are also key market opportunities. Mills, who said the current shift to Internet-based technology presents ""not just a window of opportunity but the sliding glass door,"" estimates that the new markets alone will generate many billions of computer hardware revenue dollars. HP's three new server lines complete its transition to 64-bit microprocessors for Unix machines, and the company is due to deliver a 64-bit HP-UX Unix operating system next year. At the core of its new offering are four models its mid-range K-Class family, available immediately and ranging in starting price from $52,200 to $77,200. H-P said the HP 9000 K-Class models -- described as the ""sweet spot"" in its lineup -- are designed for symmetric multiprocessing and can accomodate one to four PA-8000 chips. The company said the highest performing K460 model had 85 percent better performance that Sun's Ultra Enterprise 3000, while outperforming Digital's 4100 5/400 by 65 percent and had twice the performance of IBM's RS/6000 J40. H-P also said a new high-end HP 9000 server, the T-Class Model T600 with symetrical multiprocessing as a mainframe alternative for such tasks as on-line transaction processing, will be available in the second calendar quarter of 1997. HP said it will also begin shipping two new models in its entry-level HP-9000 D-class in October. The D270, starting at $22,260 and the D370, priced at $25,250, are designed for worgroups and departments and for sale by resellers. As a sign of the fierce pace of product advances in the market, analysts noted the new models more than double the performance of machines updated as recently as February 1996 for the K-Class and January of this yer for the C-Class. Jean Bozman, an analyst at International Data Corp. said the updated HP 9000 models is ""a strong offering"" which would be a boost for existing customers and make it ""highly competitive"" with fast-charging Sun in the duel for number one. IDC's 1995 statistics show Hewlett-Packard had the lead in worldwide revenues from small- and medium-size servers at $3.4 billion, with Sun selling more than $1.8 billion worth. Across all Unix systems, according to IDC, H-P had server and workstation revenues totalling $6.1 billion, compared with $5.6 billion for Sun Microsystems, which due to lower system cost had the overall lead on a unit shipment basis. The approaching H-P launch prompted a preemptive strike from officials at Sun Microsystems, which closed its fiscal year-ending June quarter with record-level backlogs due to soaring orders for the Ultra machines it introduced in April. ""This is just a chip upgrade for a system they've had a long time,"" Anil Gadre, vice president of corporate marketing at Sun Microsystems, said of H-P's launch, dismissing the high performance ratings of what he termed ""a late life kicker."" ""We could not be in a better position to compete with them and position ourselves to take share away from them,"" he said. ","SamuelPerry"
"ITT Corp will have a difficult time convincing investors that a sale of its non-core assets would be more valuable than a $6.5 billion hostile bid from rival Hilton Hotels Corp, Wall Street analysts said. Although ITT would certainly be a better-focused company without assets like Madison Square Garden and world telephone directories, the move may come too late for shareholders who have seen the stock price erode in recent months. ""It begs the question:  Why didn't they do it sooner?"" said Daniel Davila of Rodman &amp; Redshaw Inc.   As expected, ITT earlier rejected Hilton's $6.5 billion takeover offer as inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders.  The hotel, casino and entertainment giant will review options to increase shareholder value, including the potential sale of non-core assets. Industry experts have estimated those assets could generate more than $2 billion that ITT could use to buy back stock or issue a special dividend to shareholders. Meanwhile, Hilton is widely expected to raise its $55 per share offer for ITT, perhaps as much as another $10 per share.   ""If Hilton comes back with $65, I think ITT will have trouble making a strong case to its shareholders,"" said Bruce Raabe of Collins &amp; Co. Shares of ITT jumped 1-3/4 to 57-3/4 in afternoon trading on views of a higher bid. Analysts also said that stockholders will not want to wait for ITT to sell holdings while a Hilton offer is on the table. Analysts and sources close to ITT have indicated the company would move quickly if it decides to sell assets and the stakes in Madison Square Garden and Alcatel Alsthom would be among the first to be sold.   French telecommunications company Alcatel said it has been approached by ITT for permission to sell some of its five percent stake before an agreed-upon July deadline. ITT signed a shareholders agreement with Alcatel in 1992 that called for it to retain the stake until July 3. And Cablevision, which owns the Madison Square Garden properties with ITT, reiterated that it has an excellent relationship with ITT and its chairman Rand Araskog. Cablevision declined to comment on speculation that it would buy ITT's 50 percent of Madison Square Garden. It has rights of first refusal if ITT decides to sell the stake.   Although the strategy may be a tough sell with shareholders, some industry experts noted that ITT's rejection was aggressive, well-planned and issued before Friday's response deadline. ""ITT has put the burden back on Hilton,"" said Bjorn Hanson of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, adding that ITT may still pursue an acquisition to stave off Hilton. Meanwhile, Hilton had little reaction to ITT's rejection, saying only that the response does not change its plans or its intent. ","RobinSidel"
"Ivory Coast's mid-crop cocoa harvest is set to exceed 100,000 tonnes, and rains may boost production to 160,000 or more, crop analysts said on Friday. ""It is possible but not definite,"" said one analyst after touring plantations. ""There is maybe two-thirds of that (160,000 tonnes) on trees at the moment but (the total) depends on what happens in the next three weeks."" Weather and other factors are highly variable at this time of year. National weather centre forecasters expect rains to strengthen in the next two to three weeks -- favouring pod development. ""There are less (pods) than last year but no worse than the average over the past four to five years,"" said the analyst. Ivory Coast set a record 1.2 million tonne total crop in 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) after a bumper 200,000 tonne mid-crop from end-April. Crop analysts disagreed over mid-crop data -- let alone five-year averages. Tonnages arriving at ports are often 30-60,000 tonnes down on harvests as farmers and buyers build stocks hoping for a price rise as new seasons open in October. ""People's statistics and carryover estimates differ, but mine show a tree crop of 175-180,000 over the past five years,"" said one analyst, adding that some private mid-crop forecasts were issued after taking off an estimated carryover figure. Main crop arrivals by March 7 totalled at least 920,000 tonnes, closing in on last year's one million. ""If the rains come in the next couple of weeks pod setting, leaf flushing and canopy regeneration will be good for the end of the mid-crop and the early main crop (1997/98),"" said the analyst. The rate of arrivals this week had slowed to a trickle with bean sizes slipping below export standard (105 per 100 grams, with eight percent or less humidity) in some areas. ""Main crop cocoa is fading out...There is still some at farmer level in some areas, mainly the southwest,"" said one exporter. Volumes are expected to pick up, particularly in June and July, after a gradual rise in May. ""If the main crops are becoming larger there is no reason to suppose the mid-crop will remain static,"" said one analyst. Fears that mid-crop cocoa would be ravaged by drought had partly eased. A drought in February was broken by light rains and thunder showers around the end of the month. ""I do not think the trees are in terrible condition and there are a reasonable number of pods on them,"" an analyst said. Recent rains have been heavy in some areas, with trees reported falling around Soubre in the west. Overall levels remain down compared with last year, but crop analysts said trees were bearing up well despite localised damage. Plantations in eastern areas bordering Ghana had suffered most, with some destroyed by bush fires in February. ""That is not a great problem as most of the trees are old,"" said one analyst. -- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"The French government is moving edgily towards a key decision for the future of Europe's defence industry -- whether to privatise defence electronics group Thomson-CSF through a public sale or private placement. The stakes are huge, as the choice of the method of sale will to a large extent determine the final outcome of a far-reaching restructuring in the French defence industry and has major implications for the entire sector in Europe. Like a master chess player, the state must look several moves ahead, decide what sort of defence industry it wants to see in a few years' time, and ensure the decision will be seen as fair to all involved. Government sources said on Friday that the decision, originally expected at the end of January, would probably slip into early February because the government was studying in great detail all the elements of the politically-sensitive dossier that involves Europe's biggest defence electronics company. ""The decision will be taken shortly, but not today. We are still studying all possibilities,"" said an official source. ""The decision will have to be taken by the cabinet. At the moment there is no proposal to send to the ministers. I could not tell you when exactly that will happen,"" he added. Prime Minister Alain Juppe is anxious to avoid another embarassment like the one he suffered on December 4 when the government had to suspend an earlier privatisation plan under which Thomson-CSF would have gone to conglomerate French Lagardere Groupe. That deal involved the privatisation of the Thomson group, which included both a 68 percent stake in Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM). The state was forced to call off the plan because the independent privatisation commission balked at the terms of a sale of TMM to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics. The cancellation outraged the Korean, who called the decision racist and prompted an angry call for explanation from President Kim Young-sam. Since then the French government has decided to separate the sales of TMM and Thomson-CSF. The ultimate aim of the government is to have a strong defence industry able to supply its armed forces with state-of-the art weaponry and play a leading role in Europe and on the world scene. A year ago, President Jacques Chirac announced a wide-ranging restructuring of the French defence industry around a merged group of Aerospatialeand Dassault Aviation for aerospace, and Thomson-CSF for electronics. With a public sale through a market float, Thomson-CSF management will have its hands free to pursue its own negotiations about future alliances while interested partners can acquire stakes on the market. But this may mean that a foreign cash-rich group from elsewhere in Europe or from the U.S. or Asia could buy itself into the talks. With a private placement there are two main options. One is by choosing candidates for a sale using a ""cahier de charges"" -- a sort of bidding book comprising price, intended strategy and commitments on jobs and investments. This would leave the government with the biggest influence on the outcome, but also with the biggest responsibilty. Another procedure, rare in France, would be to auction the state's 68-percent stake in Thomson-CSF among qualified bidders, putting the emphasis on price and ensuring the greatest possible revenues for the state at a time France is trying to reduce its public deficits ahead of monetary union.

"Cigarette companies will face one of their biggest legal challenges in four decades Monday when the first ever class-action anti-smoking case goes to trial in a Florida court. ""This is the first of the big ones,"" Richard Daynard, an anti-smoking activist who heads the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University in Boston, said of the case, known as Broin vs. Philip Morris Co., et al. In addition to being the first class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry, the case is also being watched very closely because the plaintiffs -- 60,000 airline flight attendants -- are not themselves smokers. That fact will prevent the cigarette companies from using one of their traditional defences -- that smokers are aware of the possible health risks of smoking and voluntarily chose to smoke. The $5 billion Broin case was brought by airline flight attendants who claim their lung cancer and other tobacco-related illnesses were caused by passengers' cigarette smoke. Smoking was banned on U.S. airliners in 1988. ""One of the most successful defences for tobacco companies is that the smokers knew of the risks,"" said Professor Michael Zimmer of the Seton Hall School of Law in New Jersey. ""In secondhand smoke, you don't have that."" Lawyers said the ranks of tobacco attorneys representing the 10 companies named in the lawsuit will challenge and probe the testimony of experts called by Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, the Miami husband-and-wife attorney team pressing the Broin lawsuit. The case is named for Norma Broin, 42 and suffering lung cancer. Among the witnesses for the flight attendants will be two former U.S. surgeon generals and physicians and scientists drawing on a decade or more of research on secondhand smoke, Stanley Rosenblatt said. A Harvard University study published last week which found a strong link between heart disease and secondhand smoke is a boon for the flight attendants, Rosenblatt and other attorneys said. A lawyer for Philip Morris declined to discuss the details of the case, other than to say the tobacco companies expected to prevail. Zimmer said the Rosenblatt's case may be weakened by the two-stage trial structure, since little of the individual suffering and pain will be telegraphed to the jurors as the attorneys battle over statistics and scientific methodology. ""In class-action suits, juries want a human element and the plaintiffs won't have that,"" Zimmer said. ""A loss in Broin would make the companies ever more desperate,"" said Daynard, a pioneer in promoting lawsuits against cigarette companies. Other multibillion-dollar lawsuits by the states of Mississippi, Florida and Texas, and another class-action lawsuit in Miami, are scheduled for trial in coming months. All are part of a four-decade legal assault which may be costing the industry as much as $600 million a year to counter. A loss in the Broin case might also unleash another wave of class-action and other individual lawsuits against U.S. cigarette makers, which already face an estimated 1,000 current claims in the United States, lawyers said. The Broin case, which wound through Florida courts for six years, comes to trial just as state governments and cigarette companies are negotiating a deal likely to block many types of anti-tobacco suits and settle the 29 lawsuits brought by state attorneys general. The landmark talks may also yield industry acceptance of stiff U.S. marketing and sales regulations and creation of a $300 billion pool to pay for the medical care of sick smokers. ","MichaelConnor"
"The French government on Wednesday called off a controversial sale of the state electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe but President Jacques Chirac vowed to bring the sell-off to fruition. The government, which had doggedly defended its choice amid a storm of employee protest and political opposition, made the U-turn after the independent Privatisation Commission challenged the terms of a South Korean firm's involvement in the sale. ""The French defence electronics industry can lay claim to being world class,"" Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said. ""The privatisation of Thomson is key to creating the necessary 'poles of excellence' needed to achieve this ambition."" ""The government will carry (the sale) out in accordance with the terms set on February 22,"" she said, referring to Chirac's televised speech on restructuring the army and defence industry. Finance Minister Jean Arthuis told reporters the process would be delayed by several weeks, but other politicians said it could stall things for months. ""Unfortunately, the decision to suspend the privatisation process to which the government has had to resort will delay this process by serveral months, possibly even a year,"" said, Francois-Michel Gonnot, a parliamentary committee chairman and member of the ruling coalition. Lagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58-percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its Matra Defense Espace unit and sell television set and video recorder maker Thomson Multimedia to Korea's Daewoo Electronics. The Privatisation Commission, France's highest authority on the sale of state assets, said in a confidential report obtained by Reuters that the Daewoo deal did not fully reflect the value of Thomson's technology in digital decoders and flat screens. The decision to suspend the sale of loss-making Thomson SA was the second embarassing U-turn on a privatisation in two weeks after a decision to suspend the sale of state-owned bank CIC following staff protests and political opposition. Several thousand workers of Thomson Multimedia marched in Paris and other cities on November 20 to protest against a sale to a booming Asian competitor, fearing for their jobs and working conditions. The government said in mid-October it had picked Lagardere over rival bidder Alcatel Alsthom because it was best for French defence interests and that it would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc after a 10.8 billion franc ($2 billion) state capital injection. Lagardere shares closed 6.4 percent down at 146.00 francs in Paris after having been suspended in the morning, because investors believed the Thomson deal was good for the company. Alcatel Alsthom dropped three percent to 460.70 francs because it is now back in the race. Opposition parties said on Wednesday that they hoped the delay would lead to the total scrapping of the sale plan. ""Today is a first success...but we should not stop there,"" Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande said. ""We are now calling for the privatisation to be abandoned totally,"" he said. Communist Party members said they now wanted a national debate on the future of Thomson. The ruling RPR party said in a statement Hollande was behaving like a ""shipwrecked man who blames his rescuers for his problems in getting afloat."" ","MarcelMichelson"
"France Telecom said on Monday it had taken full control of Keystone Communications, a major U.S. television uplink company, to strengthen its position in the North American television market. Michel Combes, director general of France Telecom's audiovisual transmisson activities, said the acquisition for less than $100 million gave the company a prestigious client list of the U.S. majors as well as an enhanced position in Asia. ""The acquisition boosts our position on the North American market where our main rival is VIVX Global Access,"" Combes said by telephone from Cannes where he is attending the MIDEM audiovisual market fair. France Telecom, through its Telediffusion De France (TDF) unit, is already leader in the European market with a 20 percent stake, ahead of British Telecommunications Plc and has an estimated 15 percent in the world market. Keystone has a 20 percent share of the North American market. The market for audiovisual transmission -- the service of carrying television pictures from an event or studio to the broadcasting centre -- is estimated at eight billion francs ($1.5 billion) and seen growing by eight percent per year. The market of broadcasting pictures to the homes, both direct to home as well as to cable company receivers, is also seen at some eight billion francs. Total sales of the unit are two billion francs. This market stands to grow rapidly with the take-off of digital satellite television companies. France Telecom is partner and service provider to the Television Par Satellite (TPS) digital satellite television venture with TF1, France Television, Lyonnaise des Eaux and Luxembourg's Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Television (CLT). Combes said that while the world market was seen growing by eight percent, this growth was less pronounced in Europe while Asia would increase at a quicker pace. TDF has a pact with Japan's KDD as well as NHK and is service provider to Hong Kong's television company. He said France Telecom wanted ""to have a foothold in Asia"" which he called an ""interesting market with good growth potential"" but he declined to comment on whether to company would make an acquisition soon in the area. ""It is increasingly important that you can provide services for your television clients from whatever place in the world, be it for news or sport,"" Combes said. France Telecom already had a 40 percent stake in Keystone and bought the remainder from Simmons Group. Together with its Maxat British unit, the three companies are now offering international services under the name ""Global Skylink"".

"The United States appears to be getting sucked ever deeper into Colombia's drug war, where the lines between counternarcotics and counterinsurgency are increasingly blurred, political analysts say. U.S. officials, who will announce this week whether to ""certify"" Colombia as a trustworthy ally in the anti-drug fight, are publicly critical of its failure to crack down hard enough on the twin scourges of cocaine and heroin. But Western diplomats and analysts say it is not Colombians but a ""massive"" contingent of U.S. advisers, both military and civilian, who have dictated counternarcotics strategy behind the scenes since the early 1970s. Those advisers have long known they were battling an elusive enemy of peasant farmers who tend illicit plantations, money-laundering bankers and corrupt politicians as well as the drug kingpins themselves. Now for the first time Washington appears to be taking seriously claims by Colombian authorities that leftist guerrillas have become major drug traffickers. The guerrillas deny the allegation and say it is being used as a pretext for increasingly direct U.S. intervention on Colombian soil. ""We must recognise the decisive role played by some elements of Colombia's insurgent guerrilla groups,"" Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard told the U.S. Congress on Feb. 14. ""Those groups constitute a real threat to Colombian anti-drug forces deployed to eradicate (drug) fields and the American personnel who support them."" Allegations of rebel ties to the drug trade date back to the late 1980s, when then U.S. envoy Lewis Tambs coined the phrase ""narco-guerrillas."" It may be no coincidence that U.S. officials are reviving the issue at a time when the Colombian military faces growing criticism over its human rights record. In an annual report, U.S. President Bill Clinton will announce this week whether Colombia should remain on a list of countries subject to possible economic sanctions because of their perceived failure to fight drugs hard enough. If Colombia is decertified again diplomats say the move will be directed more at President Ernesto Samper and his allegedly drug-financed election than at Colombia's police and military -- the natural U.S. allies on the frontlines of the drug war. And with or without certification, American counternarcotics aid will not be affected, U.S. officials say. Gelbard's department has already doubled anti-drug funding for Colombia to $44 million for 1997 and another $37.5 million has been allocated from a separate discretionary fund. In addition Washington has pledged a multimillion-dollar package of material aid including upgraded cropduster aircraft and 24 UH-1 helicopters to spearhead the next phase of the drug war. Some experts compare the situation in Colombia to Vietnam in the 1960s when the United States became progressively bogged down in a faraway conflict as it shifted from covert involvement to frontline operations. ""To insert the U.S. into this kind of complex conflict is like putting the U.S. into Vietnam. If the U.S. provides aid for the drug war then it is essentially for counterinsurgency purposes too,"" Florida-based analyst Eduardo Gamarra said. U.S. officials refuse to say how many advisers and agents are now working in Colombia and are coy about revealing the exact nature of their involvement. But a Western diplomat said 44 U.S. military were stationed at one of three ground-based radar stations manned by U.S. personnel carrying out ""essentially frontline intelligence gathering and monitoring."" It is also known that U.S. spy-in-the-sky satellites chart the spread of illicit coca leaf or opium poppy plantations and that shadowy U.S. reconnaissance planes buzz suspicious light aircraft in Colombian airspace. Just last month the first U.S. pilot died in action when his plane crashed during a crop eradication mission over guerrilla-infested jungles. Bogota-based political analyst Juan Tokatlian believes the prospects of successful U.S. intervention in the drug war are bleak. ""The idea of Vietnam creates the idea of a single territory and a single combat. This is much more complex since the drug war is being waged throughout the region. It could be much more dramatic in its effects in the long term than Vietnam,"" he said. ","KarlPenhaul"
"French chemical group Rhone-Poulenc SA and Merck &amp; Co Inc of the U.S. announced on Thursday they were merging their animal health activities to create the world leader in the sector. The new 50/50 joint venture company Merial, with estimated 1996 sales of $1.750 billion, will be the market leader in biology products, veterinary drugs and poultry drugs, they said. In the animal health sector Merial will overtake Pfizer-Smithkline Beecham, Bayer and Novartis -- the recent merger between Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG of Switzerland. Igor Landau, managing director of Rhone-Poulenc, told a news conference the merger would cut costs and have an effect on jobs, although it was too early to give details. ""It will not be in France that the impact will be most pronounced,"" he said, adding that the merger would have a positive effect on Rhone's results. Merck will make an unspecified payment to Rhone for the 50/50 parity. ""Taking everything into account, the valuation of our business was higher than that of Merck,"" Landou said, because Rhone's growth potential was higher. The joint-venture will merge the animal health activities of Rhone Merieux and Merck AgVet. It will be headed in the first few years by Merck's John Preston, while Rhone's Louis Champel will become chief executive of Merial and will succeed Preston. Landau said discussions had lasted several months and a letter of intent had been signed on Thursday morning. J.P. Morgan and Bear Sterns were advisor banks. Merck was the number two in animal health in 1995 but has been overtaken in 1996 by Novartis. Its leading product, Ivermectine, loses some of its patent protection next year but has still some eight years of sales ahead of it. 1996 sales for this product alone have been some $750 million. Rhone Merieux's main product is the recently launched Frontline, which has had sales this year of $85 million and expects them to doublein 1997. Merial will benefit from the launch of a number of new Merck products in the coming years while a new jointly-developed product will be ready in three years. ""The real creation of added value is in innovation,"" Landau said, stressing the possible synergies of the joint research and development. Shares in Rhone-Poulenc were up 0.48 percent at 166.80 francs on the Paris stock exchange at 1200 GMT. Landau said that Merial would not be listed seperately. He said that Rhone's animal health activities had a profitabilty of 13.5 percent in operating income as a percentage of sales and of some 18 percent in operating income as a percentage of working capital. Merck's profitability is ""largely higher"" than that. The Merial merger is the latest of a series of big corporate moves in animal health. In 1994, American Cyanamid was bought by American Home Products Corp (AHP). In 1995 by Pfizer bought the animal health business of Smithkline Beecham Plc and Rhone Merieux acquired the veterinary business of Sanofi, part of Elf Aquitaine. 1996 saw the creation of Novartis and Belgium's Solvay sold its animal health business to AHP. Landau said that Mallinckrodt, number nine in world animal health, was for sale but Rhone was not interested. Asked to comment on rumours of a merger between Rhone's Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Sanofi, following a Thursday statement by Elf that a merger was desirable for Sanofi, Landau said Rhone was not interested in a pharmaceutical alliance.

"Brokers Were Stockbroking and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett had placed all of The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd's 616.6 million Foster's Brewing Group Ltd shares with institutions and private clients by early on Friday, Were said. Retail investors bought about A$150 million of the A$1.535 billion package of shares, with about 55 percent of the remainder being sold to overseas institutional investors and about 45 percent sold to local institutions, Were Stockbroking managing director John Paterson said.   Paterson pointed to a A$2.5 billion-equivalent placement of three percent of The British Petroleum Co Plc shares in May as possibly the largest such placement this year. The Kuwait Investment Office sold three percent or 170 million of BP's shares through Goldman Sachs in mid-May this year for about 7.0 stg per share. Paterson said the two brokers began placing the stock at about 3.30 p.m. (0530 GMT) on Thursday after Foster's announced the buy-back of 13.0 percent of its capital from Asahi Breweries Ltd and BHP's placement of 616.6 million Foster's shares. The buy-back and placement were at A$2.49 per share.   Were and ABN AMRO's Australian offices worked until very late on Thursday night before handing it over to their New York and European offices. Paterson said the buy-back was completed at about 9.00 a.m. (2330 GMT). ""We had strong institutional support in Australia, similarly in London and Europe, particularly London, and in the United States,"" Paterson said. Private client support from Were's New Zealand and Australian clients was also strong, he said.   ""The other satisfying fact is you tend to assume after one of these deals that you've exhausted the demand in the market place, but with the stock trading up at A$2.55 against the placement price of A$2.49, it says there's still quite a lot of untapped demand out there,"" he said. Foster's shares were down five cents at A$2.55 at 1.40 p.m. (0340 GMT) on 675 million shares put through the market. Foster's said on Thursday it expected foreign investors to hold about a third of its shares after the reconstruction.   Foster's said BHP had agreed to limit individual investors to parcels of no more than five percent of BHP's Foster's shares. Paterson said the successful completion of the deal was satisfying for Were and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett and they were now looking forward to a rest.

"Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc is launching 28 new corn hybrids this year, which it hopes will help reverse over the next few years a recent drop in its leading seed corn market share. ""We feel very good about the 28 new hybrids that we're introducing in 1997,"" Richard ""Rick"" McConnell, senior vice president and director of research, said in a telephone interview. ""We think we're going to be able to position those well in 1997 for customers to get a good look at, and will be able to build volume up very quickly for '98 and '99...""   Of the 28 new corn hybrids that Pioneer is introducing, eight have the Bt gene to fight off the European corn borer, a serious insect pest, McConnell said. These Bt corn varieties are part of a host of genetically altered, or transgenic, corn hybrids that are being developed and launched by Pioneer and other agricultural companies. Although Pioneer's share of the North American seed corn market is four times that of its nearest competitor, the need to develop unique biotech crops has leveled the playing field, analysts noted.   ""It (biotechnology) has made the other players seem a lot bigger. They (Pioneer) did not move as quickly and as early on biotechnology,"" Piper Jaffray analyst George Dahlman said. ""They have done an amazing job of catching up."" In addition to Bt corn, Pioneer's other transgenic products include soybeans that can withstand the use of Monsanto Co's Roundup herbicide. Pioneer also will have limited quantities of corn that can resist Liberty herbicide, which is produced by AgrEvo, a venture between Hoechst AG and Schering AG.   Pioneer is developing corn that can resist Roundup, but it may be 1998 or 1999 until it is introduced, McConnell said. For this year, McConnell declined to project Pioneer's North American corn market share, which in fiscal 1996 dropped to 44 percent from 45 percent. DeKalb Genetics Corp, the number two player, has an 11 percent market share in corn. He linked the market share loss in 1996 in part to the fallout from disease and insect problems that hurt two Pioneer hybrids in 1995. Those problems are being addressed with new corn hybrids.   Piper Jaffray's Dahlman said he expects Pioneer's market share will be about flat in fiscal 1997 ending in August compared with 1996. To bolster its future product lineup, Pioneer would consider collaborating with other players, including some outside the agricultural industry, McConnell said. ""There will be other biotech boutiques that we will want to work with,"" he added. Pioneer currently collaborates with Mycogen Inc, an agricultural biotech company, and Human Genome Sciences Inc, which is involved in a DNA project with Pioneer. While Pioneer targets 20 percent return on equity and double-digit percentage growth in earnings per share, it will not shy away from investing in technology, McConnell said. ""We're not looking to shoot ourselves in the foot with short-term issues just to achieve those goals,"" McConnell said. ""We'll make the appropriate investments.""

"By selling its Snapple beverage business for $300 million, Quaker Oats Co on Thursday both disappointed and relieved Wall Street. The price was far lower than analysts following the company said they had hoped Quaker would be able to get. ""It was a fire-sale price.  I'd been using $600 to $700 million"" as an estimated value for Snapple, said Prudential Securities food industry analyst John McMillin. At the same time, analysts said they were relieved that Quaker was ending its disastrous Snapple venture.   ""The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back,"" said BT Securities food industry analyst John O'Neil. Shares in Quaker were up 3/8 to 37-7/8 in late morning on heavy volume, after trading as high as 39-1/2.  Shares in Triarc Cos Inc, which is buying the Snapple line from Quaker, were up one to 16-3/4 after trading as high as 18. Triarc owns the Mistic and Royal Crown beverage lines, as well as Arby's Inc fast-food restaurants and liquefied petroleum and specialty dyes and chemicals businesses.   Chicago-based Quaker bought Snapple for $1.8 billion, including acquisition costs, two-and-a-half years ago near the height of the alternative beverage brand's popularity. Since the purchase, widely seen by analysts as overvalued, Quaker has struggled with the line of ready-to-drink teas and juices.  Snapple sales declined eight percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, and the business ran at a cash loss, the company reported last month. ""The bad news is the (Snapple) investment's been a disaster; the good news is they're trying to put it behind them,"" McMillin said. Quaker's other products include Gatorade, which continues to dominate the sports drink market, and cereals, such as Quaker oatmeals, Cap'n Crunch and Life. ""Quaker still has the crown jewels -- Gatorade and the cereals -- and performance in those businesses has been pretty good,"" said PaineWebber food industry analyst George Staphos.

"British supermarket group Tesco Plc has put price back on top of the agenda with a new campaign and, although analysts played down fears of a price war on Thursday, loyalty cards could take a back seat to value for money. ""Loyalty is a factor but price is the most important factor,"" said analyst Richard Perks of Verdict Research. After markets had closed on Wednesday, Tesco said it would invest 30 million pounds ($47 million) in its ""Unbeatable Value"" campaign, promising to offer the lowest prices on 600 items in addition to regular monthly offers on 2,000 lines. It said customers who found the items cheaper at other stores would be refunded twice the difference and Tesco would lower its own prices immediately. Its shares, which had fallen earlier this week on worries of an aggressive campaign, rebounded on Thursday to be up seven pence to 298 by 1445 GMT. Arch-rival J. Sainsbury was down 3-1/2 at 373. ""These are budgeted cuts, not panic price-cutting, there's no reason to reduce forecasts,"" said one sector analyst who declined to be named. Sainsbury launched its own autumn campaign, targeting 700 items in a continuation of regular monthly moves, on September 1. A spokeswoman declined to comment on Tesco's move. ""A war has to have two sides. We are not fighting anyone. We are here for our customers,"" a Tesco spokesman said. Analysts questioned why the market leader would want to prompt a price war, particularly as there are glimmering signs that the economy might be improving. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on Thursday said retail sales volume was up again in August and the balance of firms reporting an increase in business was the largest since November 1988. In addition, latest market share figures for supermarkets from AGB research suggest Tesco turned in a creditable performance in August after seeing its slice of the cake dip marginally in July. ""I am not particularly concerned...you always get autumn promotional campaigns of some sort and (Tesco's) may be just a bit more aggressive than we have seen in the past,"" said Dave Stoddart, sector analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite. But BZW was reported to be concerned that Tesco's move could precipitate cuts elsewhere. Supermarkets are largely keen to avoid a full-blown price war which would shrink margins and eat into profits. The focus recently has been on loyalty cards to boost sales. The latest launch was the Reward card from Sainsbury, which capitulated in June after the success of Tesco's ClubCard had helped to tip it off the market leader slot last year. It now has six million subscribers and has generated a boost of around two to three percent in sales, deputy chief executive Dino Adriano said last week. ""Clearly we needed to launch a Reward card. It's become a way of doing business within this marketplace,"" Adriano said. Among the big four British supermarket groups, only ASDA has so far held back from launching a loyalty card. It is running trials in 18 stores and has not ruled it out. But the indications are that loyalty cards are largely just breaking even for supermarkets and providing a means of retaining customers rather than adding extra shoppers, analysts said. If Tesco, which leads the market and has 8.5 million subscribers to its ClubCard, feels the need to focus on price, other supermarkets may find it hard not to follow.

"A World Trade Organisation (WTO) without China is a global trade body with a missing limb, but the world's most populous nation still must meet basic criteria before gaining entry, a British minister said on Thursday. A robust approach could be taken to Beijing's application for WTO membership, Ian Lang, president of Britain's Board of Trade, told a news conference in the Chinese capital. ""A WTO without China would be a WTO with a limb missing,"" Lang said in an speech to Chinese and British businessmen that was released to reporters at the news conference. ""We very much support China's application to join the WTO. However, we also believe that China's accession must be on the right terms,"" Lang said. ""It has to be...on the same terms on which other countries have membership of the WTO,"" Lang told the news conference. ""It is important not to dilute the strength of the WTO."" Beijing has been seeking to join the global trade body with developing country status, but some Western nations maintain that China's economy is too big to warrant such treatment. ""I understand the anxieties that China has, it...still feels it has a considerable way to go in some areas,"" Lang said. ""There are certain fundamental elements to approaching membership of the WTO that can be approached fairly robustly,"" he said. He cited trade transparency, market access, tariffs and legal structures as areas that needed further exploration. A WTO working group will meet later this year in Geneva to try to negotiate a deal that would allow China's accession, but China said last month its prospects appeared bleak. Lang said China and Britain were expected to sign a memorandum of understanding next month that would let Chinese companies list on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Many cash-strapped Chinese companies are keen to apply for listing on overseas markets, but Chinese securities officials say agreement with the LSE has been long delayed by disputes between London and Beijing over Hong Kong. Some 20 Chinese companies are listed in Hong Kong while a handful are traded in New York. Lang said Sino-British ties were continuing to warm following high-level exchanges this year. Relations between Beijing and London have been tested in recent years by disputes over the mid-1997 return of Hong Kong, now a British colony, to Chinese rule. ","MureDickie"
"Canadian gold miner William Resources Inc said on Tuesday it expects to ""easily achieve"" its goal of over 200,000 ounces of gold in 1997 and it has the financial resources to ride out a weak gold market. In its outlook for 1997, the Toronto-based company said early tests of its Ballarat East project in Australia are promising, but its plans for Ruster's Roost are on hold. William also gave a favorable update of its operations in Scandinavia and Brazil, but said its disappointing Mexican project is up for sale. ""We had stated that in 1997 we would do over 200,00 ounces at a cash cost under US$300 an ounce. We feel that we are going to easily achieve that goal,"" Bharti told analysts during a conference call on Tuesday. Gold production in 1996 was an annualized 100,000 ounces of gold with an average cash cost of US$349 per ounce. William Resources made three acquisitions last year which pushed it into the ranks of intermediate gold producers. The Bjorkdal mine in Sweden, acquired in December 1996, is expected to exceed 100,000 ounces in 1997 at a cash cost of US$216 per ounce. In Brazil, the Jacobina project is forecast this year at 65,000 ounces of gold at a cash cost of US$285 per ounce. Bharti said the current downturn in gold prices and depressed stock prices due to the Bre-X Minerals Ltd controversy has undermined investor confidence. The Toronto Stock Exchange's gold index was off 233 points on Tuesday as COMEX gold futures sank over US$5 an ounce. ""We've got gold at US$345 (an ounce) this morning. Stocks with the Bre-X issue are really struggling. There's a huge malaise in the gold market where people are wondering if gold is a good investment,"" Bharti said. But William Resources is in good shape with 90 percent of its gold hedged at over US$374 per ounce, he said. Bharti added that cash flow from operations of US$25 million in 1997 gives the company the enough flexibility ""if this market gets any worse."" He said the company could also defer some capital spending. About US$15 million of William's US$20 million capital budget in 1997 is discretionary. Looking at individual projects, Bharti said bulk testing at the Ballarat East gold project in Australia should be completed by the end of this month. ""I can say the results to date...we're finding some very exciting nuggets in Ballarat that certainly we had not expected,"" Bharti said. The outlook was less favorable for Ruster's Roost where a feasibility study indicated the project would need gold prices of around US$400 an ounce to be viable. Bharti said plant construction would continue until July, but future spending would be deferred after that. ""We would really like to see in this present gold market what the price of gold is and how the overall market performs before we put the propellers on Ruster's Roost,"" he said. In Mexico, the Velardena project is up for sale following a disappointing performance last year. William Resources took a C$3.5 million writedown on the project in the three months ended December 31, 1996. ""We've been approached by two or three companies that are focused on Mexico and interested in buying Valedania and we are in advanced negotiaitons with these companies,"" he said. Earlier this week, the company said first quarter 1997 gold production exceeded 47,000 ounces at a cash cost of US$295 per ounce. The results were slightly under budget due to poor weather at Ruster's Roost in January, Bharti said. He said financial results for the first quarter will be released before the company's annual meeting on May 14. At the meeting, shareholders will vote on a proposed one for three stock consolidation.

"China lashed out on Friday at U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, saying some political prisoners the group defended were convicted rapists and swindlers, and accused it of adopting a Cold War mentality. The chapter on China in the World Report 1997 released by the human rights monitoring group last month ""contains malicious and slanderous attacks against China's human rights situation and is frivolous and unjust"", the official Xinhua news agency said. Beijing regularly retaliates against criticism of its human rights record, regarding it as interference in its internal affairs and saying its priority is to fulfil the right of its 1.2 billion people to food and clothing. ""The report terms those criminals who have been convicted of crimes such as hooliganism, swindling, bribery and embezzlement and endangering the state security as 'dissidents' and 'political prisoners',"" Xinhua said, quoting an official of the China Society for the Study of Human Rights. ""This cannot but make the readers suspicious of its true intentions,"" he said. In the past year, China has effectively silenced its tiny community of dissidents, jailing several for lengthy terms for crimes ranging from hooliganism to plotting to subvert the state and sentencing others to up to three years of re-education through labour. ""They are feeling under pressure as a result of groups such as ours on human rights,"" Robin Munro, who runs the Hong Kong office of Human Rights Watch/Asia, said by telephone. ""Rather than respond to the criticisms it is much easier to try to discredit and undermine the charges,"" he said. ""It is hard to take this kind of vituperative diatribe seriously."" The report contained the first official confirmation that Guo Haifeng, a leader of 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy, had been sentenced -- receiving a five-year jail term last November for the catch-all crime of hooliganism. ""He later raped six women, married or unmarried, in defiance of laws, by tempting them with the ways of talking about love affairs or buying houses, which constituted hooliganism,"" Xinhua said. Chinese courts frequently sentence people to jail for hooliganism in cases where sex outside marriage, rather than rape, may have occurred. Sex outside marriage is an offence in China, while rape is punishable by death. Guo had confessed to his crimes, Xinhua said, dismissing the Human Rights Watch report that Guo had been jailed for helping another dissident flee the country. Xinhua attacked Human Rights Watch for describing Xiao Biguang as a political prisoner when he had been ordered in 1994 to serve three years of re-education through labour for swindling. ""They know perfectly well that he was sentenced for his activities in the underground church in China and in labour relations,"" Munro said of Xiao. The Chinese human rights researcher accused Human Rights Watch of maintaining a Cold War mentality, of political bias against a socialist China and said it had become ""the most aggressive vanguard of the anti-China force"". ""If Human Rights Watch persists in acting as the instigator and troublemaker in creating conflicts over the issue of human rights, it will certainly become a hindrance and stumbling block in the development of the world human rights cause,"" he said.

"The looming national strike, due to start in Colombia at midnight on Monday, may unleash political and social unrest, political analysts believe, but few predict it will shake the ruling order. Government ministers have been at pains to reject any parallels with the reigning chaos in Ecuador which began with a general strike and ended in the ouster of President Abdala Bucaram. Union leaders said on Monday that the indefinite stoppage by an estimated 800,000 state workers, pressing for higher wages and end to a repressive labour code, could develop into a civic protest. But political commentators insist there is little threat to President Ernesto Samper, who has already battled through the thick of a political crisis fuelled by allegations that he funded his 1994 election campaign with drug money. They say Samper has retained much higher levels of support among the ruling classes and ordinary voters than Bucaram was able to do. In an editorial Sunday, the respected political magazine Semana wrote: ""Samper earned the condemnation of the political classes because of what happened in his campaign. But he has observed the needs of the country's other main power-brokers -- the economic elite, Congress, the Liberal Party, the military. His economic measures have never been as drastic nor as impopular as those of Bucaram."" In the latest opinion polls Samper's popularity rating among voters hovers around 40 percent. He did, however, make many enemies among the working classes, whom he tries to court with his populist discourse, when he decreed below-inflation hikes in public sector pay and in the minimum private sector wage at the start of this year. The tough line on pay prompted both country's main unions to pull out of a wage-price control agreement known as the social pact. The state workers are now pushing for a 21.5 percent pay increase and an end to the government's planned programme of national and regional privatisations -- a cornerstone of Samper's economic policy. ""This strike began for labour and wage reasons but it is beginning to take on a social aspect,"" said Eberto Lopez, head of the 8,300-strong Telecom workers' union. ""Depending on the extent to which other sectors of labour and society become involved this strike could take on a different character,"" he added. Last week, Samper charged that the strike was being used to promote covert political aims and not straightforward wage demands. The opposition Conservative Party and the Communist Party have said they will back the strike. The security forces, meanwhile, have warned that leftist guerrillas are looking to launch a wave of attacks across the country under cover of the protest. Labour leader Wilson Borja, head of the main public sector union FENALTRASE, tried to calm rising passions on Monday, insisting the strike was being driven solely by labour demands and that the state workers were not looking to topple Samper. Interior Minister Horacio Serpa, Samper's right-hand man, played down comparisons with Colombia's southern neighbour. ""This strike bears no relation to the actions of 20 years ago that left such a bad taste in Colombia's mouth. Nor is there any comparison with the situation that is occurring in other latitudes,"" he told reporters. The last major labour protest took place in September 1977, with the mass backing of private and public sector unions and social groups. At least 20 demonstrators were killed in a single day of running street battles in Bogota. ","KarlPenhaul"
"China and the United States began talks to hammer out their textile trade differences on Tuesday with both sides voicing optimism that agreement could be reached before a Friday deadline. Washington and Beijing had a productive first day of a scheduled three days of talks aimed at extending a bilateral textile accord and resolving a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, said top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes. ""Very productive morning,"" Hayes said, adding that much remained to be done. ""We still have lots of issues to resolve."" ""We are maintaining an optimistic attitude towards the prospects of these textile talks,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing. ""The resolution of this problem will be beneficial for both sides."" The 1994 Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 last year but was extended by one month to allow the two sides to seek compromise on the terms of its renewal. Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries that have prompted U.S. threats of multi-million dollar penalties and raised the spectre of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue. The Friday deadline for a renewed textile accord could not be pushed back once more -- but U.S. officials believed agreement would be reached in time, Hayes said before her talks at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. ""The deadline is January 31 and there are no more extensions, so we have to reach agreement,"" she told reporters, adding that sparring over textiles was not likely to lead to a trade conflict. ""We are in hopes that the consultations will continue the mood that they had in the previous consultations and that is that both sides are trying to get an agreement,"" she said. Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions. China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks. Chinese spokesman Shen said Beijing wanted to sit down to study seriously U.S. views on the textile debate. ""I believe that none of us, including the U.S. side, hopes to see a trade war,"" he said. China's large textile exports to U.S. and European customers have long been a source of diplomatic dispute but have in recent years become especially sensitive for U.S. trade officials eager to reduce Washington's swelling trade deficit. Sino-U.S. ties have been strained by disputes over issues ranging from trade to Taiwan to human rights, but tensions have eased greatly in recent months and U.S. diplomats have suggested Beijing is keen to do more to balance the trade books. As negotiatior Hayes discussed textile issues, U.S. trade official Lee Sands was due in the Chinese capital on Tuesday for meetings expected to focus on Beijing's long-stalled entry to the World Trade Organisation. Beijing has been vocal in blaming Washington for blocking its accession to the global trade club, which China wants to join on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries. ","MureDickie"
"British utility Northern Electric pumped up its defence against a takeover bid by Omaha, Neb.-based CalEnergy Inc. Tuesday with promises of higher dividends and unit mergers. Last week, CalEnergy raised its bid to 782 million British pounds ($1.29 billion) or 650 pence ($10.55) a share, from 759 million pounds ($1.23 billion), or 630 pence ($10.23) a share. Northern Electric rejected the offer, formally being made by CalEnergy's 70-percent owned British subsidiary, CE Electric UK Plc, after carefull consideration. CE Electric has also set a deadline of Dec. 20, just four days after Trade Secretary Ian Lang is expected to decide whether the bid may proceed. Northern Electric said in a statement Monday that it expected a 17 percent rise in its annual dividend to 50 pence (82 cents) per share next year with growth of more than 7 percent from then to the year 2000. Northern Electric added that it planned to merge its electricity supply business with another regional electricity company for cost savings of more than 28 million pounds ($46 million) a year. ""It's a fairly aggressive statement from Northern Electric,"" said Yamaichi utilities analyst Nigel Hawkins. The utility, based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, spent 560 million pounds ($920 million) a year ago on a package of shareholder benefits to fight off a takeover bid by construction company Trafalgar House, and has strived to reduce its debt since. ""We are saying the company is worth at least as much as we said before ... and clearly it is worth more than 650 pence per share,"" Northern Electric Chairman David Morris said in an interview. Morris said Northern Electric would have a ""broadly equal partnership"" in its plans for merging its electricity supply business with another firm. He declined to name the utility involved in talks but said it ""may well not be a nearby one."" Neighbouring Yorkshire Electricity earlier Tuesday said in an interview that it had not held talks with Northern on the issue. Northern Electric has said a price of 700 pence ($11.50) was indicated before CE Electric launched its bid, a claim which the Americans have consistently denied. Northern Electric rushed out half-year results at the end of November and said its debt position should ease to around half previous expectations by March 1997 as it pushed for an increase in CE Electric's bid price. ""This is an exercise in re-arranging the deckchairs on the good ship 'Scorched Earth,'"" said a spokesman for CE Electric, which has already secured 33.27 percent of its target. Northern Electric is just the latest British regional electric company to become a takeover target. Seven of the original 12 cash-rich regional electricity companies set up in a 1990 privatisation have already been snapped up by predators, three going to U.S. companies. Of the remaining five, East Midlands Electricity has agreed to a $2.15 billion takeover by Dominion Resources Inc. of Richmond, Va., while talks between U.S.-based Entergy Corp. of New Orleans and London Electric were called off last month.

"The Busang gold discovery in Indonesia -- touted by Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining"" according to a report released on Sunday. In a stunning report to Bre-X, consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. said it found evidence of tampering with Bre-X core samples taken from the Busang site, located deep in the jungles of Borneo. ""The magnitude of the tampering with core samples that we believe has occurred and resulting falsification of assay values at Busang, is of a scale and over a period of time and with a precision that, to our knowledge, is without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world,"" the report said. Strathcona said it did not find an economic gold deposit in the southeast zone of the Busang property, the area claimed by Bre-X to contain about 71 million ounces of gold. The report said an economic deposit was unlikely. The Toronto Stock Exchange said on Sunday that it would halt trading in Bre-X shares on Monday ""in light of the extremely negative report from Strathcona."" Bre-X's stock closed up 19 cents (14 cents) at C$3.23 ($2.34) on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday. Bre-X chairman David Walsh, the maverick mining executive who gambled his last C$10,000 ($7,200) on finding Busang, said the company was ""devastated"" by Strathcona's findings. ""We share the shock and dismay of our shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there,"" Walsh said in a statement on Sunday. As the fallout from Sunday's announcement reverberated through the world mining community, Walsh had little to say to reporters as he sped away from Bre-X's Calgary headquarters where shareholders and reporters had gathered. ""I think our press release says it all for now,"" he said. The report spells the end of Bre-X, said gold analyst John Ing of Maison Placements Canada in Toronto. ""Bre-X has got nothing, that's what it means,"" Ing said in a telephone interview. ""They've got nothing but lawsuits on their hands,"" he said. With billions of dollars in limbo, nervous shareholders have traded rumors for weeks on Internet chat sites while they waited for the Strathcona report. Some Bre-X shareholders who stood by the company during the recent turmoil now lay the blame at Walsh's feet. ""He should be prosecuted to full extent of the law,"" Chris Laughren, a  construction worker, told Reuters on Sunday as he waited outside Bre-X's headquarters. Laughren said he has lost C$7,500 ($5,400) on Bre-X stock, or ""three months work down the drain."" Walsh said in a statement on Sunday he would do all he could to protect Bre-X's remaining assets ""for the benefit of the shareholders."" A penny-stock exploration firm before it discovered Busang in 1993, Bre-X quickly became the darling of the Toronto Stock Exchange amid glowing reports of Busang's potential. But rumors began swirling around Bre-X and its Busang deposit after the March 19 apparent suicide of Bre-X's top geologist in Indonesia. Michael de Guzman allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter while en route to a meeting with officials at Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc, one of Bre-X's partners in the Busang project. A week later on March 26, New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan said that its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold. The reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Bre-X's head of exploration John Felderhof and his team of geologists, including de Guzman. The last estimate of 71 million ounces of gold was calculated by assay firm Kilborn SNC Lavalin, a unit of Montreal-based SNC Lavalin Inc. Kilborn has already said it was not responsible for sampling. After the Freeport-McMoRan report Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona, a well-respected Canadian mining consulting firm, to review its Busang project. The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion U.S.) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11). A Freeport spokesman said on Sunday the company had no immediate comment, but would release a statement before North American financial markets opened on Monday. ""Our response is we're aware Bre-X has released a news release,"" spokesman Garland Robinette said. Freeport said last month it would ""elect to participate in the Busang project only if development is, in (Freeport's) opinion, economically feasible."" Disgruntled shareholders have already launched at least eight class action lawsuits. The Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's top securities regulator, is investigating Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws. Increasing attention is being paid to personal trades by Walsh, his wife and other company officials in 1996, which netted them about C$77 million ($55 million). Less than a year ago, Bre-X was the target of an intense bidding war as several heavyweight mining firms battled for control of possibly the world's richest gold discovery. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"Australian television network, The Seven Network Ltd, is expected to report a 25-30 percent higher pre-abnormal annual net profit on Monday, but analysts said this rise was likely to disguise a second half profit slowdown. ""Second half sales growth is going to be quite modest because the Ten Network and Seven lost to Nine,"" said one Sydney analyst. ""And post-Olympics the group hasn't bounced back,"" he said. Seven had the Australian TV rights to the Atlanta Olympic Games, after it closed its books on June 30.   The median forecast in BZW Australia's Barceps survey of analysts was for a pre-abnormals net profit for the year to June 30 of A$114 million. Forecasts range from A$105 million to A$120.7 million and compares with the A$88.5 million posted in 1994/95. But that 1994/95 figure was cut heavily by a bungle over discounted advertising rates, which cost Seven A$20-30 million and which has been reversed. A A$114 million net profit would also represent slow growth from the already booked first half profit of A$91.88 million.   Seven managing director Gary Rice said in April he expected a better second half in 1995/96 than for the discounting-affected second half of 1994/95. Seven has also said it expected advertising sales in 1995/96 would be six to seven percent higher for the year, after sales growth of 7.5 percent in the first half of 1995/96. Analysts said ratings losses to the dominant Nine Network, owned by Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, had softened advertising sales. The Ten Network, majority owned by Canada's Canwest, had also been hit by Nine's strength, they said.   Some said higher costs linked to an expansion of news and current affairs programming may also restrain second half profits. ""Most people will be looking out to see that the move to more news and current affairs will not have caused a blowout in costs,"" said Burdett, Buckridge and Young media analyst Vince Pepe. ""They'll also be looking for Seven's future strategy in relation to news and current affairs, given the existing strategy appears to have floundered in some time slots,"" Pepe said.   Seven recently cancelled a new 5.00 p.m. national news programme after a short trial because of poor ratings and the recently launched Witness flagship current affairs programme has not been a runaway ratings hit. Other analysts said Seven may have contained its costs. ""Costs have been pretty well contained in the four to five percent industry range, by dropping costs and laying off people quietly to accommodate the extra news and current affairs push,"" said a Sydney media analyst. Analysts would also focus on further details about the future of Hollywood film studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.   Seven and Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp agreed in July to pay US$1.3 billion for the studio. ""We'll be looking for any further indications on MGM because when the actual transaction has been completed I believe the business plan there will have changed quite considerably,"" said Pepe. Seven itself is 15 percent owned by News Corp Ltd and about 20 percent owned by Seven chairman Kerry Stokes. Seven's shares were down five cents at A$3.80 at 2.15 p.m. (0415 GMT). -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","BernardHickey"
"Ivory Coast is planning to streamline management of mining policy to cut red tape and attract more investors to its expanding gold mining sector. ""There should be some big changes in about three weeks,"" a foreign advisor to the Ministry of Mines told Reuters. ""Existing rules will not change but management will be tightened to make things run smoothly."" Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, introduced a new mining code in 1996 to simplify rules for investors and broaden its agriculture-dependent economy.   Ministry of Mines officials said around 24 companies holding a total of over 55 exploration permits were searching mainly for gold and nickel. Firms rushing to West Africa since the Cold War ended have been attracted by Ivorian political and mining code reforms. Three new permits were approved in March alone but prospectors, and two working gold mines, point to bureaucracy which they say still dogs operations. They want decision times cut and better coordination between mining and other ministries.   ""What the Minister of Finance and what the Minister of Mines says are two different things,"" Philippe Palanque, managing director of Ivory Coast's largest mine, SMI (Societe des Mines d'Ity), which is prospecting around its existing site. ""Administrative decisions are sometimes taken all the way up to the Prime Minister,"" said another exploration geologist.   Ivory Coast's annual gold output of less than three tonnes a year is dwarfed by mining giant Ghana's annual output of 40 tonnes. Recent finds in Mali are set to at least double national production to over 10 tonnes, but underlying Birimian greenstone geology is similar throughout the sub-region. ""Ivory Cost had no mining experience like Ghana, so development has been slow while Mali and Burkina have raced ahead in the 1990's,"" Joe Hinzer, General Manager at Ivory Coast's other gold mine SOMIAF (Societe Miniere d'Afema) told Reuters.   ""Ivory Coast has good potential but discoveries like Ghana and Mali follow no rhyme or reason,"" said one geologist, adding that a find of one million ounces would be seen as good. SMI opened in 1990 and was privatised last year. It predicts a gold production, by leaching ores with cyanide, of 1,523 kilos in 1996/97 after ouptut of 1,276 last year. SOMIAF says its production is set to jump to 935 kilos against 565 last year and has started feasibility studies for expanding operations in the next three years.   Newcomers are undeterrred by small gold ouptut, pointing to geological potential, infrastructure, and political stability. ""(The mining code) is not a star example but it works. There are some pretty good tax exemptions,"" says Peter Pelly, geologist for South Africa-based Gencor which, with other firms, has joined a gold rush to West Africa. Exploration companies are given a customs duty waiver on imports but they say red tape delays securing the exemption. State participation in projects has waned however, with mining develpment arm SODEMI a candidate for privatisation.   ""In the last year since the mining act a lot of companies have gone straight into ventures without Sodemi,"" says Gencor. Mining firms arriving in Ivory Coast in the early 1990's are still tied into joint-ventures but benefit from 30 years of mapping and prospection by SODEMI. ""Sodemi is improving as it gains more experience but at one stage we almost pulled out as the goal posts kept changing,"" said one geologist, citing problems over board representation.   Other mining and investment laws give the state a free ride of 10 percent of mining profits but allow firms to repatriate funds and dividends. Taxes are now levied at three percent of turnover rather than profits, while tax breaks apply for mining investments of 500 million CFA or more. Processing time for permits of up to 1000 square km, valid for three years but renewable twice for two years, was slashed from over a year to a few weeks.   ""The fiscal regime is also better but there needs to be more work on banking and accounts as well as uniform implementation of different mining code provisions,"" said one mine manager. Ivorian officials say relaxation of unwritten gold sales rules are being considered. Gold from SMI is currently marketed at spot rates through West Africa's central bank, (BCEAO). ""We are paid the going gold rate but payments are often delayed,"" says Planque. ""We cannot raise loans against the gold or stabilise profits on the futures market,""   SMI, which is planning to open a new gold mine as part of a French (BRGM) and Australian (Normandy Mining) group, La Source, also wants clearer rules on illegal mining at its proposed site. ""At the moment there are too many, over 5,000, artisanal miners from Liberia, Guinea and Mali,"" says Palanque. -- Abidjan newsroom, = 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"Regional telephone companies reported strong fourth-quarter results Tuesday, powered by growing demand for Internet phone lines, wireless and other services like caller ID and call waiting. While the marketplace is growing quickly, the companies' shares continue to be overshadowed by the uncertainties of head-to-head competition with long distance companies, which are hoping to gobble up major chunks of the local phone markets at the end of the year. NYNEX Corp. said its net income grew 10 percent to $416.5 million, or 95 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $378.7 million, or 88 cents a share, in the 1995 period. Consolidated revenue edged up 0.9 percent to $3.33 billion from $3.30 billion. It was reduced by a change in accounting for directory revenues, the assessment of prior-period service rebates and Nynex's decision not to stimulate certain markets while it was in the process of improving services. Bell Atlantic Corp. said its profits, depressed by one-time items, fell to $346 million, or 79 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $392 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion. Excluding one-time gains and losses, however, Bell Atlantic's operating income grew 7.3 percent to $424 million from $395 million. ""We posted strong gains in our key communications markets in 1996 as we prepare to complete our merger with NYNEX in 1997,"" said Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond W. Smith. The two companies agreed to merge in April 1996, hoping to create a company with over $50 billion in market capitalisation. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of March. ""Robust market demand for our communications products and services has produced record revenue growth and record earnings that will strengthen our competitiveness in existing markets and support our entry into significant new markets such as in-region long distance,"" Smith said. For the year, Bell Atlantic earned $1.88 billion, or $4.28 a share, on revenue of $13.1 billion. In 1995, the company earned $1.86 billion, or $4.24 a share, on sales of $13.4 billion. ""Both Bell Atlantic and Nynex reported better than expected results compared to analysts' consensus,"" said Bill Vogel, analyst at brokers Dillon Reed. ""Bell Atlantic had a very strong and robust quarter. There were quite a few charges in the quarter, fundamental volumes of the business are at or above expectations,"" he said. ""For NYNEX it was the first back-to-back years with double-digit earnings growth."" SBC Communications Inc., parent of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., said its net income rose 4.8 percent to $542.9 million, or 90 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $517.8 million, or 85 cents a share, in the year-ago period. ""Our outstanding financial performance was driven by excellent results by our wireline and wireless businesses, as strong demand and effective marketing led to the addition of a total of 1.5 million customer lines during the year,"" said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman and chief executive. Pacific Telesis Group, with which SBC is merging, is expected to report earnings later Tuesday. Southwestern Bell had an outstanding year, with revenues up a record 8.9 percent, compared with 5.8 percent in 1995. The growth was driven by a 9.7 percent increase in local service revenue, up from 7 percent a year ago. Southwestern Bell added 732,000 access lines during 1996 and 156,000 during the fourth quarter, compared with 611,000 during 1995 and 149,000 in the fourth quarter a year ago, for a total of 15.0 million access lines at the end of the year. Caller ID, one of SBC's flagship products, expanded its market penetration to nearly 37 percent. ","NickLouth"
"In what may be a break in a 15-day strike against a maker of automotive seats, negotiators for Johnson Controls Inc. and the United Auto Workers spoke for several hours late Monday and early Tuesday. The renewed discussions came hours after Ford Motor Co. said it would re-start its Expedition production line with seats from Lear Corp., Johnson Control's chief competitor in the auto seat business. ""We're hopeful there will be some additional discussions,"" said JCI spokesman Jeff Steiner. No talks were held later Tuesday, but Steiner characterised the negotiations as being adjourned, compared with previous sessions where talks broke off completely. The two sides had not spoken since late Thursday, Feb. 6. Unable to agree on terms for a new contract, about 500 UAW members at JCI seat plants in Plymouth, Mich., and Oberlin, Ohio, walked off the job Jan. 28. In addition to the Expedition full-size sport/utility, the plants make seats for Ford's Econoline and Club Wagon full-size vans. Ford refused to accept seats made by non-union replacement workers, but continued making vehicles in hopes the strike would be settled soon. After it made 14,800 Expeditions and Econolines without seats, Ford last Friday suspended production on three assembly lines in Michigan and Ohio, idling 6,800 workers. The automaker reversed direction again Monday, saying it was devising plans to resume Expedition production with seats from Lear. The popular sport/utility, introduced last fall, is one of Ford's most profitable vehicles, earning what analysts estimate at $10,000 each in pre-tax profits. The Expeditions are made only at Ford's Michigan Assembly plant in Wayne, Mich. Once production resumes, some 4,000 of the 6,800 workers idled would go back to work. The shutdown has been a costly one for Ford. In addition to losing 840 Expeditions a day, the plant has also been forced to halt production of the hot-selling F-150 pickup trucks. Steiner confirmed that JCI has moved fabrication equipment and frame-making tools out of the Plymouth plant and into its metal seat frame plant in Cadiz, Ky. The plant, which is represented by the United Steelworkers union, is one of six JCI facilities that has union representation. Milwaukee, Wis.-based JCI has a total of 34 plants in the United States. JCI chose the Cadiz plant because it has extra floor space to accommodate the machinery, Steiner said. Under the plan announced Monday, JCI will make frames for both Lear and Ford. Lear will produce second and third row seats for Expeditions, and Ford will make front-row seats at its Chesterfield, Mich., trim plant. ","ToddNissen"
"Hong Kong property prices have tumbled 10 percent from recent peaks and are poised to fall further as speculators turn nervous following recent steps by the government to cool the market, analysts said on Wednesday. Transactions have also dipped and some buyers have reneged on contracts, preferring to forego deposits rather than face further possible price falls, real estate brokers said. ""Sentiment on the property market has turned bearish,"" said Raymond Ngai, property analyst with UBS Securities. ""There will be a consolidation and property prices will fall by up to 20 percent by the end of this quarter,"" he said. Property brokers said prices have already fallen five to 10 percent from recent peaks. The bearish sentiment comes after the government, under intense pressure to cool sharply rising prices, in late March took steps to speed the flow of new flats into the market. Flats can now be presold 15 months before completion, up from 12 months, and developers must offer them no more than six months after receiving government approval for presales in batches no smaller than 20 percent of the total available. Compounded by a 25 basis point rise in prime lending rates to 8.75 percent, the bubble enveloping Hong Kong's property market has sprung a leak, analysts said. Prices have dipped by at least five percent in the last week compared to better weeks seen in late 1996 and early 1997, while the number of transactions in popular private estates in Hong Kong have dipped five percent, real estate brokers said. In some flashy locations like the Midlevels on Hong Kong island, some buyers or speculators have even reneged on deals, preferring to forego their deposits as they feared taking up mortgages in the face of falling prices, brokers said. ""Some people have reneged on deals, as many as two out of 10 units, especially in the pricier districts,"" said one property consultant who declined to be named. ""It's now a buyer's market, buyers call the shots,"" said May Toh, a broker with Glory Property Company. Secretary for Housing Dominic Wong said confirmers, traders buy a property and then resell it before assignment procedures are completed whose activities give a broad indication of speculation, were cutting prices to move their holdings. Some analysts described the thaw in prices as healthy because the sharp ascent in the last year was unsustainable. The government curbs and the interest rate hike were merely catalysts for a correction that was long overdue, they said. ""Over the last six months, property prices have gone up very sharply, by 30 percent, so it is a healthy development now, with the market consolidating,"" Ngai said. ""The curbs, interest rate increase were just catalysts for the downturn in sentiment, the main reason is because prices went up too fast,"" Ngai said. Tycoon Lee Shau-kee, chairman of Henderson Land Development Co Ltd, told Reuters on Wednesday residential property prices should stabilise after falling five to 10 percent. ""Property prices in the secondary market have fallen five to 10 percent in April from (levels) in early March and turnover has been reduced significantly,"" Lee said. ""The prices should stabilise after the recent adjustment."" Housing in Hong Kong is notoriously expensive and many of its 6.4 million population fear being unable to buy homes. Irked by sharply rising prices since mid 1996, anonymous residents have planted a fake bomb and threatened to poison top government officials who they accuse of ignoring the problem. -- HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 2843-6441 ","TanEeLyn"
"Scandal-tainted Japanese brokerage Nomura Securities Co plunged into the red on a net basis last business year after incurring a hefty special loss due to a cash injection to a troubled subsidiary. But the nation's biggest brokerage said on Thursday it enjoyed a healthy jump in its current profit in the year to March, helped by income from bond trading and underwriting. Nomura, mired in controversy over a scandal linking it with ""sokaiya"" racketeers, said it posted a parent net loss 271.51 billion yen ($2.15 billion) in 1996/97 against a profit of 23.1 billion yen ($183 million) in 1995/96. This largely reflects a special loss of 371 billion yen ($2.94 billion) resulting from Nomura's aid to its troubled financial affiliate Nomura Finance Co. The brokerage meanwhile recorded a parent current profit of 124.19 billion yen ($985 million) in the year, up 35.7 percent year-on-year and the highest in six years. Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains and losses made on investments. On a group basis, Nomura said it posted a net loss of 91.07 billion yen ($722 million) in 1996/97 after a profit of 81.27 billion yen ($645 million) the year before under U.S. accounting rules. Japan's securities industry suffered a major setback last month when Nomura said two of its directors were involved in suspected illegal deals in which substantial sums of Nomura money were moved to the account of a corporate customer who was linked to a sokaiya. The outlook for Nomura's business remains gloomy. It has already been hit hard by the scandal, which has led many clients to refrain from trading with it. In March alone, Nomura's current profit dropped to about half the usual monthly levels due to the scandal, which cut its brokerage commissions and its share of the underwriting market, a company executive said on Thursday. ""As one might expect, the scandal has had an effect (on our profits),"" Nomura director Takamichi Arata told reporters. But he added it was hard to calculate the extent of the impact. Arata said the brokerage hopes to post a parent current profit this month and in succeeding months by cutting operating costs. Nomura was cutting its monthly operating expenditures to between 20.2 billion and 20.3 billion yen (about $161 million) per month in April, down two billion yen ($15.8 million) from March, he said. That would be 22 percent below the peak of 26 billion yen ($206 million) five years ago, Arata said. Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo bourse fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it had held since February 1992. Analysts said the fate of Nomura's business this financial year hinges on how hard the Ministry of Finance comes down on the brokerage after regulators complete their investigation. Japanese media reports say the authorities could suspend some of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as a penalty for the scandal. Such a penalty would be the heaviest ever imposed on a securities firm in Japan. Nomura on Monday announced that its president and 15 board members will resign on May 1 to take responsibility for the scandal. ($1=126 yen) ","FumikoFujisaki"
"Colombia prepared on Sunday for the start of a nationwide strike on Tuesday that promises to be the largest in 20 years, according to labor leaders and the security forces. Talks between union chiefs and government ministers aimed at averting the stoppage by more than 800,000 state workers broke down in the early hours on Sunday. State workers were demanding a 21.5 percent pay hike, compared to the weighted 13.5 percent government pay offer, and were protesting at what they say are the whittling away of labor rights and government plans for the privatization of state-run industries. The government issued a communique on Sunday saying: ""The salary demands far exceed the government's current financial capacity ... The suspension of national and regional privatization processes would affect the improvement of efficiency of public services."" The unions began drawing up last minute plans for the nationwide shutdown that could paralyze all but essential public services. The police and armed forces, meanwhile, announced beefed-up security measures to curb radical protest and what they say is the possibility of leftist guerrilla attacks, timed to coincide with the industrial action. A police spokesman said roadside checkpoints would be set up across the country and at key entry points to the capital. In many cities, local authorities imposed blanket bans on carrying firearms and banned motorcyclists from carrying passengers. Colombian contract killers sometimes gun down their victims from the back of a motorcycle. ""The government's lack of respect and claims of guerrilla infiltration show it is trying to discredit the labor movement,"" said Wilson Borja, head of the main public sector union FENALTRASE. ""Because of the arbitrary behavior of the police and the military, we believe the security forces will try and stir up trouble against the workers,"" he added. A decision by the chief prosecutor's office to reopen investigations against 16 telephone workers for actions during a strike four years ago and the recent arrest of more than 10 oil workers, accused of links to the National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second largest guerrilla force, further incensed union bosses. Political analysts and newspaper columnists drew tentative parallels with Ecuador's reigning political crisis, which began with a 48-hour general strike and ended with the ouster of President Abdala Bucaram. ""I don't think anything similar to Ecuador will happen here. It would be strange that citizens who have not mobilized in two years of political crisis did so now ... but one cannot completely rule out the possibility that the union protest could be the detonator for the ill-feeling that has built up in many sectors of society,"" wrote Enrique Santos, one of the heads of Colombia's leading El Tiempo newspaper.

"Harnischfeger Industries Inc. said Friday it offered to buy Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc., a Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based maker of industrial automation products and machine tools, for about $747 million, including assumption of debt. It said the $19-per-share offer has a value of about $747 million, based on the approximately 33.2 million shares of Giddings &amp; Lewis stock now outstanding and including the assumption of Giddings &amp; Lewis debt. The price represents a premium of about 40 percent over Friday's closing price on Giddings &amp; Lewis's stock of $13.625 per share. Harnischfeger Chief Executive officer Jeffery Glade said the company would have to take on ""significant"" debt to finance the deal, but added that financing was in place.

He added that he expected the deal would add to Harnischfeger earnings immediately upon closing and that with growth, the debt would be paid down quickly. He added that Milwaukee-based Harnischfeger would use Giddings &amp; Lewis to help improve its aftermarket service to the machine tool and material handling business. ""We'll be within 24 hours of any major plant in the United States,"" Glade said. ""That's what happens if you put our business with ours."" Harnischfeger is not looking to cut plants or lay off employees if it succeeds in its offer, Glade said. ""What we intend to do is grow this little baby,"" Glade said. ""We think we can sell more and become a better service provider."" The transaction would create an enterprise with combined 1996 revenues of $3.6 billion with operations in mining equipment, pulp and papermaking machinery, and industrial products and services. Harnischfeger said it made its offer in a letter dated April 25 from Glade to Giddings &amp; Lewis President and Chief Executive Officer Marvin Isles. Harnischfeger had been talking to Giddings &amp; Lewis about an acquisition since Monday, then made the offer Friday after receiving what it considered a rejection from Giddings &amp; Lewis' board, Glade said. Giddings &amp; Lewis would not comment on its discussions with Harnischfeger. In a news release late Friday, the company urged shareholders not to act on the Harnischfeger offer until its board of directors reviewed the offer and the company's alternatives. Harnischfeger is an international holding company with businesses involved in the manufacture and distribution of equipment for underground mining, surface mining, pulp and papermaking and material handling. Glade said Harnischfeger had alternatives to Giddings &amp; Lewis, but that Giddings &amp; Lewis was the best choice. He would not say at what price Giddings &amp; Lewis remains the best alternative.

"A powerful earthquake struck northwest China on Saturday, killing at least two people and injuring three in an area where about 50 people died in a tremor in January, officials said. The earthquake measuring 6.0 on the open-ended Richter scale jolted Jiashi county in the northwestern region of Xinjiang at 2.04 p.m. (0604 GMT), an official with the local office of the State Seismological Bureau said. ""It is now known that two people have died and two have been seriously injured,"" the official said. A seismological official in the regional capital of Urumqi said a total of three people had been injured. The tremor badly frightened the district's residents, many of whom are sheep herders or cotton farmers, and sent people spilling out into the streets, said one official with a local television station. ""It was really strong. Our building and everything in it was rattling, the building shook really fiercely,"" the television official said. ""Everyone ran out of their houses in terror, but most went back inside when it stopped shaking,"" she said, adding that many buildings around her office building had cracked, though none had collapsed. Many of the area's residents lived in earthen houses that are easily damaged by earthquakes and the casualty toll could rise, the Urumqi official said. ""We're not yet sure how many houses have collapsed. We only know initially that there were maybe more than 1,500 houses,"" the Jiashi official said. ""Houses that are a bit shoddy might be done for now and are not fit to live in,"" she said. Authorities in Jiashi had started relief activities and aid teams from other parts of Xinjiang were preparing to move in to help, the official in Urumqi said. ""Relief activities are just getting under way,"" he said. Government officials in Jiashi could not immediately be reached for comment. The tremor was one of several aftershocks from an earthquake of 6.4 magnitude that caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in Jiashi on January 21, the Jiashi seismological official said. ""This one was much smaller than the last earthquake,"" she said, adding that an aftershock of 5.0 that jostled Jiashi last week had barely been felt. That aftershock was from a tremor measuring 5.3 earlier in February, she said. No casualties were reported in either of the smaller quakes. The January earthquake caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in the area and the district has since been rocked by hundreds of aftershocks. More aftershocks were expected, officials said. ","ScottHillis"
"France's restructuring of its defence sector and the key role of state-owned Aerospatiale in that process are complicating the change in the European Airbus consortium into a limited liability company, analysts said. The four national firms in Airbus Industrie are studying the best way to convert the partnership into a faster, more efficient company, better to compete with U.S. rival Boeing Co, which is merging with McDonnell Douglas. Aerospatiale is not only the French partner in the Airbus passenger plane venture but is also involved in the two deals at the heart of France's defence industry consolidation -- the merger of Aerospatiale and combat plane maker Dassault Aviation and the privatisation of electronics firm Thomson-CSF . ""It is consistent with French strategic thinking that you must first get your house in order, then negotiate from a position of strength,"" said an industry executive. ""Aerospatiale cannot do this today in the Airbus system. It has to have weight behind it. It will have that weight when the Dassault merger is complete,"" he added. DASSAULT MERGER WILL BOOST AEROSPATIALE The Dassault merger, due to be agreed this year, will add 13 billion francs of annual turnover to Aerospatiale, creating a group with combined sales of 64 billion and giving Aerospatiale greater clout at the Airbus negotiating table. A banker close to the Airbus talks said Aerospatiale is seen as the weakest among the senior Airbus partners -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa). Casa of Spain makes up the fourth Airbus partner. But Aerospatiale will get an injection of aggressive, private-sector management with the Dassault merger. Aerospatiale executives complain bitterly that the foreign media does not give them due credit for their industrial restructuring. Their efforts turned the company round to post a 1996 net attributable profit of 812 million francs, after years of losses, and racked up sales of 51 billion francs. Their exasperation is palpable when they say their public sector tag is seen as a weakness when compared to the private sector BAe and Dasa. But analysts point out that Aerospatiale was slower in attacking its cost structure and still needs to improve. BAe underwent drastic pruning in the early 1990s, going from an empire with property, cars and military interests to a group focused on defence and aerospace. It posted 1996 pretax profits of 425 million pounds, on sales of 7.44 billion pounds. Dasa, although loss-making, has the industrial and financial strength of parent Daimler-Benz AG which has set a management target of a 12 percent return on capital. Dasa posted 1996 turnover of 13 billion marks, making it smaller than BAe and Aerospatiale, but it has huge ambitions for Airbus. A business consultant said Aerospatiale has excellent programmes, but, using benchmarking techniques, its military projects are 30 percent more costly than those of BAe and Dasa. THOMSON-CSF SALE ENHANCES PROSPECTS Apart from the Dassault merger, Aerospatiale also holds a key hand in the Thomson-CSF sell-off. The government has said bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere will have to take into account Aerospatiale's interests when putting together their offers for Thomson-CSF. Even though Aerospatiale, as a state-controlled company, cannot take part direcly in the privatisation, it will be affected by the outcome and chairman Yves Michot will give his views to the government on the rival bids. French newspapers have reported that Michot will have to observe strict neutrality in the contest. But it is clear Alcatel's plans would significantly strengthen Aerospatiale, giving it still greater weight against BAe and Dasa. If Alcatel won Thomson-CSF, it would create a missiles joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, and a satellite venture between Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF. Lagardere has said it wants a dialogue with Aerospatiale to prepare its bid. Relations between the two firms have been strained as they compete in missiles and satellites. ""The perimeter of Aerospatiale is not yet defined,"" said the industry executive. The government plans to decide on the Thomson-CSF bids by June 30. AEROSPATIALE NEEDS AIRBUS, WILL MAKE IT WORK Aerospatiale only stands to gain from the defence moves and is in no hurry to bow to pressures from BAe and Dasa to rush into an Airbus agreement which does not suit its own interests. Airbus is vitally important for Aerospatiale. Its 38 percent stake in Airbus contributed the biggest slice of 1996 operating profit, 1.175 billion francs, and around 70 percent of sales. Analysts believe of the big Airbus three, Aerospatiale needs Airbus the most, and BAe and Dasa could, in extremis, walk away if relations broke down irreparably. BAe has a 20 percent Airbus stake and has bigger military interests, while Dasa's parent Daimler-Benz gets most of its money from the auto business, through Mercedes trucks and cars. Aerospatiale has, paradoxically, maximalist and minimalist aims for the new Airbus company. For the near term, Michot takes a cautious approach in the status change, arguing that the present system has proven its worth, winning Airbus a third of the world market, coming out of nowhere in 25 years. A much bigger manufacturing concern would overstretch the management. In the long term however, Michot would like Airbus to have a military wing, to balance out economic cycles with government contracts. U.S. giant Lockheed Martin has both civil and defence sides, and Boeing will acquire McDonnell's significant military interests in the pending merger. The Airbus partners said in January they agreed in principle on the change to a single integrated company, in which the new Airbus would own its factories and design offices. Work is going on this year on valuing the assets to be vested in the new firm. That valuation is complicated as some of the factories mix civil and military programmes, and some plants are efficient while others are uncompetitive. In BAe's case this is made easy as it has a plant for making Airbus wings, and Dasa has a special production line near Hamburg for the Airbus 320 family. One way of viewing the Airbus negotiations is through the prism of conflicting cultural visions. ""This country (France) has a vision of long-term industrial strategy. It wants to be a world power and be a dominant player in the aircraft industry,"" said the industry executive. Without that vision, Airbus arguably would never have got funds to launch its first plane in the early 1970s. Set against that long-term strategic view, is the British insistence on short-term returns for shareholders, summed up as ""Let the City decide"". But Aerospatiale would not have signed the agreement on the Airbus change if it had not meant it, the executive said. ","PierreTran"
"Tobacco-industry lawyers in the $5 billion Broin secondhand smoke case on Tuesday touched off a testy outburst from the trial judge, who accused them of muddling the minds of prospective jurors with trick questions. ""We pull them apart,"" Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye told Edward Moss, an attorney for Brown &amp; Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain. ""We are playing with their heads."" Kaye, speaking towards the end of a second, slow day of jury selection in the landmark trial, criticised the questions put to jurors by Moss and attorneys for other big tobacco companies such as Philip Morris Cos Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco as too firmly aimed at uncovering anti-smoking attitudes among the prospective jurors. ""You have been playing with people's heads for two days ...,"" Kaye said. Kaye said smoking was a widely controversial practice, making it impossible to find a fully neutral jury of six and as many as a dozen alternative jurors to hear the case. Florida law only required that jurors be able to put aside their prejudices and decide on the evidence presented, he said. Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney for the 60,000 sick flight attendants represented in the Broin class-action suit, said, ""These are consumate mind games that are being played by very skilful lawyers. Their problem is that they are looking for people that live in a cave ... uninformed people."" The clash came after the questioning of a young musician who said her voice had been harmed from secondhand smoke while singing in nightclubs. But, under follow-up questioning by Kaye, she said she could set aside her belief that cigarettes should be banned in the United States and decide a verdict just on the evidence presented at the trial. Kaye refused a tobacco lawyers request that the musician be bumped as prejudiced against cigarette makers but she can be dropped later if the tobacco lawyers choose to use one of 27 juror challenges they may make without explanation. The woman was just one of six prospective jurors who survived some six hours of courtroom questioning on Tuesday. The other five included an organiser of Miami's annual Orange Bowl parade, a retired police dispatcher and a bookings manager for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. Eleven people have now made past the initial round of attorney queries. At least a dozen more people are to be questioned on Wednesday, Kaye said. Earlier, the judge sided with tobacco lawyers who opposed a Rosenblatt request that prospective jurors be questioned in groups, instead of one by one. Kaye said that, while he was eager to get a jury in place, he was worried about possible fallout from news stories on the trial and feared that inflammatory opinions expressed in open court might unfairly influence a verdict. Individual questioning of potential jurors in the case, known as Broin vs. Philip Morris et al, would continue ""so as to not infect the rest of the panel with some dangerous remarks,"" Kaye ruled. In the historic case -- the first class action and first secondhand smoke case against the tobacco industry to go to trial -- non-smoking airline flight attendants are suing nine cigarette companies for maladies they claim were caused by smoke from airline passengers' cigarettes. In the first two days of jury selection prospective jurors expressed widely varying opinions about cigarette smoking. One said secondhand smoke very likely caused disease in non-smokers while another compared lawsuits against tobacco companies for smoking-related illnesses to suing Kentucky Fried Chicken for Americans' high cholesterol. Rosenblatt has said he intends to ask for $5 billion or more in damages if tobacco companies are found liable for the lung cancer and other tobacco-related ailments among the flight attendants. Smoking on U.S. passenger jets was banned in 1988. ","MichaelConnor"
"U.S. group Entergy finally agreed a 1.267 billion pound ($2.11 billion) takeover of British regional electricity company (Rec) London Electricity on Wednesday, after talks between them were called off in November. London's chairman Sir Bob Reid ""did an excellent job of extracting a generous price out of us,"" Entergy chairman and chief executive officer Ed Lupberger told Reuters. Entergy and London, which supplies power to the capital and the City financial district, said in a joint statement that the bid valued London shares at 705 pence each and that shareholders would retain the right to receive a 14.3 pence interim dividend. Reid said the offer ""represents fair value for London Electricity and is in the best interests of London Electricity's shareholders, customers and employees."" London's shares leapt to a high of 690 pence but later eased back to be up three pence at 685 pence by 1135 GMT. Lupberger declined to comment on the process leading up to the bid. The two companies conceded in a statement in November that talks between them had broken down after the Wall Street Journal Europe reported that Entergy was considering a 1.2 billion pound bid at around 700 pence per share. Entergy said Wednesday's offer, made through bid vehicle Entergy Power UK Plc, would ""create a partnership through which both companies can pool expertise and working practices to further improve operating efficiencies."" Entergy joins two other U.S. companies which are currently pursuing Recs. Dominion Resources has agreed a $2.15 billion takeover of East Midlands Electricity and CalEnergy's CE Electric unit has made a hostile 650 pence per share bid for Northern which closes on Friday. The floodgates for further bids in the sector were opened last Friday when the British government decided CalEnergy's bid, which the market had seen as more contentious than the agreed offer, could go ahead with some conditions. Dominion's bid still awaits UK approval but analysts said there were no immediate reasons why this offer or Entergy's bid should be blocked after approval of CalEnergy's offer. Entergy's bid sparked gains in shares of Yorkshire and Southern, the only two Recs which remain independent and currently unsolicited of the original 12 cash-rich Recs created at privatisation in 1990. Yorkshire was up six pence to 765 pence on Wednesday morning while Southern gained four pence to 768. Entergy's Lupberger said taking over London Electricity would enable the U.S. firm to ""build a new opportunity in the European marketplace."" Reid said Entergy's plans to use London as a platform for expansion into Europe were particularly exciting, adding that the deal would offer opportunities all round. Entergy said the bid would also enable it to ""gain experience for the development of its U.S. business after deregulation."" Entergy, like many U.S. companies, sees the UK electricity supply sector as an attractive area to gain experience of deregulation and supply markets. Entergy is based in New Orleans and has interests there in both generation and supply of electricity. ($1=.6003 Pound) ","JoWinterbottom"
"Shuffle Master Inc Chief Executive Joseph Lahti said Monday he is not seeking to put the gaming equipment supplier up for sale, but also said it was his responsibility to consider ways that provide value to shareholders. ""Are we in play? No,"" Lahti said in an interview. But he added that if someone were to inquire about the availability of the company, ""what's the price is my next question."" Shuffle Master earlier said it would not pursue unsolicited discussions with Anchor Gaming.   Those discussions, initiated by Anchor Chairman Stanley Fulton, related to a potential business combination with Anchor, Shuffle Master said in a news release. Shuffle Master also said it believes it will be served with a lawsuit by Anchor alleging that Shuffle Master's Let It Ride game infringes on certain of Anchor's patents. Lahti said in a news release that Shuffle Master viewed any potential lawsuit as an attempt by Las Vegas-based Anchor to pressure Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Shuffle Master into a business combination.   In the interview, Lahti said Shuffle Master noted Anchor's game when it filed for its patent, yet was awarded a patent anyway. Anchor did not return telephone calls seeking comment. But one analyst was skeptical of whether Anchor would seek to acquire Shuffle Master, which is trading at about 24 times its annualized third quarter earnings of $0.13 a share. ""I find Anchor being interested highly unlikely,"" said Stuart Linde, analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co, who rates Shuffle Master a sell. ""I think Anchor's more intent on making an acquisition in the casino sector."" He said an acquisition of Shuffle Master at current prices would be dilutive for Anchor. Shuffle Master shares fell 1/8 to 11-5/8 Monday, while Anchor's stock price fell 5/8 to 52-3/4, both on Nasdaq. Another analyst said Shuffle Master could be part of consolidation in the gaming equipment business. ""Consolidation on the supply side really hasn't occurred yet,"" said Robert Evans, analyst at John G. Kinnard &amp; Co. ""It wouldn't be surprising if it did."" --Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787 ","BradDorfman"
"Just when they thought their strategy had been accepted by the market, British banks which are heavily involved in investment banking, are seeing their policy fundamentally questioned again. Barclays and NatWest, who both have aspirations to build global investment banks to compete with the ""bulge-bracket"" Wall Street firms, have had a tough month. First, BZW, the Barclays unit, posted a massive 29 percent fall in profits for 1996 -- a year which, especially in the bond markets, saw large profits for the big American houses. Barclays' chief executive Martin Taylor, who has staked a lot on dragging BZW into the top league, vigorously defended the large cash injection into the investment bank. ""You have to be careful not to be frightened of your own shadow,"" he told Reuters in an interview last month. ""The reason that the returns are depressed this year is that we're spending so much,"" adding that BZW would be weaker without the investment. Taylor has brought in some big and expensive names, like Bill Harrison of Flemings, to lead BZW through its next development stage but the markets may be running out of patience. Meanwhile, at NatWest Markets, which has followed an acquisitive strategy over the past year, reputation and morale has suffered a direct hit from a stunning 90 million pound ($142.8 million) loss on derivatives. This laid bare problems of control in what had been considered a tight ship steered by chief executive Martin Owen. Owen has publicly admitted that the affair has holed NatWest Markets but only ""above the waterline"". Its strategy was already being questioned before the derivatives debacle in much the same terms as that of BZW -- that it was buying units to bolt onto its core at the height of the market cycle. Compared to banks like Lloyds TSB, firmly entrenched in a UK bancassurance strategy, analysts question how investment banking will add to shareholder value. Panmure Gordon banking analyst David Poutney has described the banks' commitment to investment banking as ""lemming-like"" and the returns from the business as ""paltry"". Analysts are dismayed at the commitment to cost growth in the investment banks but have been reassured that both are making continuing strides in restructuring and reprofiling their retail business though this is likely to become even more fiercely competitive in the near-term,. At the moment, the jury still seems to be out but one analyst, who declined to be named, said the market will probably give BZW and NatWest Markets a couple of years to start showing what they can do. The danger is that the market cycle could be against them. ""They have taken on a lot of staff and invested and acquired at the top of the cycle,"" the analyst said. ""If the market correction which people have been predicting happens in the second half of this year it will mean that profits will be hard to come by in 1997 and 1998."" Already, rumours circulate that Barclays is looking to unload BZW and concentrate on improving the already highly respectable return produced by the retail banking side. But the bank dismisses this talk. However, Panmure's Poutney said in a recent note, ""(A sale or demerger) would be massively bullish, and cynics who share our view should buy the shares."" After nailing their colours so firmly to the investment banking mast, Taylor and Wanless would have a lot of explaining to do if they came, belatedly, to the same conclusion that Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Brian Pitman has been expounding for years. Pitman has never liked the cyclical nature of investment banking profits and has presided over a stunning performance by Lloyds TSB which has better returns than any UK retail bank. ""Soon, people are going to demand a pay-back from all this investment,"" said another banking analyst. ""When that happens, there had better be some good answers or the market will not like it.""

"Prudential Corp said on Tuesday its injection of funds into Scottish Amicable's life fund had probably clinched its bid for the mutually-owned life company, Prudential chief executive Sir Peter Davis told Reuters. ""Our offer used the strength of our balance sheet and the Prudential life fund,"" Davis said. ""We've put together an imaginative structure with the key difference being the capital injection or support we've offered of up to 1.3 billion stg to the (ScotAm) life fund.""   Davis said the boost to ScotAm's fund -- the company will be run as a completely separate entity under the Prudential umbrella -- will mean that it will be able to have a more flexible investment policy which could include a greater proportion of investments in equities. This in turn could raise returns. The 1.3 billion stg investment comes from Prudential's life fund, which totals 51 billion stg, and will be provided to ScotAm at a commercial rate. The merger, creating Scottish Amicable Life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in June. The proposals will be subject to a 75 percent vote in favour by eligible members.   Davis said that on an embedded value or accruals basis, the merger would be earnings enhancing straight away but that on a modified accounting basis, which only takes account of profits on a new policy as bonuses start to be paid, the merger would be slightly dilutive for a couple of years. The Prudential is paying 850 million stg from its shareholders' funds and its life fund. Coupled with the injection of up to 1.3 billion stg, this will allow the release of around 900 million stg over time from the ScotAm life fund to its policyholders. Davis said ScotAm will develop more successfully with Prudential's capital backing and is expected to show a larger rate of growth. ","JoeOrtiz"
"British regional electricity company (Rec) London Electricity, recently a focus of bid speculation, turned in a dip in half year profits on Thursday but hiked its dividend spurring its shares. London, which supplies power to the capital, saw pretax profits for the six months to September 30 dip to 69.3 million pounds ($114.4 million), down from 84.5 million a year ago, hit by a pricing review which came into effect earlier this year. It paid out an interim dividend of 14.3 pence per share, up from 11.5 pence previously and towards the top end of expectations. ""That was better than we expected for the dividend rise and that seems to have boosted shares,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. Shares had jumped 15 pence to 655 pence by 1315 GMT. Chairman Sir Bob Reid said in the statement that ""looking ahead, our priority remains our distribution network."" London said both regulated and private networks would see investment with an emphasis on cost efficiency aimed at maximising shareholder value. But it warned that recent tax changes on capital allowances proposed in the British budget in November would necessitate a re-examination of long-term investment strategy. ""We would hope that elements within our programmes...which provide environmental and social benefits to London are excluded from the (budget) proposals and that long-term investment is not discouraged,"" the company said in a statement. London said it ""remained committed to seeking profitable and mutually beneficial alliances in supply as a means of improving long-term returns through economies of scale."" Newspaper reports earlier this week had suggested London was the Rec cited by Northern Electric as a potential partner for merging its supply business as part of its defence against a 650 pence per share bid from U.S. group CE Electric. Northern said the proposed move could mean joint cost savings of over 28 million pounds a year. Neither Northern nor London would comment on the newspaper reports, but in its statement on Thursday, London said its approach to supply was ""pragmatic."" London, one of three remaining Recs which are independent and without a pending bid, saw talks with U.S. energy group Entergy called off last month. It made no reference to those discussions in its results statement but is still considered a potential bid target although any offers are likely to wait until the British government decides whether two pending bids can go ahead, analysts said. Trade Secretary Ian Lang is expected to decide by December 16 whether to allow the bid for Northern by CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., should go ahead.

"The Justice Department is investigating possible bid-rigging during airwaves auctions held by the federal government for wireless phone licenses. Justice Department documents obtained by Reuters Wednesday showed the department's antitrust division also was looking into whether bidders schemed illegally to divvy up the licenses being sold. The Federal Communications Commission has raised more than $20 billion since 1995 by selling licenses to companies offering a new generation of cellular phone service known as ""personal communications services,"" or PCS. A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the investigation. She said the antitrust division was ""looking into the possibility of anti-competitive conduct by bidders in connection with the FCC's auctioning of spectrum for PCS."" She declined to specify which auctions were being investigated or provide additional details. The department documents focus on the PCS auction that ended in mid-January and raised $2.5 billion. At that auction, the FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making it the most licenses sold at once. A third of the licenses were reserved for small companies. Top bidders were units of Sprint Corp., AT&amp;T Corp. and BellSouth Corp. A spokesman for BellSouth said the company had not been informed by the government of any investigation. It was not immediately known whether the other two companies were targets or had been contacted regarding the probe. An attorney familiar with the investigation said the department has sent out ""numerous"" letters requesting information and documents from auction participants. The ""civil investigative demand"" seeks information about companies' bids, their bidding strategies and communications about the auction with other telecommunications firms. In a sign that the investigation was looking into the possibility of bid ""signaling"" among participants, the department requested documents showing the last three digits of company bids. One attorney familiar with the investigation said it was evident during the bidding that companies used the last three digits of their dollar bidding figure to signal their intentions to other auction participants. ""It's clear a certain amount of this was taking place,"" said the attorney, who spoke on condition of not being identified. ","RogerFillion"
"British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc defied a steep rise in newsprint costs to post a small profit increase on Wednesday. Pre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39 million pounds ($60.6 million). This came despite an increase of 18 million pounds in the cost of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed. ""Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,"" chief executive David Montgomery said. ""The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,"" he added. Exceptional credits of 12.9 million pounds were realised, principally from the settlement of property related issues. Interim dividend was increased to 1.35p from 1.2p. Market reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding 5.5p to 207p by 1210 GMT after earlier hitting 210p. Mirror Group's flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain's second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television. Finance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million. The group forecast that the price per tonne of newsprint should decline to 475 pounds in the second half of the year from 520 pounds in the first six months. It said its annual newsprint bill could climb as high as 131 million pounds in 1996, an increase of 20 million pounds, and noted that the pricing trend remained uncertain. The Mirror's Television arm had losses of 4.2 million pounds, stemming from start-up costs at its Live TV local cable service. Live TV's offbeat style, including programmes such as topless darts, has earned it hefty criticism but the company said it was an under-valued asset. It said that a recent independent assessment had valued the company at up to 90 million pounds and added there were no plans to dispose of it. Live TV is connected to 1.45 million households -- 94 percent of all UK cable homes.

"The United States on Tuesday raised the stakes in a battle to supply NATO aspirants in central Europe with advanced fighter aircraft by offering the Czechs free use of seven Navy Hornet aircraft for five years. Representatives of the U.S. Navy on behalf of the U.S. government offered to lease the Czech Republic seven McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 ""Hornet"" fighter planes under a no-cost, five-year agreement, McDonnell Douglas said in a statement. ""The offer (to the Czech government) is for the no-cost, five-year leasing of six single-seat F/A-18A and one two-seat F/A-18B aircraft,"" said the statement, issued by the Prague representative of McDonnell Douglas Corp. The offer included the supply, at cost, of replacement parts, pilot and ground personnel training programmes and support equipment. Also competing for post-Cold War business in central Europe are U.S. Lockheed Martin, which makes F-16's primarily for the U.S. airforce, the Anglo-Swedish consortium of SAAB and British Aerospace, which makes the ""Gripen"", and France's Dassault Aviation makers of the ""Mirage"". The Czech government, seeking to prepare for eventual membership in NATO, has been debating decisions on buying any aircraft as proposed cuts in defence spending have clouded the debate over the upgrading of the fleet. The Czechs, along with Poland and Hungary, are seen as leading candidates for early NATO membership, when the western security alliance expands. Czech defence officials have said they have the will but not the wallet to buy brand new western-made advanced fighters, but are keeping their options open as a battle over the long-term military budget goes on. They have said they would need about 24 fighters to replace their ageing Soviet made MiG-21s to be more compatible with NATO, but at more than $20 million per fighter, new western planes are too pricey. It was not yet clear whether the aircraft in the U.S. offer would be used or new, and the Prague spokesman for McDonnell Douglas was not immediately available for further comment. ""Supply and service costs will be the subject of further discussions,"" the statement said. Czech pilots could begin training in the planes in six months, with delivery of the aircraft 18 months after the contract is signed, the statement said. To strengthen its bid, McDonnell Douglas also said that it is preparing to locate production of components for the Hornet at Czech light jet maker Aero Vodochody a.s. ""regardless of whether new or leased aircraft are chosen to re-equip the Czech Air Force"". Cooperation could also include Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s., it added. ","AlanCrosby"

"Czech railway unions said on Monday they would begin a nationwide strike at midnight demanding a complete overhaul of the decrepit rail system, and adding to growing unrest among public sector workers. The planned 48-hour strike, seeking a long-term plan to revive the failing state railways, is expected to completely shut passenger and freight traffic on domestic and international lines throughout the Czech Republic. ""We certainly will strike from midnight,"" the executive secretary of the Association of Unions of Rail Workers (OSZ), Zdenek Jilek, told Reuters. In a statement, the OSZ said that if it did not get sufficient guarantees to repair what it says are massive problems in the quality and development of the state railways Ceske Drahy, it would prolong the strike. ""It will be repeated every 24 hours,"" the OSZ said. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus was quoted by the CTK news agency as saying on Monday that a new development plan for the railways had already been negotiated with union leaders, and the unions were simply impatient for a result. ""If they could not hold on until when we meet again, and they call a strike, then they are taking a great risk in front of 10 million people of this country,"" he was quoted as saying. The action comes on top of an alternating ""chain"" strike started last week by teachers and school workers who are forcing the closure each day of selected primary and secondary schools throughout the country. The school strikes, for pay increases and more state expenditure on teaching resources, are alternating each day among various districts. There have also been persistent threats of industrial action by doctors and health-care workers, especially at large state clinics and hospitals which have fallen into insolvency. The centre-right coalition government has resisted giving into public sector demands which might threaten its fiscally-hawkish reputation. The country posted its first state budget deficit in 1996, at just over a billion crowns, after three straight years with a budget surplus. The rail union leaders said that their action carries no demands for pay increases, but is rather to clean up what it says are ""massive problems"" in the leadership of Ceske Drahy and the transport policy of the Czech government. They said that the condition of the rail system was ""critical"" and problems were deepening, and that the government had not fulfilled its own decisions to improve and consolidate the railways. The OSZ represents all Czech rail workers, which total more than 100,000 employess, excluding train drivers who have yet to say whether they will support the action. It is not expected that the railways would function even if the drivers do not strike. Losses of Ceske Drahy, one of the few companies not yet privatised by the post-Communist government, have been mounting. CTK quoted Ceske Drahy officials as saying the company expected losses of about seven billion crowns in 1997 after a six billion crown loss last year, and four billion in 1995. In June 1995, the rail unions were hours away from a strike over the planned privatisation of Ceske Drahy, when the government agreed not to execute its plan at the time to restructure the loss-making railways. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JohnMastrini"
"U.S. retailers are expected to post sales gains in the single digits for March, bolstered by low-end discount stores sales while department store performance was nearly flat compared with a year ago. ""It appears there's a slowdown in the department store end of the business, but the discounters are still doing well,"" Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said. Overall, he expects comparable-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be up about 5 percent or slightly less. An early Easter could depress sales at stores that were closed on the holiday, which fell in the March selling period instead of April this year. Winter storms in much of the northern part of the nation may have also held sales back.

Tuesday reported a 3.7 percent decline in comparable-store sales at its JCPenney stores in March. The early report was due to a debt offering the company is making this week. The loss of one day's sales because of Easter hurt sales, J.C. Penney said. Penney's decline is expected to be mirrored by other department stores, analysts said. ""Most (department store) chains saw flat or even slightly lower comparable sales during the March period, as they compared with healthy year-ago increases,"" analysts at Montgomery Securities wrote in a research report. They added that the early Easter and snowstorms in the Northeast added to pressure on sales. At the same time, discount stores are expected to post 4 percent to 6 percent sales gains, with low-end discounters reporting low double-digit gains, Montgomery said. ""We continue to believe the low-end strata is benefitting from the fruits of a fully-employed economy and the direct pay-hike from the 1996 minimum wage increase,"" Montgomery's analysts wrote. Among the major chains, analysts see Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, reporting same-store sales gains of about 7 percent. Sears, Roebuck and Co. was expected to report gains of 2 percent to 3 percent, with Kmart Corp. up 10 percent to 12 percent. Kmart's results are expected to be driven by seasonal items, such as horticulture, home goods and bicycles. But it will give back some of those gains in April because of the calendar shift, analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a research note. Kmart stores were open on Easter, analysts added. Dayton Hudson Corp. is expected to post a 1 percent to 2 percent gain, with a 3 percent to 4 percent increase at its Target discount stores offsetting flat department store sales. Federated Department Stores Inc. is expected to post flat sales, with some planned promotions moved into April, analysts said. ","BradDorfman"
"McDonald's Corp. has turned up the heat in the fast-food business. If franchisees go along with the plan, the world's largest restaurant chain will launch its biggest nationwide promotion ever, featuring 55-cent sandwiches, down from about $1.95 for a Big Mac, according to franchisee sources. The plan is a bold step to lure customers into McDonald's restaurants in the face of intense competition in the nation's $100 billion fast-food business, industry analysts said. McDonald's, which has more than 20,000 units worldwide and more than 12,000 in the United States, declined to give specifics on its plan. Spokesman Jack Daly said the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company hopes to launch a ""national value-price promotion."" Pointing to a current promotion on Chicken McNugget sandwiches, which analysts said has helped McDonald's build sales this month, Daly said, ""It's in that same spirit."" Charles Gonzales, a McDonald's franchisee with two units in the San Francisco area, said the nationwide promotion would feature a different sandwich for 55 cents each month when a customer buys french fries and a drink at the regular price. The promotion, he added, is expected to start with the Big Mac hamburger, which is usually priced between $1.90 and $1.99, and will include breakfast sandwiches as well, he said. But the promotion, to be presented to franchisees on Thursday, could spark a price war, analysts said. That prospect worried investors who drove fast-food stocks sharply lower. ""Everyone will have something for 55 cents. Now it's a zero-sum game again,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok. But Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said Wendy's International Inc. and Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, may not match McDonald's price promotions right away. ""There are a lot of things (companies can do) to enhance value without directly cutting prices,"" Adelman said, including increasing the frequency of regular promotions. Burger King said it had no plans to change its prices. Wendy's officials also said they won't cut prices in response to McDonald's plan. McDonald's stock tumbled $2.625 to $44.625 and Wendy's slid $1.50 to $20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares were among the most active issues. American shares of Britain's Grand Metropolitan Plc, which owns Burger King, fell $1 to $30.625, also on the NYSE. Dean Witter's Adelman said it remained to be seen if the McDonald's plan will bring in more customers. ""We have much more jaded consumers today,"" he said, noting price cuts were not ""new news."" Gonzales noted some franchisees oppose price promotions since they often do not boost customer traffic enough to offset lower sandwich prices. Moreover, regular customers may be tempted to order whatever sandwich is being offered that month instead of higher-priced menu items, he said. Daly, however, said increased sales volume is expected to offset lower menu prices. ""Margins (are) a function of volume,"" he added. Dick Adams, chairman of the Consortium, an independent association of McDonald's franchisees, said he expected the promotion plan to be approved. ""They (franchisees) are going to vote for it,"" Adams said. ""They are being told that it's the only plan that is available."" He said McDonald's was expected to present the plan in a satellite broadcast to operators across the country on Thursday. McDonald's has been looking to boost domestic sales, which have been pressured because of competition. In a December 1996 memo to owners and operators, Jack Greenberg, chairman of McDonald's U.S.A. said, ""We must re-energise and focus our U.S. marketing efforts and develop a national value proposition.""

"A battle is shaping up for control of Russia's Fuel and Energy Ministry after the minister resigned, and the losers are likely to be Western firms eyeing deals in the lucrative Russian oil sector, industry sources said on Monday. The Kremlin has not yet named a replacement for Pyotr Rodionov, who tendered his surprise resignation on Friday, leaving almost no record of substantial achievements after eight months in the job. But the sources said Moscow, abuzz with talk of possible replacements, was likely to install a person whose priority was domestic oil producers, not Western joint ventures or output-sharing deals dominated by energy multinationals. ""Rodionov didn't have any real feel for the oil sector,"" said one Western source. ""He wasn't a plus or a negative -- he was a nonentity."" Russian news agencies tipped Alexander Samusev, vice-president of Rosprom-YUKOS, Russia's second largest oil producer, and a former deputy minister in the Fuel and Energy and Finance Ministries, as the likely replacement. YUKOS and its shareholder, Bank Menatep, declined to comment. Rosprom is an industrial holding firm attached to Menatep. Sources said First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, a new cabinet reformist in charge of natural monopolies and energy issues, wanted his own unnamed choice in the post. Either option would install a candidate with market economy sensibilities but also a keen desire to make Russian oil firms the dominant players in the world's third biggest crude producer. ""Having somebody from Menatep run the energy ministry wouldn't be particularly good news for Western companies,"" said a European industry executive. ""I would expect him, if he gets the job, to take a tough line in terms of favouring Russian commercial banks."" Samusev, seen as a reformer and experienced in the state and private sectors, played a key role in winning oil export tax exemptions for joint ventures in the early years of reform. But that was years ago when domestic oil firms were just beginning to privatise and integrate with refining and marketing units and were in no shape to finance anything on their own. Russian companies now want controlling stakes in production sharing deals and are upset that they must pay taxes on some oil produced by ventures for which their partners are exempt. ""There is a concern that the Russian producers want to go it alone,"" said the Western source, adding that whoever headed the ministry could make terms tougher for Western oil companies. Samusev is a key link between YUKOS and Menatep in their stalled production-sharing talks with U.S.-based Amoco Corp on the $52 billion Priobsk field. The talks have faltered because the Russian side wants greater leverage and ownership in the deal. Rodionov, appointed in August 1996, was previously director of Lentransgaz, the St Petersburg-based transport unit of Russian natural gas monopoly Gazprom  GAZP.RTS. He left the oil sector entirely to his deputies, leaving Western oil firms -- which are ready to invest tens of billions of dollars if Moscow passes the necessary laws -- wondering whether Moscow had fundamentally changed its once more welcoming attitude towards outside participation in the energy sector. Western firms have long said they can secure the financing to reverse lower output, which has almost halved in the last 10 years and was 6.03 million barrels per day in 1996. But that may change now that Russia has a sovereign debt rating. ""It looks like Russian oil companies and banks are beginning to land financing that they couldn't have a year-ago,"" said the European source, adding that domestic commercial banks could be seeking to exert more leverage over the sector.

"The Czech industrial sector is ""really in weak shape"" with generally low profits and poor corporate leadership, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Czech team leader said on Wednesday. Speaking to an international banking forum Jiri Huebner of the London-based EBRD said return on equity among large Czech firms averaged just 3.5 percent last year, while the early months of 1997 have shown a sharp slowdown in output. ""Consequently a typical Czech company's profitability is so low that there are insufficient profits to pay dividends -- over 90 percent did not pay or declare any dividends,"" he said. ""Is the Czech industrial sector really in weak shape? I think it is."" Huebner said a key problem was debt loads of company owners -- mostly large domestic funds and holding firms -- carried over from leveraged buyouts used after the coupon-based privatisation scheme, and the ownership structure which has emerged. He quoted the EBRD's own study of fifty of the largest Czech companies which showed that the average level of debt leverage was about 43 percent of the total balance sheet -- and about 58 percent at engineering companies. This situation, coupled with uncertainty about poorly regulated capital markets, have combined to keep foreign equity investment at bay, he said. ""As a consequence, most industrial companies face internal cash constraints for financing new investments and for modernisation which are often needed to achieve a leap in productivity,"" Huebner said. ""Since coupon privatisation by its nature involved only a change of ownership, Czech companies had little resources to restructure."" Huebner said Czech managers must take strong initiatives to restructure firms since shareholders are proving ineffective. He called on managers to formulate their own long-term plans for investment since ""many owners do not behave like long-term strategic investors"" but instead massively practice transfer pricing and short-term speculation. ""In the absence of their own plans, most controlling shareholders will probably not block the managements' intiatives,"" Huebner said. ""All the enterprising and competent Czech managements should take advantage of this and fill in the prevailing vacuum of corporate governance."" Among the points Huebner prescribed to revitalise Czech industry, which posted a real contraction in output of 3.9 percent in January, the government should: * Adopt a tax system which allows wider writeoffs, rewarding rational decision making by mangement, and lowering punitive tax burdens. * More strictly enforce rules against transfer pricing between holdings, giving greater protection to minority shareholders, and increasing tax collection. * Encourage more equity expansions by firms by liberalising rights issues procedures and allowing management more freedom to initiate equity issues. * Split banks' investment activities so that corporate decisions do not conflict with lending interests. Also: * Banks should be more discriminating in financing leveraged buyouts. * Management must take a robust intiative to restructure. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003 ","JohnMastrini"
"NatWest Markets is expected to deal firmly with anyone found to have been responsible for its 50 million pound ($80.2 million) loss on interest rate options. Sackings, demotions and bonus cuts are among the penalties banking sources have suggested NatWest could hand down when it releases a preliminary report into the affair on Thursday. NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc, revealed the embarrassing hole in its interest rate options book nearly two weeks ago. A NatWest Markets spokeswoman declined to comment on the precise timing of the early findings of its internal probe, which have been widely expected to emerge this week. She said she could not comment on a newspaper report suggesting bonuses could be cut but confirmed the results of the inquiry ""may have a financial impact on certain individuals"". NatWest has hired accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines to assist it in finding out how the options ""mispricing errors"" went unnoticed for so long. Options are contracts which give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security at a set price on a set date in the future. A former NatWest trader, widely believed to be Kyriacos Papouis, has been reported by NatWest to British financial markets regulator the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA). And a senior NatWest trader, Neil Dodgson, has been suspended for allegedly ""failing to supervise"", pending the outcome of the probe. Dodgson, who has not spoken about the case, was not immediately available for comment. Papouis left NatWest in December last year for U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns. He resigned from Bear Stearns last week and has not commented on his role in the NatWest affair. There has been no suggestion there was any personal gain involved, but the affair has raised deep concerns about NatWest's internal risk management. Bear Stearns last week declined to give any details of the Papouis resignation, except to say it had conducted a thorough review of his open trading positions and was satisfied they were all booked and managed properly. Britain's SFA has been notified of the NatWest internal inquiry and has opened a file, while the Bank of England has said it is co-operating with SFA. On Tuesday the Bank of England, which supervises the NatWest group, said it was being kept informed of developments by NatWest. NatWest Markets said it was undertaking a thorough review of its control systems, both internal and external. Banking sources and British newspaper reports said this has involved examining the workings of both its interest rate derivatives department and its compliance division. Jean-Francois Nguyen is head of interest rate derivatives at NatWest Markets. At the time of the mispricing errors, he reported to the then head of debt capital markets Phil Wise. The Times on Thursday reported that NatWest's computer-based risk models had not been fed with accurate information which would have enabled any excessively risky positions to be identified. A key question likely to be asked of senior NatWest officials is why the firm did not reveal the loss when it announced its 1996 results only days before it made the surprise announcement. NatWest said it had brought the loss to the market's attention as soon as it came to light, but some banking sources questioned why the loss had not been picked up when the firm prepared its 1996 accounts.

"When thousands of auto dealers rolled into Las Vegas for their annual convention last year, there was much clamour over the looming onslaught of no-haggle superstores. As dealers prepare for this year's gathering, which starts Saturday in Atlanta, the juggernaught is upon them. Republic Industries Inc., the company controlled by billionaire investor Wayne Huizenga of Blockbuster Video fame, is on a buying spree that may have already made it the largest auto dealer group in the nation. Within two months, Republic, which includes the AutoNation USA superstore chain, has gone from owning no new-car franchises to six dealer groups. In the meantime, officials at CarMax, the auto superstore chain owned by Circuit City Stores Inc., said earlier this month they would consider buying existing dealerships and adding more new-car outlets as part of their expansion plans. ""I think it's got a lot of dealers rattled,"" said John Sinclair, owner of Sinclair Ford of Festus in Festus, Mo. The sweeping changes prompted industry trade magazine Automotive News to ask in its most recent edition: ""Apocalpyse Now?"" Before its latest purchase, Montgomery Securities estimated Republic's 1997 franchised dealership revenues at $2.5 billion. That puts it ahead of the previous largest group, Hendrick Automotive Group, which has estimated 1997 revenues of $2.4 billion. The explosive growth of Republic, CarMax and others comes as Detroit's Big Three automakers have backed off their traditional resistance to publicly owned dealerships. Ford Motor Co. Chairman Alex Trotman told dealers in Las Vegas a year ago that the No. 2 automaker had no plans to follow Chrysler Corp. and award a new car franchise to an auto superstore. But the automaker reversed its position in December when it formed an alliance with Republic that resulted in the sale of Ohio-based Mullinax Management, one of the country's biggest Ford dealers, to Republic. Ford Chief Financial Officer John Devine said earlier this week the automaker still believes the private enterprise system is the best for the industry. But he added, ""We also have to recognise that changes are here and more changes are going to come."" How profitable and successful the superstores ultimately become remains to be seen. But in the short term, they are helping turn the tradition-bound retail car industry upside down. Armed with capital, the auto superstores have taken sophisticated mass-market retail concepts honed in such places as consumer electronics stores and applied them to the new and used vehicle market. The results are huge lots of high-quality, pre-certified used cars. Buyers who dread walking into an old-fashioned car dealerships enter the new superstores to find user-friendly computer kiosks and childrens' play areas. Salaried sales representatives offer low-pressure help, vehicles at no-haggle prices and 30-day bumper-to-bumper warranties. ""I think there's going to be a revolution in the car business,"" Fred Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford in Columbus, Ohio, said earlier this month during a panel discussion at the Automotive News World Congress. Ricart, whose own dealership is structured in an auto mall format, believes traditional dealers can overcome their negative sterotypes and compete. But he says they have to find new ways of improving and measuring customer loyalty and satisfaction. ""The advantage the superstores have is they've got a clean slate going in,"" he said. The National Automobile Dealers Association's 80th Annual Convention and Equipment Exposition will be held at the Georgia World Congress in Atlanta, from Feb. 1-4. ","ToddNissen"
"Chinese interest in soymeal imports has tapered in the wake of a rally that has pushed prices above US$320 a tonne C&amp;F, traders said on Tuesday. ""There's no business above $300 (a tonne),"" a trader in Singapore said. ""Everyone is lurking at $300,"" said another trader in the region. ""If anyone is buying at $320, I want to find them."" Reports that China had bought Indian meal for September shipment at $323 a tonne, inclusive of cargo and freight, and further for November/December shipment at around $313 a tonne were greeted with ridicule throughout the region. Trading sources said China was staying out of the market, and that Indian meal was currently overvalued by a good $20 a tonne. Traders gave the market a couple of weeks before prices came back to more ""reasonable"" levels and the Chinese resume buying. ""The rally in India has been happening for the past couple of weeks and the market has just jumped up. Prior to that India was undervalued,"" another trader said. Chinese buying halted around two weeks ago, the traders said, and domestic prices had remained firm. Meal prices at Chinese ports were around 3,000 yuan ($361) a tonne, the Singapore trader said. Traders throughout the Far East have told Reuters they expect China to import between one million and 1.2 million tonnes of soymeal in 1996. One trader said last week that 600,000 tonnes of soymeal was expected to arrive in China by mid-September. Chinese demand for animal feed -- a principal component of which is soymeal -- was down by five to seven percent in the southern regions, a veteran trader in Hong Kong said. Another source, however, said this did not correlate with an apparent rise in Chinese meat production of 15 percent so far this year, or with the relative stability of domestic meal and corn prices. ""There is reasonable (feed) demand,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has yet to issue vegetable oil import quotas and licences -- though traders reported that permission was granted for three trading firms to bring in a total of 100,000 tonnes of liquid oil in mid-August. The veteran in Hong Kong said the wait for quotas was frustrating traders who knew China was still flush with vegetable oil -- some saying current stocks could last through to the end of 1996. ""The trading companies are long on oil, the state, Cofco (China National Cereals, oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp), the crushers -- everyone is long on oil,"" another trader said. ""Domestic oil prices are being forced up, and they are trying to clear heavy stocks,"" the Hong Kong source said. Soybean oil prices in northern China have been under some pressure recently -- movements reported by the National Grains and Oils Information Centre in Shanghai show a range since early August between 7,200 and 7,800 yuan per tonne. ""We are hoping that in a couple of months we will see some action as the stocks clear,"" the Hong Kong source said. Some traders were putting oil in bonded warehouses against the issue of the licences, which usually happens well before the end of August, he said. Customs figures reported from Beijing on Tuesday show total soyoil imports from January to July 1996 were 919,140 tonnes, with 188,626 tonnes in July alone, and 72.2 percent of the total from Brazil.

"The Canadian unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc bowed to Canadian pressure on Thursday and said it would resume sales of Cuban-made pajamas after consulting with legal advisers and government officials. On March 4, Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton said the government was investigating whether Wal-Mart Canada Inc broke any laws by removing the pajamas from its 136 stores on February 27. Wal-Mart Canada is wholly owned by the world's largest retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas. By refusing to sell the ""Puritan"" brand of men's cotton pajamas, Wal-Mart Canada could have violated Canada's Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act. The act penalizes companies in Canada for adhering to foreign legislation such as the U.S. Helms-Burton law that punishes firms for doing business with Communist-ruled Cuba. Nichole Bourget, spokeswoman for Eggleton, applauded the move. ""I think they made the right decision after realizing that ... what was important was that Canadian companies abide by Canadian laws, and I think that Wal-Mart decided to respect that principle,"" Bourget said. The maximum penalty for contravening the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act is C$1.5 million (US$1.1 million), Bourget said. Canada and Europe have protested bitterly against the Helms-Burton legislation, which allows Americans to file lawsuits in U.S. courts against foreigners deemed to have benefited from property confiscated by the Cuban government since the Communist revolution in 1959. Wal-Mart Canada, which said it pulled the pajamas because of a customer's complaint at a Winnipeg, Manitoba store, said its reversal ""reflects our commitment to meet the expectations of the Canadian marketplace."" Last weekend a group of 30 Winnipeg citizens gathered outside a store to protest the move to ban the pajamas by singing ""O Canada"", waving the Canadian flag and handing out leaflets. Each Wal-Mart store had carried about 100 pairs of the C$12.96 (US$9.53) pajamas, one of 80,000 items sold by the Canadian chain. ((Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100)) ","LydiaZajc"
"China's domestic A share markets will rise strongly in 1997 due to the improving national economy but the pyrotechnics of 1996 will not be repeated with Beijing insisting on steady development, analysts said on Tuesday. The official crackdown two weeks ago on rampant share speculation has made the markets much more wary, but there is still plenty of money in China looking to get into the country's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, they said. Bank deposits are continuing to surge at about 30 percent a year and the government has purposefully closed off many other investment channels in the past few months, they said. The government has also pledged to flood the share markets with new scrip to prevent the sort of volatile surges experienced in 1996. ""Company results for 1996 are expected to improve a great deal (over 1995) largely due to the recovering national economy and the two interest rates cuts over the past year,"" said a stock analyst with China Finance Trust and Investment Co. ""This will be a trigger for the A share indices to top the highest levels reached in 1996, sometime around the time listed firms post their annual reports in April 1997,"" he said. Shanghai's A share index hit a 1996 high of 1,313.917 points on December 12 and its Shenzhen counterpart a record of 502.77 points on the same day. Analysts said they believed share prices would not move as dramatically in 1997 as they did in 1996 with Beijing having made it clear it requires the markets to progress steadily. The central government said in April 1996 that it wanted to develop China's fledgling stock markets to make them a major means for Chinese companies to raise money, thereby relieving the debt burden on state-run banks. The statement sent Shanghai's A share index up more than 100 percent and Shenzhen's A share index up more than 300 percent in the months that followed. But in mid-December, Beijing launched a crackdown on the stock markets due to alarm over growing volatility and speculative trading, and share prices have since plunged around 30 percent. ""The crackdown has sent strong warnings to retail investors, preventing them from blindly rushing to the stock markets for quick profits,"" said an A share trader. ""This will prevent the markets from being so volatile again in 1996."" ""After the powerful correction triggered by the crackdown, prices of most shares are now closer to their real value,"" said a second trader. ""We believe the indices have about touched bottom which has laid the foundation for rises next year."" Analysts said liquidity for the markets would be ample in 1997, with China's individual bank deposits estimated to be 3.8 trillion yuan ($457.8 billion) at the end of 1996, against a total A share market capitalisation of around 1.2 trillion yuan. ""There are few investment channels,"" said a broker. ""As long as the markets are developing healthily, investors are likely to make the stock markets their choice."" Beijing recently announced a quota for new A share issues in 1997 and beyond of 10 billion shares, almost double the 5.5 billion share quota announced a year ago. The big increase was aimed squarely at stabilising the markets, analysts said. ($1=8.3 yuan) ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"Cocoa bean exports from Ivory Coast jumped to 171,104 tonnes in March, against 148,827 in February and 169,065 in March 1996, official shipping data show. March exports and bean quality were similar to last year's levels even though the 1996/97 crop is expected by pod counters to fall short of last year's 1.2 million tonne record, exporters said. ""Last year there was a demand peak earlier in the year but this year demand came later,"" said one shipper. ""March (1997) has been one of the biggest shipment months ever so we are looking hard at the (export) figures."" Abidjan handled 119,123 tonnes of March 1997 exports with a further 51,981 tonnes leaving via the second port of San Pedro. Cumulative exports for the first six months of 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) totalled 767,337 tonnes, against 722,646 by the end of March in 1995/96. ""The average bean count so far has been 101 (beans per 100 grams) so quality has been very good,"" said the exporter, adding that bean sizes last week averaged 100/100 grams. Ivory Coast's bean export standard is 105 beans per 100 grams with less than eight percent humidity. Some upcountry buyers have pointed to slipping bean sizes ahead of the mid-crop (May-Sept). The main destinations for March exports from Abidjan were broadly the same as last year. North-west European ports received 85,198 tonnes, with 60,812 for Amsterdam. U.S. east coast ports took 17,161, including 13,865 for New York. Separate figures by destination for San Pedro were not immediately available. Shipments from the two ports during the main January and March cocoa contract months totalled 166,268 tonnes and 171,104 tonnes, against 174,927 and 169,065 last year. Some shipments loaded in late February 1997 had probably been recorded as March exports, said one shipper. ""The (export) figure is very high for one month but bulk shipments might have put the volume up,"" he added. Ivory Coast produced a crop of 1.2 million tonnes in 1995/96 and private forecasts for 1996/97 range up to at least 1.15 million tonnes. Port arrivals stood at around 982,000 tonnes by mid-April as the main crop (Oct-April) tailed off, compared with 1.03 million tonnes in 1995/96, industry sources said this week. Analysts have made preliminary harvest estimates of up to 180,000 tonnes for the mid-crop (May-Sept), but steady rains needed into June will partly determine final volumes. Ivory Coast has not revised its 1996/97 total crop forecast of 950,000 tonnes, but U.K.-based broker GNI cut on Wednesday set its full year 1996/97 Ivory Coast cocoa crop estimate at 1.15 million tonnes.

"Intel Corp. on Wednesday will unveil its Pentium II microprocessor, a speedy computer chip that will help the world's biggest chip maker break into new markets and stave off rivals. The new chip is based on the Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro, but includes software and circuitry -- dubbed MMX technology -- that makes it more adept at handling graphics. In most cases, it works 30 percent to 40 percent faster than today's mainstream Intel products, analysts said. About a dozen personal computer makers will announce Wednesday they plan to use the chip in high-end machines, said Richard Dracott, Intel marketing manager. Most of the new Pentium II machines will be desktop PCs aimed at engineers and professionals who use a lot of computing horsepower for graphics, analysts said. Although the Pentium II is a souped-up version of the Pentium Pro, it is the biggest product introduction for Intel in years, said Mark Kirstein, research director at semiconductor market researcher In-Stat in Scottsdale, Ariz. ""The Pentium Pro was really a niche product"" for high-end desktops and servers, the computers that control networks, Kirstein said. ""The Pentium II is aimed at the mainstream."" A streamlined design and cheaper production will make it easier for Intel to churn out the new chip, Kirstein said. Within a year, most new PCs -- even the ones geared for home use -- will be based on the Pentium II, analysts said. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., also is trying to pitch the chip to new kinds of customers. The company has told video game makers, for example, that the chip can handle the intense graphics requirements of coin-operated arcade games. ""We will be delivering significant performance improvement over the fastest Pentium Pro,"" Dracott said. Intel said part of the performance improvement comes from a new so-called cartridge design. The Pentium II will be sold to PC manufacturers in a plastic housing that includes specialised memory chips. Because the microprocessor and memory chips are packed closely together on a seperate circuit board, they can pump data to the rest of the PC much faster, Intel said. There is one more benefit: It frustrates Intel rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp., which for the first time are a credible threat to Intel. AMD and Cyrix make chips that work like the Pentium and sell them to PC makers for much less. But their chips are designed to fit into the old slots for microprocessors. AMD spent the past two years working on the K6 chip, which works as fast as the Pentium Pro and is 25 percent cheaper, but does not fit into the new cartridge slot. Since most of the PC makers are expected to use Intel's cartridge design, AMD now has to spend time and money to make the K6 compatible. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported an unexpected first-quarter profit Monday, reflecting surprisingly strong computer chip sales. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company earned $12.95 million or 9 cents a share for the quarter ended March 30, compared with a profit of $25.3 million, or 18 cents, in the same quarter a year ago.

AMD said first-quarter revenue rose 1.4 percent to $552 million from $544.2 million a year ago. Revenue for the most recent quarter was about $10 million higher than Wall Street expected. ""The important message of the first quarter is that the company is profitable and that they are starting an incredible product cycle,"" said analyst Mark Edelstone, at brokerage Prudential Securities Inc. The results were announced after the market closed Monday. AMD shares had risen $1.875 to $41.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares rose an additional $1.75 to $43 in after-hours trading. AMD Chairman Jerry Sanders said all of the company's businesses improved over the fourth quarter, when AMD posted a loss of $21.2 million, or 15 cents a share. ""Recovering strength in all sectors of our business produced the sales growth necessary for AMD to return to modest profitability even before volume shipments of AMD-K6 MMX processors,"" Sanders said, referring to AMD's newest chip. ""Revenue growth was led by flash memories, Microsoft Windows compatible microprocessors, and programmable logic devices from our Vantis division."" Last week, AMD introduced the K6 chip, a microprocessor for standard personal computers that can handle basic calculations slightly faster than Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro chip. Based on expected demand for an alternative to Intel's pricey offerings and improving operations, AMD stock has doubled since the beginning of the year. Sanders said the company shipped only 10,000 K6 chips during the quarter. He said, however, that AMD plans to increase production substantially in the new few months. ""We are ramping production in order to ship hundreds of thousands of AMD-K6 MMX processors during the current quarter, and millions of units in the second half of 1997,"" Sanders said in a statement. In order to boost acceptance for its new chip, AMD is embarking on an aggressive marketing campaign, starting with TV commercials this week on the popular NBC sitcom ""Seinfeld"". Intel, the world's biggest maker of computer chips, has spent millions in the past three years on the ""Intel Inside"" campaign, even though Intel's chips are the brains of about 90 percent of the world's PCs. Before the K6, AMD's microprocessors had been at least three years behind Intel in computing horsepower. It did not have to counter Intel's marketing juggernaut because its customers mainly were second-tier PC makers that bought its chips for low-priced machines. Two years ago, the company gambled its financial future to make sure that the K6 was just as fast, or faster, than comparable Intel chips. The gamble paid off, at least technically. The K6 beats the Pentium Pro in most everyday applications, according to trade magazines. Not only that, AMD plans to sell it for at least 25 percent less than the Pentium. Armed with the K6, AMD now plans to chase Intel's best customers -- makers of high-end professional and consumer PCs. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Chinese authorities have imposed a curfew on a town in the mainly Moslem region of northwestern Xinjiang after at least 10 people were killed in a separatist riot last week, officials and local residents said on Monday. At least 10 people were killed and many wounded last Wednesday when 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining, smashing cars, burning shops and beating up Han Chinese to protest against Beijing rule. ""Both Han Chinese and Uighurs were killed or injured,"" a propaganda official said by telephone from Yining in the near the border with Kazakhstan. A Chinese source with close links to the government said the separatist riot was among the most violent for many years in Xinjiang, where Moslems are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up just 38 percent of the population. ""A circular has been issued and broadcast on television ordering people not to go out after dark,"" said one local resident, a Han Chinese. ""We don't go out after the sun sets. There is a curfew every night."" Local officials described the riot as a small incident fuelled by unidentified ""foreign hostile forces"" and refused to say how many people had been killed or injured. However, the Chinese source said at least 10 people had been killed, including one police officer, and many wounded and arrested. ""One police officer was stabbed to death,"" said the source, who declined to be further identified. The Hong Kong-based Ming Pao newspaper said rioters set fire to the bodies of those killed. About 100 were wounded, it said. The rioters attacked ethnic Han Chinese on sight, smashed cars and set fire to shops, forcing local authorities to send out about 1,000 police and paramilitary People's Armed Police to quell the riot, one Han resident said. ""They said they wanted the Han out of Xinjiang,"" he said. The riot erupted after a Chinese policeman tried to arrest a man of the ethnic Uighur minority, the Chinese source said. ""The police tried to arrest a Uighur criminal suspect but the suspect and his family resisted arrest,"" the source told Reuters by telephone. ""The scene attracted neighbours and onlookers and the crowd swelled to more than 1,000 and turned into rioting,"" he said. ""The police were called in and fired teargas to dispel the crowd."" The demonstrators, shouting anti-Chinese slogans, had marched on a government building and police had asked them to disperse, said the propaganda official in Yining, about 700 km (440 miles) northwest of the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi. ""There was a demonstration and they shouted slogans calling for Han Chinese to be driven out of Xinjiang and for Xinjiang to be split from the motherland,"" he said, adding that the rioters had ""used the pretext of religion"". The festival to mark the end of Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting, fell at the weekend, overlapping with China's celebration of the biggest holiday in its calendar, the lunar new year, last Friday. Xinjiang, considered by many Chinese a wild frontier territory, has a long history of ethnic clashes between the native population of mainly Moslem ethnic minorities and the ruling Han Chinese.

"Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said on Thursday that a long-awaited Czech-German post-World War Two reconciliation treaty would not bring any change to laws which expelled millions of ethnic Germans. Zieleniec told reporters he welcomed German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's statement on Wednesday that he hoped the sensitive document closing the book on the Nazi occupation of Czech lands and its aftermath would be signed by year's end. But Zieleniec said there would be no tinkering with Prague's post-war laws which expelled and expropriated over 2.5 million ethnic Germans, known as Sudeten Germans, after the Czech lands were liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945. ""I want to say something clearly: the declaration will not at all mean not even a hint of a change of the Czech legal order,"" said Zieleniec. ""I am glad Mr. Chancellor spoke on this issue, it is a sign Czech-German relations are an important part of German political activity at present, and that these relations are in the focus of Germany's key politicians,"" he added. Intensive bilateral talks on the declaration, now running for more than a year, have been held amid calls by politically powerful groups repesenting the expelled Germans for compensation from Prague. The Czech government has given symbolic compensation to Czech victims of Nazi occupation, but the Bonn government has yet to offer compensation to the Czechs similar to payments made to victims of Nazism in other European countries. The expelled Germans' groups, concentrated in southern Germany, have demanded the abolition of the post-war decrees issued by then-Czechoslovak President Edvard Benes. Attempts to cancel the decrees by some individuals through Czech courts have failed. Kohl pleaded for patience in his address to the Bundestag on Wednesday: ""We want to conclude this agreement this year,"" he said, adding that he wanted it to be symbolically crowned by a speech in Bonn by a representative of the Czech government. After a meeting with ministers on Thursday Czech President Vaclav Havel, who has spearheaded Prague's warming of relations with Bonn despite holding a mostly ceremonial position, said he agreed with Kohl. ""There's nothing left but to say that it is good that Mr. Chancellor (Kohl) would like to have the declaration signed by the end of the year."" ","JanLopatka"
"When it comes to dollars and cents, Hong Kong is showing high confidence in its future -- and that is clearing some doubt on other fronts about the impact of China's takeover, according to political analysts. ""The high-performing economy here is underpinning confidence and social order,"" said Michael DeGolyer, political analyst at Hong Kong's Baptist University. With the handover to China 41 days away, Hong Kong's economy is transmitting nothing but positive news. The bellwether property market is booming. The territory's Hang Seng index of blue chip stocks is constantly reaching for record highs, spurred by optimism about improved access to China and recent debt rating upgrades from rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's. A current Reuters survey of the territory's top companies confirmed overwhelming business confidence about the future. Ordinary Hong Kong people are holding more and more of their financial assets in the local currency, a Credit Lyonnais survey revealed on Tuesday. A growing number of citizens are also sinking money into China-related stocks. The Credit Lyonnais survey also portrayed a growing divide between political and economic confidence, also highlighted by DeGolyer's research. While two-thirds of Hong Kong people are confident about the territory's political and economic future, only 40 percent were confident about its political future in isolation. This proves the importance of a stable and prosperous economy to Hong Kong's future, DeGolyer said. ""The economy continuing to perform well is absolutely vital in making the transition a success. If the economy goes down the tubes, it will take political and social order with it."" A key factor undermining political confidence is future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa's plans to roll back some civil liberties. China argues that the legal changes simply return Hong Kong to the status quo before democratic changes initiated by departing colonial governor Chris Patten. Planned changes requiring police permission for protest rallies and banning foreign funding for political groups are no more severe than those in most Western nations, Tung has said. But Western governments object to changes in the context of China's pledge to allow Hong Kong to continue its own way of life for 50 years. Given the political uncertainties, DeGolyer said it is crucial that Hong Kong's incoming administration ensures that the economy functions well. Hong Kong had only to look at nearby Macau to see how important it is that the economy not be placed at risk. With China already established as its sovereign, Macau is still administered by the Portuguese, but it has serious problems of crime and social disorder with increasingly frequent shoot-outs and killings. ""If the (Hong Kong) economy is messed up, if there are failures in the economy and rises in corruption like we see in Macau, then we will have the same kind of problems Macau is having right now,"" DeGolyer said.

"The death of Deng Xiaoping is unlikely to shake the so-called Shanghai Gang of technocrats allied to President Jiang Zemin, analysts said on Friday. They said the group could rely on Jiang's continued patronage, in part because of the talent of its members. ""Shanghai is a pretty important place, therefore you'd expect people who have made it up to a certain level there to move on up,"" said a Western diplomat. Shanghai, China's biggest city and its economic heart, represents the success of Deng's forward-looking policy of integrating the country's economy with the rest of the world. The city attracts a major share of China's foreign investment and many analysts see Shanghai moving to regain its 1930s mantle as Asia's most important financial and cultural centre. Most high-profile of the Shanghai's stars are economic tsar, vice-premier Zhu Rongji and fellow vice-premier Wu Bangguo. Political pundits in the city are looking for signs of who will be the next to join the club of former Shanghai officials to heed Jiang's call to join him in Beijing. Officials say privately that both Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi and local Communist Party chief Huang Ju are heading for senior posts in the capital later this year. One official said he expected Huang to be given a role in the party discipline area while Xu would take a job dealing with the economy. Current vice-mayor Chen Liangyu is seen as the most likely successor to the mayor, while analysts in Shanghai lean towards the view that Huang will be replaced by someone from outside Shanghai. The central government wants to keep a steady rotation of officials from different regions to prevent the local administration becoming too independent, analysts said. Past and recent movements of senior Communist Party officials from Shanghai to senior posts in the central government have long been viewed as attempts by President Jiang to tighten his grip on power. But many of those in the loosely knit group are not Shanghai natives. Jiang, for instance, was not born in Shanghai, though he cut his political teeth here. ""The people he is going to feel most comfortable having around him are the people he worked with,"" said an analyst. But their abilities in the task of running a modern government are probably even more valuable, the analysts said. Shanghainese are perceived as competent administrators and canny business people. ""The Shanghainese do have a reputation for being very skillful at administration and business,"" said a Shanghai-based diplomat. ""And that's where China is right now -- they need competant people, people with management experience. And the management experience in Shanghai is one which is needed in the centre,"" he said. The move late last year to Beijing of Shanghai's vice mayor in charge of the economy Hua Jianming fitted into this pattern, analysts said. Hua was widely respected for his management and administrative skills, said an Asian diplomat, ""and he was brought into the centre to use those skills"". ""The Shanghainese clique are simply very expeditious at implementing other people's vision because, essentially, they are technocrats and that's what China needs,"" said a Western analyst.

"Leading cruise ship operators looking to repeat their success at home by exporting some of American culture abroad will have to tailor their sea-going holidays to local markets and tastes. Industry executives at an international trade convention said that Europe and Asia could be promising markets for Carnival Corp., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and others in the flourishing North American leisure cruise business, which barely existed three decades ago. ""The major North American lines are well positioned to grow internationally, as long as they acknowledge the major cultural and business differences,"" P&amp;O/Princess Cruises Chairman Tim Harris said during a panel discussion last week. North American cruises lines, offering trips to the Caribbean and along the West Coast of the United States to Alaska, are enjoying strong domestic business. Bookings at Carnival Cruise Lines, the main unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp., are up 37 percent in the three months through last Monday while shipboard berths rose only 13 percent, Canrival Cruise Lines President Robert Dickinson said. Still another sign of the sector's health in the United States is that Walt Disney Co. will next year make its seawater debut by offering cartoon-themed cruises aboard two new ships from Port Canaveral in central Florida. The industry is on a ship-building spree, with the just-launched Carnival Destiny capable of carrying 2,600 passengers while Royal Caribbean is building new ships that can carry 3,100 apiece. But the customers are overwhelmingly from the United States and Canada and the offerings are unmistakably American -- whether aboard mass-marketer Carnival, which describes its increasingly gigantic vessels as fun ships, or other lines catering to richer tastes. That is not all bad, the executives said, but more offerings tailored to national and regional tastes will likely be required in Asia and Europe. ""The right ships have to go to the right places with the right food,"" said Celebrity Cruises Inc. President Richard Sasso. Celebrity is an Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. affiliate. Both Carnival, the industry leader with almost 27 percent of all cruise berths, and number two Royal Caribbean are already active overseas and employ different strategies. Royal Caribbean competes in Europe but does little beyond hiring multilingual crews to adapt the onboard accomodations, food and entertainment from those it offers on seven-day trips from Miami, company chairman Richard Fain said. ""Our ships offer an American experience in Europe, not a European experience,"" Fain said. The European tours are aimed mostly at Americans. ""We are carrying more Europeans in the Caribbean than in Europe,"" Fain said. Carnival, which expects to carry more than 1 million passengers in 1997, is taking a multi-pronged approach by acquiring the Italian cruise operator Costa and buying into British tour group Airtours Plc. Carnival also has a joint venture with Hyundai Group of Korea to provide cruise holidays in Asia. ""Those three strategies were deployed to offer products in those markets for people in those markets,"" Dickinson said. Harris of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. affiliate P&amp;O/Princess Lines said business arrangements must also be fitted to foreign markets. Kirk Lanterman, chairman of Carnival affiliate Holland America Line-Westour, said the overseas cruise markets were already substantial. He said about 3 million people each year take cruises on small lines offering national or ""ethnic"" foods, entertainment and accommodations and about 500,000 non-Americans travelled on the lines operating from south Florida and elsewhere in North America. Lanterman also warned his peers against diluting the character of their popular lines. ""It's very difficult to make these ships different for non-Americans without making it unsatisfactory for Americans,"" Lanterman said. ","MichaelConnor"
"Chinese Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin has wooed Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties to come up with constructive suggestions on reunification of the two sides, split by civil war almost five decades ago. ""We welcome Taiwan's various political parties...to exchange views with us on relations between the two sides and on constructive suggestions about peaceful reunification,"" Jiang told a government advisory body on New Year's Day. Chinese newspapers carried the full text of Jiang's speech on Thursday. Earlier this week, Jiang made a similar overture, but he made no mention of the island's political parties, instead referring to Taiwanese from all walks of life. Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, which fled into exile on the island after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, says it is committed to reunification but is in no hurry to do so. Taiwan insists on reunification under freedom and democracy and a free market economy. The island's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party has called for ""self-determination"", or letting Taiwan's residents decide for themselves whether to reunify or declare independence. China, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province, has threatened to invade if the island declares independence. ""Taiwan is our country's sacred territory,"" Jiang said. ""We hope the Taiwanese authorities...will stop all activities splitting the motherland and take realistic action to improve relations between the two sides,"" he said. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei began to ease in the late 1980s, but relations plunged after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a trip to the United States in a bid to break the island out of diplomatic isolation imposed by China. Ties deteriorated further last March when China conducted war games and missile tests close to Taiwan in the run-up to the island's historic presidential elections. China frowns on Western-style democracy. Analysts said Jiang was eager for reunification to secure his place in modern Chinese history alongside Mao Zedong, who established the People's Republic, and Deng Xiaoping, who cemented the return of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in mid-1997. Jiang, the anointed successor of Deng, China's 92-year-old paramount leader, is seen by some Western analysts as merely a transitional figure and he has struggled to shake off that image. Jiang's call on Taiwan to come up with suggestions on ways to reunify could go unanswered again, one Chinese analyst said. China has been bitter since Taiwan ignored Jiang's 1995 ""eight point"" proposal on reunification, in which he called for leaders of the two sides to exchange visits. Jiang was seen by some in the military and the Communist Party as weak after his earlier call for reunification fell on deaf ears, analysts said. His latest overture to Taiwan could backfire and be used by his political opponents to attack him, another analyst said. ","BenjaminKangLim"
"Federal-Mogul Corp., dropping its four-year effort to build a global auto parts retail empire, unveiled a massive restructuring Thursday that returns it to its core manufacturing and distribution business. The Southfield, Mich.-based company said it took a total of $264 million in pre-tax charges to cover the restructuring and special one-time items from the fourth quarter. Federal-Mogul, which has about $2 billion in annual sales, also said it will slash about 2,900 jobs, equal to 18.5 percent of its worldwide work force of 15,700. The charges resulted in a net loss of $220.2 million for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $49.1 million for the 1995 period. For all of 1996, the company lost $211.1 million, but would have posted a profit of $34.7 million before special items. In 1995 the company lost $9.7 million. ""We have realigned our growth strategy behind our core competencies of engineering, manufacturing and distribution,"" Chairman Dick Snell said in a statement. ""Our retail operations are good viable businesses that can be operated better by someone else."" The company makes a wide variety of products, ranging from engine bearings, oil seals and pistons to lighting and electrical components, for the auto, farm and construction vehicle industry. Federal Mogul stock closed up 87.5 cents at $24.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Snell, the former CEO of Tenneco Inc.'s automotive business, joined Federal-Mogul in early November. He earned high praise from analysts Thursday for his swift action and straightforward explantion of where the company is headed. ""This is the kind of stock where if the numbers work out, the stock is going to work out, because people want to like him,"" said Salomon Brothers analyst Darren Kimball. Nicholas Colas, an analyst at CS First Boston, said the restructuring makes sense because the firm tried to expand in an area where it had no in-house retail expertise. ""Basically, the grand vision of having an international third world distribution and retail business is gone,"" he said. ""This is much more playing to the company's historical strengths."" Included in the restructuring is the planned sale of 132 international retail operations in Australia, Chile, Ecuador, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Africa, and Venezuela, and the planned sale or restructuring of about 30 wholesale operations in 10 countries. The firm also plans to relocate product lines in its European manufacturing operations and cut the work force; consolidate lighting products in Juarez, Mexico; and close a manufacturing facility in Indiana. The company also plans to close two distribution warehouses in Kentucky, consolidate customer support functions in the United States and streamline administration and operational staff functions worldwide. The moves are a complete reversal of the efforts by former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Gormley, who was forced to resign in September after pressure from the board. Snell said in an interview that future restructuring in North America and Europe are likely, which could result in more job losses over the next few years, although not on the scale of Thursday's announcement. At the same time, the firm will be on the lookout for acquisitions that could add to its core businesses, he said. For instance, since Federal-Mogul makes engine bearings, it makes sense for it also to offer pistons, Snell said. ","ToddNissen"
"The Anglo-Swedish consortium which makes the Gripen supersonic fighter aircraft said on Thursday that it could provide the Czech Republic with new planes for 40 percent less than any offered by its American competitors. British Aerospace Plc and Sweden's Saab said their package offered to the Czechs, who are looking to upgrade a fleet of ageing Soviet-made aircraft, includes guaranteed financing, low-cost leasing, and possible equity participation in Czech aircraft makers. Alan Garwood, British Aerospace's director for North America and Europe told a news conference the package would allow the Czechs to buy new Gripens for much less than any new or used aircraft offered by American makers. ""We believe the life-cycle cost of the Gripen is incredibly competitive, and the Americans cannot compete,"" he said, adding that there would be hidden costs inherent in the upkeep of used U.S. aircraft. Officials declined to specify the cost-per-piece the Gripen joint venture would actually offer to the Czechs. In cooperation with McDonnell Douglas Corp, the U.S. Navy last month offered the Czechs seven used surplus F/A-18 ""Hornet"" fighters in a no-cost, five-year agreement as a sweetener for a long-term deal. The offer also includes supplying, at cost, replacement parts, pilot and ground personnel, training and equipment. U.S. Lockheed Martin Corp has said it would have its own lower-cost offer to the Czechs for its flagship F-16. New advanced fighters are typically $20 million and higher, depending on communications, avionics and weapons systems. Czech defence officials have said they have the will but not the wallet to buy brand new Western-made advanced fighters, but are keeping their options open as a battle over the long-term military budget goes on. They have said they would need about 24 fighters to replace their ageing Soviet made MiG-21s to be more compatible with NATO, but they have said new western planes are too pricey. But Garwood said that the Gripen's basic lower price, a low-cost lease, and a guaranteed financial package backed by the Swedish and British government's with low interest rates, would ensure tremendous savings for the Czechs. ""Every day (the Czechs) delay, the American aircraft are getting older,"" Garwood said. The Gripen consortium has been considering participating in a tender for a 34-percent stake in the debt-ridden Czech light jet maker Aero Vodochody a.s.. Officials said a decision would be made in the next 7-10 days on whether to enter the bidding. Garwood said that although the Czech government did not explicitly create a direct link between equity participation in Aero and the selection of new fighter aircraft, Garwood said the government has made it clear that there would be a ""strategic"" link with Aero's new owners. Gripen officials said that development of Aero's L-159 trainer aircraft would fit well with the consortium's strategy, but did not rule out remaining in the race to supply the aircraft if they decided not too seek the Aero stake. Garwood said that the consortium was also in talks over offset agreements which would create production of some of the components domestically for Gripens provided to the Czech army. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JohnMastrini"
"Deng Xiaoping's most daring attempt at reform of China was also among his most dismal failures -- politics. It was an omission that will haunt his successors. His anointed heir, Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin, will also almost certainly inherit a power struggle in a country where political structures have yet to fully enshrine the handover of power. Deng, who died late on Wednesday aged 92, had raised the prospect of democracy, ensuring tens of millions of peasants have the right to elect local representatives. But he failed to build a structure that would solve the centuries-old problem of how an emperor could hand down power after he passed from the scene. Deng regarded political reform, complemented by economic invigoration, as crucial to the survival of Communist Party rule. ""In essence the purpose of political restructuring is to overcome bureaucratism, develop socialist democracy and stimulate the initiative of the people and of the grass-roots units,"" Deng told a Japanese visitor in September 1986. The main aims he emphasised after he gained power in late 1978 were separation of party and government roles, rejuvenation of the leadership and re-establishment of party democracy. ""For Deng, democracy is a way of making the communist party state more efficient,"" wrote David Goodman in ""Deng Xiaoping."" He never envisaged a system of universal suffrage and was therefore forced to crush those who went too far by demanding Western-style democracy and finally to settle for superficial reform that would not allow any threat to party supremacy. His combination of rapid economic reform alongside gradual political change saved China's Communist Party from the fate of its Soviet cousin -- where rapid political reform toppled a regime that did not press ahead on the economic front. He ended up creating a system in which the party held sway as a virtual parasite to a parallel government, economic and social structure and where corruption and abuse of power flourished in the loopholes. Deng separated functions of party and government to stop the party interfering to replace government, to prevent over-concentration of authority in party and in individual hands and to end absence of responsibility in the bureaucracy. The party should guide, not govern, in Deng's view. By the time of his death, the government was responsible for administration, it was the executor of decisions on policy that were the prerogative of the party. Deng pulled no punches in injecting new blood into a party leadership riddled with ageing veterans after the upheaval of the 1966-76 radical Cultural Revolution. He battled stiff opposition to shunt elders into a temporary holding pen -- the Central Advisory Commission, which he was finally able to retire in 1993. To try to ensure an orderly succession, he set an example by stepping down from a string of public offices, abandoning all his positions by the end of 1989. But he was forced to appoint and then sack two heirs apparent. His third choice, Jiang Zemin -- also chosen by Deng personally to head the party -- survived until Deng's death, but with no orderly succession pattern yet in place to prevent the usually brutal and often bloody succession struggles that have followed the deaths of Chinese emperors for centuries. Encouragement of party-led democracy -- emphasis on the need to stimulate individual and group initiative -- was the third plank in his political reform programme. ""In the final analysis, all our other reforms depend on the success of political reforms, because it is human beings who will -- or will not -- carry them out,"" Deng said in 1986. ""Without political reform, economic reform cannot succeed because the first obstacle to overcome is people's resistance."" Deng drew the line when the enthusiasm of the people for political reform became too extreme with open calls for democracy, and he sent the army to kill unarmed students who urged greater openness in the spring of 1989. He did allow limited democracy, with villages all over China empowered to elect district leaders from a pool of more than one candidate but free speech and publication of ideas and assembly were going too far. Those limits may influence a final judgment on his standing in Chinese history. ""In the annals of history there is only a small chapter devoted to those who advanced economic progress,"" wrote Lucian W. Pye in ""Deng Xiaoping: Portrait of a Chinese Statesman"". ""The big chapters are reserved for those leaders who brought political freedom and security to their people."" ","JaneMacartney"
"China is unlikely to need to buy rice on the international market to make up for flood damage to domestic crops, Far East traders said on Tuesday. No China inquiries for rice were reported by traders in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand. ""As far as large demand from the (central grain) reserve, COFCO (China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp) or the grain bureaux goes, I rule it out,"" said a Chinese trader in Shanghai.   China's Futures Herald newspaper, quoting State Grain Reserve Administration statistics, said on Saturday that although flood damage had reduced the early rice harvest and was likely to slow planting of late rice, total output for 1996 was expected to be unaffected. This is because China has increased the area under rice cultivation this year, the newspaper said, adding that the reduction in the early harvest should not have a significant effect on the total grain harvest due to higher production of other crops, it said.   Rice imports could not go ahead without central government approval, and the process of issuing quotas and licences could take weeks or even months, trading sources said. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said at the weekend that flooding in Hunan, one of China's major rice-growing provinces, had prevented farmers from planting rice for the autumn harvest and could force them to depend on food aid until next summer.   ""Many farmers lost the season's first crop of rice in the floods and were unable to plant for the second harvest, leaving them dependent on food aid until their next crop, in one year's time,"" said Thorir Gudmundsson. ""For the second crop, they need to plant in July, and it is now mid-August,"" he said. The notion that China might need to import rice to meet demand provided some underlying support to rice futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) on Monday. The CBOT September price closed up 5-1/2 U.S. cents per cwt at $10.16.   Chicago rice futures have been underpinned by a recent U.S. report that China bought 20,000 tonnes of Vietnamese white rice for prompt July shipments and that additional purchases were expected. But very little movement in domestic Chinese rice prices has been seen over the past three months, traders said. ""To be convinced that China will buy some rice, I have to get confirmation from the market -- but so far the market has not done anything, prices are steady,"" one Asian trader said.   Traders in China quoted domestic prices at 2,200-2,300 yuan ($265-$277) a tonne for low quality long grain rice; 2,600-2,700 yuan ($313-$325) for high quality long grain rice; up to 2,800 yuan ($337) for low quality short grain rice; and 3,000 yuan ($361) for high quality short grain rice. More than 500 people were killed by the July floods in Hunan alone, with the national death toll from floods and typhoons surpassing 2,700, according to the government. Applications for rice imports would have to traverse China's multi-layered bureaucracy, trading sources said, though the procedure could be speeded up in times of emergency.   The State Planning Commission (SPC) would issue a national quota, which would then be allocated to provincial SPC offices, which would then distribute the quota to trading companies, trading sources said. Rice, along with wheat, corn and soybeans, is considered a strategic grain and is thus tightly regulated. Hunan grows more than 22 percent of China's total early rice crop. Losses to the rice crop in the central province have been estimated at 2.4 million tonnes, accounting for most of the 2.6 million tonnes of Hunan's total grain losses.   About 90 percent of China's early rice crop of 50 million tonnes is grown in Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. China has three rice crops a year. A Chinese analyst predicted earlier this month that the flooding could cut early rice output by between 10 and 20 percent. This would reduce the total 1996 rice crop by up to four percent for a total output figure of about 180 million tonnes. China's rice production in 1995 was 179 million tonnes according to figures from the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp.   -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843-6470 ","LynneO'Donnell"

Pocket is one of several top bidders in the government's $10.2 billion auction that have come under pressure from the hefty interest payments required to pay for the ""personal communication services"" (PCS) licenses. The companies also have come under strain because of a reluctance on Wall Street to finance PCS ventures. Pocket is the first from the high-priced 1996 auction known to have filed for bankruptcy protection. The sale was reserved for small companies. Privately-held Pocket's big creditors include a group of Asian entrepreneurs and communications-equipment makers Siemens AG of Germany and L.M. Ericsson of Sweden. ""It enables the company to develop a plan to improve our financial health"" while continuing to build a wireless phone system, Pocket Chairman Daniel Riker said of the company's filing Monday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Pocket, based in Washington, said it would take ""several months"" to restructure its finances and business affairs before the company would emerge from the Chapter 11 process on firm financial footing. The Federal Communications Commission on Monday gave PCS companies from last year's auction some breathing space when it suspended indefinitely a March 31 deadline for them to make payments to the agency for their licenses. The FCC took the step while mulling a request from No. 1 bidder NextWave Telecom Inc., Pocket and seven other winners for permission to make the payments annually instead of quarterly. The bids have become loans from the government, with the winners paying interest on the money owed for the licenses. ""When you're out trying to raise capital, investors don't like to see their money go toward interest,"" said Kevin Inda, a Pocket vice president. The company's bankruptcy filing is expected to send a shudder through the ranks of the other auction winners who are trying to drum up money from wary investors. ""Pocket was a respected company that was considered to have put together a sensible plan,"" said Edward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine. ""It won't make financing more available."" ","RogerFillion"
"Legislation to dramatically relax U.S. export restrictions on computer encoding technology moved ahead on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee approved the measure. The bill, known as the Security and Freedom through Encryption Act, now goes to the House International Relations Committee where opponents plan to make their stand. Encryption, computer programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" has become an essential component of global communications and electronic commerce over the Internet. The Clinton administration has opposed the bill and similiar measures in the Senate, arguing that allowing strong encryption out of the country will put it in the hands of international criminals and terrorists. Representative Bob Goodlatte, the bill's author, said he had spoken to administration officials on Tuesday and hoped a compromise could be reached. ""We're very, very close in many areas,"" the Virginia Republican told reporters after the committee vote. ""The export control issue is probably the area that we're still the furthest apart on."" Goodlatte's bill would also write into law the current policy of allowing unrestricted domestic use of encryption. The bill would criminalize the use of encryption to conceal information related to the commission of a felony. That provision came on an amendment from Massachusetts Democrat Representative William Delahunt which replaced a broader criminalization provision included in the original bill. The committee also approved an amendment requiring law enforcement officials to compile statistics for Congress on the use of encryption by criminals. Software industry officials and privacy advocates, who have strongly opposed the export limits, urged lawmakers to continue moving the legislation forward. The International Relations Committee ""will have a go at it but it's great to have some momentum,"" Netscape Communications Corp. public policy counsel Peter Harter said after the vote. ""We've come a long way in a very short period of time. This legislation is moving at Internet time."" Jonah Seiger, communications director at the Centre for Democracy and Technology, said the vote was a ""historic moment."" ""The Judiciary Committee agreed that the administration has the wrong policy sending a very clear signal that we need to change direction,"" Seiger said. Before the vote, committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois prohibited amendments to the bill on the controversial export section. Hyde said the export section fell under the jurisdiction of the International Relations Committee. ","AaronPressman"
"Microsoft Corp on Monday plans to announce a version of its Windows 95 operating system for hand-held consumer devices that will be available this year, according to sources familiar with the company's plans. The Windows CE system for consumer electronics comes two years after Microsoft scuttled a similar project known as Winpad because its intensive memory requirements would have made the hardware too costly. Since then the explosive growth of the Internet has expanded the market possibilities for small wireless devices, while Microsoft rival Oracle Corp has popularised the concept of a $500 consumer device for accessing the Internet. Microsoft officials declined to comment, but the company said it would have an announcement on Monday on ""a significant addition in the area of Microsoft Windows platform software."" Microsoft executives previously had disclosed plans to supply a system for hand-held devices in time for the holiday season. The devices, ranging from a ""smart"" wireless telephone to personal organisers with communcations capabilities, will be marketed by eight computer and consumer electronics companies including Hewlett-Packard Co., Casio Computer Co. Ltd., and Philips Electronics NV, industry analysts said. The operating system will include stripped-down versions of Microsoft's Word and Excel applications and are likely to have some ability to get information off the Internet's World Wide Web. But with their tiny, monochrome screens, analysts believe they will be used at first largely for accessing electronic mail and personal information such as telephone numbers and appointments. ""The Web doesn't look good on a 4-inch screen,"" said analyst Mike McGuire of Dataquest. ""What this is about is Internet transactions and communications."" While hand-held ""personal digital assistants"" such as Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton have been available for several years the products have failed to grow beyond a niche category in part because of the difficulty of swapping information between them and desktop computers, analysts say. Microsoft aims to break that logjam with its new system, built for RISC microprocessors from Hitachi and others rather than the Intel Corp. processors used for most Windows-based computers. But at $500 -- or close to $1,000 for a machine fully loaded with communications accessories -- price will continue to be an obstacle, said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group, who said the ""sweet spot"" for small devices was about $300. ""I don't really think the market is going to really jump off in big number until next year,"" he said. McGuire of Dataquest estimated worldwide shipments of hand-held devices would rise to at least five million units a year by the end of the decade from the current one million. While that's still relatively small compared with a personal computer market of about 60 million units annually, Microsoft needs to protect its Windows franchise from any potential incursion, said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie. ""If you let someone else get that operating system, over time someone could start working that system upmarket,"" he said. ""Microsoft needs to be a player here."" Microsoft move into hand-held systems could pose a threat to U.S. Robotics Corp. and Britain's Psion Software Plc, two of the most successful marketers of proprietary hand-held products. The Windows CE system also could be licensed for use with a rival to Oracle's  Network Computer, analysts said. ","MartinWolk"
"Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday raided the country's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, in a dramatic sign of a widening probe into its part in payments to a client linked to racketeers. The late afternoon raid on Nomura headquarters in central Tokyo was by both prosecutors and officials of the nation's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC). The highly public raids, including tipoffs to the media that they were imminent, appeared to signal the Nomura incident could become a showcase as Japan seeks to clean up business practices and deregulate its economy. Coinciding with the headquarters raid, another 90 officials swooped on 10 other locations and for the first time formally spelled out in detail what they were investigating. Deputy chief prosecutor Kunihiro Matsuo told reporters the raids were to investigate a Nomura director's illegal payment of 38 million yen ($309,000) to a company run by a relative of a racketeer to avoid disruption of a Nomura annual meeting. Matsuo said the other raids included searches of the homes of the racketeer or ""sokaiya"" and the Nomura director involved in the scandal, Shimpei Matsuki. The scandal surfaced on March 6 and Matsuki and fellow director Nobutaka Fujikura resigned on March 10 after internal probes found they made discretionary deals banned under Japanese law and funnelled profits to a front company for the racketeer. Sokaiya, often linked to ""yakuza"" crime syndicates, extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called ""sokai"" in Japanese. Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down on March 14 to atone for the scandal. He became an adviser to the company, and chairman Masashi Suzuki took over his position while retaining the chairmanship. Nomura, one of the world's most powerful financial institutions, is involved in bond and share trading. It exerts a powerful influence on every business in the yen bond market and is also Japan's top foreign bond seller. The company has seen key foreign and domestic clients suspend business with it since the scandal broke. Nomura has been a key player in Japanese financial markets for most of this century, including underwriting firms such as Sony Corp, which were part of Japan's postwar economic miracle. In a scene akin to a Japanese film, 90 officials in business suits, led by a man with a briefcase, marched military-style through the front doors of Nomura's modernistic headquarters. They firmly locked the doors, shutting out journalists gathered for a raid designed to have maximum publicity value. Reports that the raids were imminent hit Nomura's share price, which ended the day down 20 yen (16 cents) at 1,440 ($11.70). But brokers said the impact of the news was limited as the market had expected such a development. ""What the market is more concerned about is any punitive measures which will be taken against the brokerage,"" said Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager. ""The punishment will probably have an effect on the firm's business and could have an impact on the whole brokerage industry as well,"" Ueki said. The investigation comes six years after Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients. Top executives at Nomura resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters. ($1=123 yen) ","FumikoFujisaki"
"The Australian government appointed stockbrokers on Thursday to manage the proposed sharemarket float of its telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp, which will be the nation's largest privatisation. The float is estimated to raise a minimum of A$8.0 billion (US$6.32 billion) -- and perhaps much more. Finance Minister John Fahey said he wanted the Telstra float, through the sale of a third of the government's 100-percent stake, to go through by the end of the year. ""I want it ready to go to the market this year, this calendar year,"" Fahey told reporters. ""But I am not saying it will,"" he said. He added it was unclear whether the float of other international telephone companies would affect the float timing. France Telecom and Italy's state-owned Stet are also planned for sale this year. Australian brokers J.B Were &amp; Son, U.S.-based CS First Boston and European based ABN AMRO/Rothschild had been appointed global co-ordinators for the float, Fahey said. He said J.B Were, Ord Minnett of Australia,  CS First Boston, U.S.-Australian consortium Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank, Daiwa of Japan, ABN AMRO/Rothschild and German owned Deutsche Morgan Grenfell were appointed joint lead managers. The float would not be underwritten in Australia, where 65 percent of the offer is to be sold. But the shares offered in the United States would be underwritten and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the minister said. Two percent of the offer is set aside for Telstra employees and foreign investors are entitled to 35 percent. Fahey would not comment on how much the government expects to raise from the partial sale of Telstra. ""I want to get optimum value for taxpayers of Australia,"" Fahey said. Australia's Liberal-National Party coalition government was elected just over a year ago promsing to sell one-third of Telstra, with A$1.0 billion of the sale proceeds going to set up an environment fund. The float of Telstra will far exceed other privatisations by the Australian government in recent years. The sale of Commonwealth Bank of Australia raised a total of A$8.0 billion, in two separate tranches, and the 1995 float of Qantas Airways Ltd raised A$1.45 billion. The announcement was a boon to Australia's stockbroking community whose Christmas bonuses will be swelled by the Telstra float. The bidding for the Telstra deal was contested by 30 broking firms, which were invited to lodge proposals. However any of the appointed brokers for the managment of the Telstra float would be barred from managing the proposed float of rival telecom group Optus Communications Pty Ltd as it would be a conflict of interest, Fahey said. ""They will not be able to take part in other transactions which the Commonwealth (government) considers to be a conflict of interest and that includes taking part in a public offer of some other telecommunications group,"" Fahey said. Optus plans a share market float later this year, but the float is held up by court action. (A$1 =US$.79) ","KevinMorrison"
"National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators were preparing to examine the wreckage on Friday of a Delta Comair plane that crashed in a snowstorm on Thursday, killing all 29 people on board. The commuter plane, an Embraer Brasilia 120 en route to Detroit from Cincinnati, crashed in Raisinville Township about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Detroit. NTSB officials arrived in Michigan on Thursday and immediately set up a command post in Ann Arbor, which is near the site of the crash. The wreckage was brought together under a tarpaulin to protect it from snow and was being guarded until the probe began. Investigators met early on Friday to plan strategy for the probe and were expected to begin combing the mangled wreckage later in the day. Cincinnati-based Comair, an independent carrier that flies commuter routes for Delta, said the 30-seat plane was carrying 26 passengers and three crew members. The three Cincinnati-based crew members were Captain Dann Carlsen, First Officer Kenneth Reece and Flight Attendant Darinda Ogden, Comair said in a statement early on Friday. The airline sent 30 members of its emergency response team to Michigan on Thursday, according to David Siebenburgen, President of Comair. ""They are there to assist the families, the NTSB and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) in any way they can during this ordeal,"" Siebenburgen said. A news conference was scheduled by the airline for 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT)  at Cincinnati airport in Erlanger, Ky. Flight 3272 had been cleared for approach to Detroit Metropolitan Airport when air traffic controllers lost radar contact, Comair Senior Vice President of Marketing Charles Curran told a news briefing on Thursday. No distress signals were sent, he said. Comair said the plane has been with the company since February 1992 and had its most recent maintenance checkup on Nov. 20, 1996. The airline denied an earlier report the plane had been grounded two days earlier for rudder problems. Witnesses told local television crews the plane's engines made a sputtering sound before it crashed into the ground at a sharp angle. The plane exploded into a fireball that sent a black mushroom cloud into the air that left ""just pieces"" of the twin-prop airliner. The area and much of the region had been hit by a storm which dumped six inches (15 cm) or more of snow. While air traffic was snarled in Chicago and other cities there was no confirmation that weather played a role in the crash. In October 1994 icing caused a French-built American Eagle ATR-72 to crash in northern Indiana, killing all 68 on board. The plane's manufacturer later made revisions to de-icing equipment. CNN reported that the Brazilian-made Embraer-120 has been involved in 13 other crashes since 1986 where lives were lost, including an accident in Georgia that killed former Senator John Tower.

"MGM Grand Inc.  Wednesday announced a partnership with several prominent local civic and business leaders to build a casino in Detroit, joining a parade of high-profile suitors vying for three downtown gambling licenses. MGM Chairman Terrence Lanni said following a news conference here that total investment in the proposed casino complex would be more than $400 million. ""It could be more -- I would expect it to be more,"" Lanni said. Officials from MGM and the nine local partners, mostly African-American, refused to disclose details about the size and theme of their casino plans. They said it would be inappropriate to do so before an application is submitted and city leaders decide where the casino can be built. Michigan voters last November approved legislation that would grant three licenses for operating casinos in Detroit, making it the largest American city to have legalised gambling. Two local gambling groups that financed the pro-gambling lobbying efforts last fall are presumed to be in line for two of the licenses. Those companies are Greektown Casino LLC and Atwater Entertainment Inc. In addition to MGM Grand, casino operators that have expressed interest in Detroit include Harrahs Entertainment Inc., Mirage Resorts Inc. and Circus-Circus Enterprises Inc. Las Vegas-based MGM is known for its glitzy, entertainment-themed casinos, and Lanni made clear he envisions something similar for Detroit -- possibly involving a Motown theme. ""We're in the gaming entertainment business. We're competing for the entertainment dollar. Unless you have something that is very special, that is something people want to visit and re-visit, you're going to lose out to other entertainment venues,"" Lanni said. In addition to its reputation, Lanni boasted that MGM has the financial might to build a casino and possibly a hotel in Detroit. The company has received a commitment to boost its line of credit to $1 billion from $600 million. Lanni also stressed that MGM is a good corporate citizen that would help revitalise the lagging downtown Detroit area if its application was approved. But in an ironic twist, standing behind Lanni at the briefing was Alex Yemenidjian, MGM's president and chief operating officer. Yemenidjian, who said nothing at the press conference, was a key part of the hostile takeover attempt of Chrysler Corp. by MGM controlling shareholder Kirk Kerkorian in April 1995. Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. eventually abandoned his effort and signed a truce with Chrysler. Chrysler Vice Chairman Thomas Denomme was recently appointed chairman of the Michigan Gaming Control Board, the agency charged with licensing and regulating the new casinos. It was unclear how Denomme would handle his position when it comes to ruling on the MGM application. The local investment group is led by William Pickard, chairman of Regal Plastics Co. Other investors include Roy S. Roberts, general manager of General Motors Corp.'s Pontiac-GMC division; Anthony Grainer, president and CEO of Malan Realty Investors Inc.; and Dr. Arthur Johnson, retired Wayne State University vice president and vice chairman of New Detroit, Inc.

"China's President Jiang Zemin used his eulogy for Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday to hail the late leader's guidance in the recovery of Hong Kong and pledge peaceful reunification with Taiwan. Jiang told 10,000 Communist Party luminaries and other guests at the funeral rites for the late leader that Deng's great creation was the ""one country, two systems"" formula of allowing capitalist and socialist systems to coexist side by side in one country. ""The complete reunification of our motherland is the common aspiration of the entire Chinese nation,"" said Jiang, Deng's hand-picked successor, in a speech delivered at Beijing's Great Hall of the People and televised around the country. ""Using the formula of 'one country, two systems' to realise peaceful reunification is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great creation,"" he said. Deng guided the negotiations with Britain that eventually led to a 1984 accord under which the colony is to be returned to Chinese rule at midnight next June 30. Under that agreement, Beijing pledges to allow the colony to retain its capitalist system and a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years. The nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau reverts to China in 1999, leaving Nationalist Chinese-ruled Taiwan as the last territory Beijing must recover to achieve its dream of reunification. Deng died last Wednesday before seeing the recovery of any of these territories but Jiang said the Communist Party should carry out the late leader's mission. ""We must act in accordance with the teachings of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, striving to attain the objective of the motherland's reunification,"" Jiang said, speaking in front of a huge portrait of Deng draped in black ribbons and surrounded by bouquets of flowers. ""In accordance with the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese agreements, Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the motherland soon and Macao will return to the embrace of the motherland in 1999,"" he said. ""The Taiwan question will be settled eventually and the complete reunification of the motherland will certainly be achieved,"" he said confidently. Among the invited guests in the cavernous auditorium were supporters of Beijing from Hong Kong and Macau, most of them prominent businessmen, as well as Tung Chee-hwa who has been chosen to take over as Hong Kong's chief executive on July 1. Despite its pledge of autonomy for Hong Kong, Beijing has already decided to scrap some civil liberties and replace the territory's elected legislature with an appointed one after the transfer of power. That has raised concerns in Hong Kong as well as the United States and Britain. Taiwan, which has been separated from China since the end of a civil war in 1949, says it too wants to reunify with the mainland but under very different terms than those offered by Beijing.

"The Prague Stock Exchange's 1997 bull run, as expected, ground to a halt on Thursday as investors took profits, and analysts predicted little change in the bourse's fortunes over the short-term. The PX50 index, which has shot up over 16 percent since trading began this year to a two-year high on Tuesday of 629.0, retreated 9.0 points, or 1.43 percent, at the bourse's daily price fixing to 618.6. Leading the bourse lower were losses to its three biggest issues -- SPT Telecom, CEZ and Komercni Banka -- each of which fell more than 2.2 percent at the fix. ""It's a very thin market and when you see a little profit-taking like we are, the market kind of collapses,"" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. ""I am afraid that the trend will probably continue."" Analysts said they expected Komercni to be hardest hit of the blue chips, after rising more than 600 crowns, or over 25 percent, since the start of the year. They added that SPT, which has gained over 500 crowns, or more than 12 percent, in 1997, also looks expensive at current levels. ""The blue chips should cool off now and pull the market a bit lower, but they will not fall completely out of favour since they are the only shares on the market that are liquid enough to buy or sell when you want,"" said one local trader. After a disappointing 1996 which saw the PSE underperform its rivals in Budapest and Warsaw, the Prague bourse has been revitalised this year as foreign investors begin to return to a market they once abandoned because it was too ""murky"". But Czech authorities, seeking to improve the tarnished image of the country's capital markets, are taking steps to increase transparency and boost investor confidence. The Central Securities Registry (SCP) began from February 4 to publish, with one day's delay, the price and other information about each stock trade it registers. The SCP is where some 60 percent of share transactions are executed. The Prague Stock Exchange's governing chamber has also agreed to publish the prices of off-market trades conducted by its members from March 3. And, as a first step towards setting up an independent securities commission, the Finance Ministry's markets supervision department has been transformed into a Bureau for the Control of Securities with an 11-strong advisory board, including market players. The moves appear to be working with many investors finding it time to stop neglecting the market by adding Czech weight to their investment portfolios. ""We are seeing a lot of new money coming into the country and a lot of investors buying. I think this will continue,"" said Dan Gladis of Atlantik Financi Trhy. ""I don't think the correction will be that deep because of this and after a period of stabilisation we should see the market rise again,"" he added. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","AlanCrosby"
"An investigation by Japan's securities watchdog into possibly illegal deals at Nomura Securities Co Ltd is unlikely to be concluded quickly, a government source said on Tuesday. The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) has been investigating since last September and the probe is now centred on whether and how Nomura provided profits to a corporate customer, the source told Reuters. The source said the investigation is likely to take at least a few more weeks, and urged Nomura to cooperate fully.   ""To complete the investigation as soon as possible, extraordinary cooperation is needed from Nomura,"" he said, adding that until recently Nomura was not as cooperative as the authorities might have hoped. Under the Securities and Exchange Law, the SESC could advise the finance minister to hand down administrative punishment if it finds evidence of illegal activity. The heaviest penalty would be revocation of brokerage licences and suspension of business for up to six months. Under the law, the SESC could also pass the case to prosecutors to pursue legal action.   Nomura said last week that two of its directors made deals suspected to be ""discretionary"" transactions, meaning they were done without the client's knowledge, and moved profits raised from Nomura's own funds into a corporate client's account, practices banned under Japan's securities law. Media reports have linked the firm with a former ""sokaiya"" racketeer. Nomura Securities has said it could not confirm the media reports that the corporate client was run by a relative of a ""sokaiya"". Sokaiya are people who extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting, or by offering to prevent a disruption of the proceedings. Japanese commercial law has prohibited paying off racketeers since 1982. A Nomura spokesman said the company did not know how long it would take for the SESC to complete its investigation. ""We must make utmost efforts to restore people's trust... But we are now at a halfway stage (as the SESC investigation has not yet finished),"" he said. He said two company executives involved in the irregular dealings scandal resigned as managing directors as of Monday, but said they would stay at the company to help its in-house investigation into the deals.   Industry sources said that the longer the SESC investigation lasts, the greater will be the damage to Nomura's business and reputation. An executive at a life insurance company said: ""I was very shocked at the news as Nomura, a leading company in Japan's securities industry, seems to have repeated its wrong-doing after similar scandals (in 1991)."" Several Japanese investment management companies have suspended business dealings with Nomura in light of the scandal. ""Such business suspensions will continue at least until the SESC completes its investigation and official actions are decided upon,"" the insurance executive said. ","FumikoFujisaki"
"China may need to adjust the mix of its treasury debt next year to ensure an active response from domestic institutions, analysts said on Friday. Finance ministry officials were meeting in Beijing on Friday to discuss bond market trends and the issue of China's debt mix could be a focus of the talks, the analysts said. ""There is too much of the non-tradeable type of debt,"" said a Shenzhen analyst. ""It is not really attractive to institutions or individual investors."" China is issuing about 250 billion yuan ($30.1 billion) of state debt this year -- most of it domestic. More than half of the total is for non-tradeable voucher or certificate type treasury debt. In return for their funds, investors receive a certificate that can be redeemed before maturity. But this type of debt is not listed on either of the nation's stock exchanges in Shanghai or Shenzhen and no active secondary trading exists. Last year, this non-tradeable type of debt accounted for only about one-tenth of total government debt issued, bond traders said. ""Last year the focus was on the secondary market,"" said a trader with J&amp;A Securities in Shenzhen. ""Most of the debt was tradeable on the nation's exchanges."" Other securities firms agreed the response so far this year had been less than enthusiastic. ""There is not that much interest in the (non-tradeable) offer this year,"" said an official at China Southern Securities. ""I am not very optimistic about the outcome."" A Finance Ministry official denied there were problems with the sales, which began on March 1. ""I am satisfied with the outcome so far,"" the official told Reuters. ""We have until October to complete the sales."" The bonds are offered through bank underwriting syndicates, and analysts said that if the banks have to keep too much of the debt on their own books, they are unlikely to be enthusiastic about next year's issue. The trend was particularly marked in southern China where economic development has outpaced the rest of the country, giving investors more types of investment vehicles to choose from. An official at the state-run Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Shenzhen branch described the response to the offer in the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong as poor. Some analysts said the problem lay elsewhere. ""The interest rate is the real problem,"" said Zhao Xiaoyun, an analyst at China Securities Co. Zhao said bond interest rates were unable to match the returns available on the stock market. Domestic A shares in Shanghai have gained 40 percent since the start of the year. The 1997 state offer includes two-, three- and five-year debt carrying interest of 8.64 percent, 9.18 percent and 10.17 percent. This is 0.72, 0.92 and 1.17 percentage points higher than the interest paid on bank time deposits of corresponding periods. In the recent past, interest on bonds has been 1.5 to two percentage points higher than equivalent bank rates. But analysts said China may not want to widen the spread between time deposits and bonds too much. The banks may underwrite the debt but they are not eager to see their deposits drawn away by higher interest bonds. That could mean the best option for the state is to issue debt that can be traded and attracts institutional investors. ","WilliamKazer"
"After 19 months of sometimes violent confrontations, six striking newspaper unions on Friday made an unconditional offer to return to work at Detroit's two major daily papers. Al Derey, head of the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions, said the action was not an act of surrender but a tactic to expose the papers to potentially huge financial losses if they do not agree to a fair contract. ""Our position is this strike has not ended. This is simply a new strategy to try to win a fair and decent contract from two corporate giants that don't have any souls,"" a visibly emotional Derey told a news conference. About 2,500 distribution, pressroom, newsroom and mailroom workers walked off their jobs at the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News in July 1995 after contract talks collapsed. The papers are editorially indepdendent and have separate owners but have been published under a joint operating agreement since 1989. Knight-Ridder Inc. owns the Free Press. The News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc.. A representative from Detroit Newspapers Inc, the joint operating agency, could not be reached for comment. The papers have published every day since the strike began, although early on they only published a single joint edition. More than 400 of the original strikers have cross picket lines. The papers have hired about 1,400 replacements. Since the start of the strike, which has often erupted in violent confrontations between supporters and private security guards, circulation at the papers has fallen 30 percent. Advertising revenues are down between 15 percent and 20 percent. Derey told reporters the advertising boycott has cost the papers a combined $250 million, and 700,000 readers have dropped subscriptions. But because the newspapers ""still don't get it,"" he said the unions need to adopt a new strategy. If the papers reject the return-to-work offer, they could be liable for back pay from the time the offer was made if they were found to have commited unfair labor practices, said Derey. That amounts to $250,000 a day, or $1 million a year, he said. The action Friday is a controversial one for many union members, who are staunchly opposed to returning to work. But Derey appealed for their support. ""This wasn't the only strategy and it isn't the easiest, but it is the best way we've got to take on these corporate powers and get us moving again down the road to a fair contract,"" he said. One local labor analyst said the union's move was an acknowledgement the strike as a means of leverage has reached the point of diminishing returns. But it does force management to make some difficult decisions. ""What the unions are doing now is upping the legal ante,"" said Steve Babson, labor program specialist at Wayne State University's Labor Studies Center. If the papers do not agree to take back all of the striking workers, they could be liable for the back pay penalities if they commited unfair labor practices, a legal process that could take years to resolve, he said. The Detroit regional director of the NLRB has accused the companies of unfair labor practices, finding they did not bargain in good faith. The company appealed that decision to an administrative law judge, who has not yet issued a ruling. ","ToddNissen"
"Britain's Woolwich Building Society, which will float on the stock exchange this summer, said on Wednesday its pretax profit rose by 18 percent to a record 392 million pounds ($629.5 million) in 1996.

While its net mortgage lending jumped 50 percent to 1.4 billion pounds, the society said its administrative expenses rose by less than one percent and its cost-to-income ratio edged down to 45.8 percent from 48.9 percent. Stewart said that if draft building societies legislation were passed in its current form, the Woolwich would have to consider expansion by acquisition very carefully. This is because in its current form the law would take away a building society's five-year immunity from takeover if it takes over another financial sector company. ""If the bill is passed in its present form, it would make us think twice about acquisitions,"" Stewart said. ""We would have to weigh the strategic importance of the acquisition against the loss of protection."" But Stewart added that, whatever the legislation, the Woolwich would be ""out there doing business"". The Woolwich had an excellent record not only in organic growth but also in joint ventures and cold starts. ""We have a lot more clubs in our bag, there are a lot more ways to develop the business if we have to think twice about making an acquisition,"" he said. The Woolwich, which will be quoted in the FTSE 100 index after flotation and is Britain's third largest building society, sees itself as a low-cost provider. Stewart said he wanted costs to get even lower. ""We think we're efficient, we've got a track record of reducing our cost-to-income ratio and we're not finished, by no means,"" he said. The Woolwich wanted to increase its business in areas such as unit trusts, life and general insurance and in the core mortgage business and personal loans. He said he especially wanted to see growth in its French and Italian companies -- Banque Woolwich and Banca Woolwich -- which he said were already doing well. Asked if Woolwich would grow organically in Europe, Stewart said, ""Oh no, it may well be by acquisition, if the right one comes along."" ","JoeOrtiz"
"Sequent Computer Systems Inc expects its revenue to increase at least 30 percent in 1997 on strong sales of its new NUMA-Q computer, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday. ""Our investors ought to be able to expect at least a 30-percent growth,"" said Casey Powell, Sequent chairman and chief executive.   Sequent specializes in making computers that pack dozens of inexpensive Intel Corp Pentium microprocessors - the same kind of chips found in personal computers -- into one box. By harnessing the power of a team of Pentiums, a Sequent machine has about the same horsepower as an International Business Machine Corp mainframe computer, the favored data-processing workhorse at big companies. Using clever software tricks and faster microprocessors, Sequent's new NUMA-Q line packs even more power in one box at a fraction of the cost of operating a mainframe, Powell said.   ""If what Sequent is saying is true, they are going to sell an awful lot of these systems,"" said Scott Butler, an analyst at Jensen Securities, a Portland, Ore., brokerage. There is already plenty of attention from customers. Companies such as Boeing Co, Unocal Corp, Ford Motor Co and the National Association of Securities Dealers have bought the machines, Powell said. A quarter of Sequent's fourth-quarter revenue of $183.2 million came from NUMA-Q sales, according to company. By the end of the year, almost all of Sequent's revenue will come from NUMA-Q sales, Powell said.   In 1996, Sequent had net income of $7.77 million, or $0.23 a share, on revenue of $595.4 million. Powell, the 52-year-old co-founder of the company, said he believes the new machines can help Sequent meet the rising demand for alternatives to the mainframe. ""There's an $178-billion base of installed mainframes out there,"" he said. ""About 12 percent of that market says, 'We are actively looking to get off the mainframe.'"" Even a sliver of the business from the mainframe defectors ""is a damn nice piece of business for me,"" Powell said.   To pursue new business, Sequent increased its sales staff by 50 percent last year -- part of the reason why 1996 net income plunged 78 percent from 1995. But Sequent is not the only vendor chasing the business. Last week, Sun Microsystems Inc, the $7-billion vendor of high-performance computers, unveiled Starfire, a machine that also uses dozens of microprocessors to rival a mainframe. Some analysts even said there is no big rush to dump mainframes.   ""This is a brand-new technology,"" said Jerry Sheridan, an analyst at market researcher Dataquest. To long-time customers of mainframes, ""this is going to be a hard sell in the near term."" Still, at least some investors are confident Sequent can lure customers. Sequent's stock has almost doubled in the past 12 months to about 18 on expectations of strong NUMA-Q sales. With much of the cost of NUMA-Q's development and the investment in an expanded sales force out of the way, net income will ""absolutely"" increase in 1997, Powell said.   Butler, who rates Sequent's stock as ""outperform,"" said prospects are good that the shares will keep rising in coming months. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Canada's French-language televised debate for the June 2 federal election was cut short suddenly on Tuesday when the moderator collapsed, leaving the five political party leaders stunned. Moderator Claire Lamarche, a television personality in French-speaking Quebec, fell out of her chair moaning about the heat in the room just as the five political party leaders were about to attack the key election issue of national unity. ""We decided together that the debate should not continue under the circumstances,"" Arnold Amber, one of organizers of the debate, said in a hastily arranged news conference. ""All the parties are in agreement with this."" The party leaders left without speaking to the media. Canadians had expected a lively debate on how to handle the troubling issue of Quebec independence. But the moderator's collapse made the abbreviated exchange anti-climactic, said political scientist Ken McRoberts at York University in Toronto. ""There might have been some dramatic moments in the exchange over the response to a (pro-sovereignty vote),"" McRoberts said in a phone interview from Toronto. ""So (separatist Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles) Duceppe must be quite frustrated."" Duceppe, a francophone, was sidelined in the English debate on Monday night but observers expected him to use the French-language debate to rally the separatist forces and gather support for his waning campaign. The debate was about two hours into its scheduled 2-1/2 hours when the moderator collapsed, just as Prime Minister Jean Chretien was asked if he would recognize a vote in favor of Quebec sovereignty if it were by a slim margin. In 1995, people in French-speaking Quebec voted 50.6 percent against Quebec separation, while 49.4 percent voted in favor of separation, prompting federalist forces to claim victory. But instead of exploring how the next government would handle an expected referendum on sovereignty next year, the debate focused on Canada's high unemployment rate, robbing Duceppe of the chance to stir up much nationalist spirit. ""You decreased the deficit on the backs of the poor,"" Duceppe accused the prime minister. But Chretien, much feistier in the French debate than in Monday night's English debate, fended off his competitors time and again, speaking about his party's economic record. Unemployment, especially among young Canadians ""is a very serious problem,"" Chretien said. ""However, first you have to have an economy which creates jobs, and this is the reason why we have to get rid of the deficit."" Under Chretien's Liberals, the budget deficit has been cut back from about C$42 billion (US$30.3 billion) in 1993 to a projected 1996 defecit of C$16 billion (US$11.5 billion). But Canada's unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly between nine and 10 percent for much of Liberals' term. Chretien, Duceppe and Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest -- the three francophone leaders -- spent much of the evening trying to show their parties had Quebec's best interests at heart. The two anglophone leaders -- Preston Manning, the leader of the right-wing Reform Party, and Alexa McDonough, who heads the left-leaning New Democratic Party -- were marginalized by their poor French. Over the two days of debates, Charest appears to have fared better than the other leaders. ""My sense is that Charest shone, as he did (Monday) night,"" McRoberts said. ""He is very articulate and very well prepared."" Charest's leadership has already translated into a surge in his popularity in Quebec. A recent poll indicated he was the most popular of federal party leaders in Quebec. The Progressive Conservatives have a long way to go, however. They currently hold only two of 295 seats in the House of Commons after being decimated in the last federal election. The Liberals have a huge lead in opinion polls, with the backing of between 42 and 47 percent of decided voters. ","HeatherScoffield"
"Deutsche Morgan Grenfell was unlikely to offer Nicola Horlick her job back, despite the former fund manager's continuing call for reinstatement, banking sources said. ""The ball's in her court,"" a banking source said late on Sunday, adding that Horlick's resignation last week meant that DMG's Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) was no longer obliged to discuss reinstatement with her. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell was preparing to launch an intensive campaign to shore up its pension fund business in the wake of Horlick's resignation at MGAM after she was suspended for allegedly trying to lure staff with her to another firm. The investment banking arm of Germany's mighty Deutsche Bank was to meet key clients, but DMG spokesman James Murray denied pension firms were considering moving from its 18 billion pound ($30.11 billion) funds. ""We've had absolutely no indication that our institutional pension fund clients have plans at this stage to move their business,"" he said. Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), the fund management arm of DMG, has already written to all its pension fund clients to limit any fall-out from the suspension and later resignation last week of senior British fund manager Horlick. Some clients, including London's Westminster City Council, Scotland's Dumfries and Galloway County Council and the Merchant Navy Officers' Pension Fund, have expressed individual concern about recent events at MGAM. And the Railway Pension Trustee Company, which has 1.25 billion pounds with MGAM, said it had met MGAM officials and would be in close contact with its asset managers. Meanwhile, Horlick continued to deny the allegations that she had tried to lure staff away from MGAM. ""I think my colleagues know that's not the case,"" she told BBC television as reporters swarmed around her on Sunday. Horlick was suspended from the firm only days after she had been promoted to managing director at MGAM. Her subsequent resignation as head of MGAM's British pension fund business and dramatic dash to Frankfurt on Friday to plead with Deutsche Bank for her reinstatement received widespread coverage in British media. ""These people who I spoke to in Germany were very, very serious about all of this. And I want to give them a chance to sort this out,"" Horlick said on BBC television. ""What I really want is a proper resolution. And I still think that that means either reinstatement -- and I mean that, I like doing my job. Reinstatement or compensation,"" she added. MGAM is still trying to regain an even keel after last year's revelations of irregularities at three of its retail investment funds, the sacking of fund manager Peter Young, a 180 million pound cash injection to bolster the funds and the announcement of a 200 million pound compensation package. Young, who denies any involvement in criminal activity, is now under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO). Much of the media coverage of Horlick's case has focused on the ""human interest"" angle with pictures of the 35-year-old -- dubbed Superwoman by British newspapers -- with her children at their luxury home in Kensington, west London. Fund management sources said Horlick, who stated she managed between three-and-a-half and four billion pounds worth of the firm's business, had talked about a management buy-out. But they said that even if this had been discussed informally it would have had no hope of success as DMG, along with many other firms, was keen to build its strength in this lucrative area and would not dismantle its business. Horlick, who during a whirlwind campaign on Friday entered MGAM's London headquarters in an attempt to meet management and loudly proclaimed ""Justice will be done"", has said she wants to settle her differences as quickly as possible and is pinning her hopes on further talks with a Deutsche legal official. She has said she plans legal action over what she claims was her ""constructive dismissal"" by the firm. But banking sources said it had not yet been served with any legal papers. Horlick's spokesman distanced her from reports a December lunch meeting had marked the start of talks with Dutch bank ABN AMRO on a move there. He said it had been a personal engagement and ""there was nothing culpable about meeting a friend...for lunch"". ABN AMRO has denied it tried to poach any MGAM staff.

"Boeing Co. said Monday first-quarter profit more than doubled and sales rose 70 percent as it ramped up airplane production, but the results disappointed Wall Street and the company's stock tumbled. Boeing said it earned $313 million, or 87 cents a share, in the quarter, excluding an accounting credit, compared with $119 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue soared to $7.32 billion from $4.29 billion. But Boeing's net income was 13 percent below the Wall Street consensus of $1 a share, according to First Call, and its stock fell $6.625 to close at $95.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most active issue. ""The stock is down because earnings came in quite a bit below the consensus. That's it in a nutshell,"" said Peter Jacobs, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. Analysts said Boeing's earnings were hurt by higher-than-expected expenses for new airplane models and other projects including a commercial space venture. The company also said it was incurring significant overtime costs as it increases production to meet rising demand and warned that profit margins would be under pressure for the rest of the year. ""It's sort of a wake-up call to some analysts who I think have been a little too optimistic about their margins,"" said analyst Bob Toomey of Piper Jaffray. Boeing said profit margins would be lower for the rest of the year because of a shift toward deliveries of the new 777 and next-generation 737 models. New models carry lower profit margins until the company has written down the costs of production equipment. At the annual shareholders meeting, Chairman Phil Condit said the two new models would account for half of Boeing's production next year, but he said the industry's fundamentals remained strong. ""I'm very optimistic about the upturn in our commercial airplane business as well as our prospects in defence and space,"" Condit said. ""We're excited about the future of this company."" Boeing delivered 68 commercial aircraft in the quarter, up from 40 in the year-earlier period when production was still hampered by the effects of a 10-week strike. For this year, Boeing reiterated that it expects to deliver 340 jets and generate revenue of $33 billion, compared with 218 jets and revenues of $22.7 billion last year. That includes former defence and space operations of Rockwell International Corp., absorbed in December, but not the planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp., which Boeing executives say will be completed in August, adding about $15 billion of annual revenue. Analysts expect Boeing production to continue rising in 1998 to about 450 jets as the world's biggest commercial planemaker works to meet surging industry demand. ""You expect that if you're ramping up rates there would be some costs incurred, and that's clearly what's happening,"" said Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities. But he said he was encouraged that Boeing still expects to meet its production target for the year. ""There always is a significant risk of running into some sort of shortfall, and all of a sudden you wind up with airplanes that ... are most of the way done and missing some critical parts,"" he said. That happened to Boeing in the late 1960s, when the company nearly went bankrupt, he said. This time around there is no such danger, as the company said it had $5.5 billion in cash at the end of the quarter, up slightly from three months early. Boeing's backlog rose to $89.2 billion from $87.7 billion three months earlier, chiefly because of new defence contracts. Boeing also recorded a $64 million accounting credit related to an employee-benefit trust fund. Boeing shares were also pressured by other factors, including a report in the London Times that Boeing rivals Lockheed Martin Corp. and Airbus Industrie were discussing a possible merger. An Airbus spokeswoman denied the report Monday but said the European consortium was in discussions with many aerospace companies, particularly about joining its proposed A3XX jumbo jet project. At the shareholders meeting, Condit reiterated that he was optimistic Boeing would complete its planned merger with McDonnell Douglas despite concerns raised by European Union authorities. A special meeting of Boeing shareholders to approve the merger has been set for July 25. ","MartinWolk"
"French conglomerate Generale des Eaux looked set to extend its power in the media industry after revealing on Monday it was in talks with Havas, primarily about pay-television company Canal Plus. ""Havas and Compagnie Generale des Eaux confirm discussions are now in progress concerning their respective interests in audiovisual activities, primarily Canal Plus,"" said a joint statement from Generale des Eaux and Havas. The announcement, which was rushed out before the stock exchange opened, followed press reports that the companies were preparing a deal which would make Generale des Eaux the key shareholder in Havas. That, in turn, would make the Havas media group the biggest shareholder in Canal Plus. The companies added in a joint statement that they would not comment further pending board meetings scheduled for February 6. The prospect of a major transformation of the French media landscape gained weight when a corporate source confirmed that Alcatel Alsthom was in talks about a possible sale of part of its 21.2 percent stake in Havas to Generale des Eaux. Generale des Eaux, already a powerful force in the water and telecommmunications industry, owns almost 20 percent of Canal Plus. The satellite broadcaster is itself merging with fellow-pay-TV group Nethold to create Europe's largest subscription television company. According to French newspapers, Generale des Eaux would transfer its Canal Plus stake into Havas, almost doubling Havas's current 21.6 percent stake in the broadcaster. Havas would then increase its own capital to allow Generale des Eaux a bigger stake. Other major shareholders in Canal Plus are the bank Societe Generale, with 4.5 percent, and the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations with 6.9 percent. Generale des Eaux would also become indirectly the biggest shareholder in the merged Canal Plus company. Havas would establish its direct dominance within Canal Plus, well ahead of Nethold's owners, Richemont and MIH, which have 15 and 4.9 percent repectively. Alcatel has owned 21.2 percent of Havas since selling its media business to Havas in 1995 in return for shares in Havas, which it was obliged to hold on to for at least two years. The initial market reaction was broadly positive. Havas shares soared and those of Generale jumped too. ""It's a good deal for all parties involved,"" one share dealer said. Alcatel stands to make a capital gain on the sale, as well as receiving cash, because the Havas share price has increased a lot over the past year, in line with a French stock market which is at record highs. Alcatel needs money to finance its planned acquisition, if the state permits it, of the government's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF. The government is due to announce its Thomson-CSF sale plans shortly, after scrapping its original privatisation plan in December. Newspapers have for months speculated about the Havas share structure, although Generale des Eaux has in the past denied plans to raise its stake. On the share market, Havas shares opened up eight percent but then gave in some of the gains to trade 5.3 percent up at 427 francs. Generale des Eaux was 0.7 percent up at 713, but Canal Plus was 0.93 percent lower at 1,171 and Alcatel slipped 0.55 percent to 545 francs. ","MarcelMichelson"
"Quaker Oats Co. Thursday reported a profit for the fourth quarter, reversing a year-ago loss, but said its Snapple beverage business was unprofitable and continued to be a disappointment. Quaker said Snapple's U.S. and Canadian sales dropped 8 percent in 1996, with volume down 11 percent. Sales of its six-flavor Diet Snapple line, however, rose 23 percent in 1996. Chicago-based Quaker said it earned $18.1 million, or 12 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $47.8 million, or 36 cents a share, in the 1995 period. Excluding a $40.8 million pretax restructuring charge in the 1995 fourth quarter, Quaker posted a year-ago operating loss 18 cents a share. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.06 billion, down 10 percent from $1.18 billion a year earlier, which included $90.3 million from divested businesses. For the full year, Quaker said it earned $244 million, or $1.80 a share, which included a $113.4 million gain on divested business. In 1995, it earned $720 million, or $5.39 per share, with a $1.05 billion gain. Sales last year were $5.20 billion, 13 percent below the previous year's $5.95 billion, which included $796.9 million from divested businesses. ""This was a rebound year in which our largest, value-driving businesses -- U.S. and Canadian foods and worldwide Gatorade -- increased their operating profits,"" Chairman William Smithburg said in a statement. A $100 million cutback in advertising and marketing costs in 1996 also helped results, analysts added. In a conference call, Smithburg said Quaker was committed to at least 10 percent real earnings growth in 1997. ""We're going to try like crazy to do even better than that,"" he said. Quaker management again pledged to turn around Snapple, which it bought over two years ago for $1.8 billion. ""We need to stabilize (Snapple's) volume"" in 1997, Smithburg said. ""Our goal is to operate Snapple at cash positive in 1997."" Cash positive means Snapple is expected to be profitable, excluding goodwill charges of about $50 million a year. Quaker surprised some analysts by not taking a charge in the fourth quarter to reduce Snapple's value. Analysts had expected Quaker to take a large writedown for Snapple, potentially as high as $1 billion. Smithburg declined to comment on speculation and rumors that Quaker was looking to sell Snapple, a fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business, and its Gatorade sports drink. He said Quaker's management continues to review steps to ""create value for shareholders,"" but declined to be specific. Gatorade, Quaker's largest brand, had a strong year in 1996, Smithburg said, with sales volume rising 6 percent in the fourth quarter and 4 percent year-to-date. Gatorade is launching this year a ""Frost"" line of Gatorade beverages that will feature a ""cooling taste,"" Smithburg said. ""The trade acceptance has been nothing short of terrific."" Smithburg said the company's hot cereals business had a strong year, with sales volume up 9 percent. Ready-to-eat cereals, such as Cap'n Crunch and Life, gained 3 percent in volume for 1996. The value-priced line of bagged cereals grew more than 40 percent in the year. Quaker stock was down 62.5 cents at $35.875 in afternoon trading. ","PatriciaCommins"
"AT&amp;T Corp's core businesses performed better in the last quarter of 1996 after struggling during much of the year, but a new problem of rising bad debts from business customers is causing analysts some concern. ""The growth in traffic volumes (3.2 percent) was better than the 2.5 percent we were expecting,"" said Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. ""But they are still losing market share to the tune of three percentage points a year,"" he said. An extra $200 million provision for uncollectible revenue dragged earnings below consensus for the fourth quarter. AT&amp;T's operating net was $0.76 against $0.68 in the year-earlier period and adrift of the $0.79 First Call consensus of analysts. Increased provisions will now cost $100 million each quarter. ""It knocks out close to four cents a share (in earnings) going forward,"" said Klugman. ""No one was expecting that,"" said Bette Massick, an analyst at Bear Stearns. The problem is partly poorer credit profiles at businesses, plus increased bankruptcies and bad debt. But breaches of contract and bankruptcies among the mushrooming number of long distance service resellers who use AT&amp;T's network is clearly a major problem too, analysts say. ""When a reseller goes out of business the network provider takes the hit,"" said Klugman. AT&amp;T and other network providers are required by Federal Communication Commission rules to do business with resellers, who then compete with them for customers. AT&amp;T said it had lowered customer turnover -- or churn -- and had maintained its market share in business services. ""Volumes in long distance was better and revenue growth better than we expected,"" said Massick. However she said she was lowering her earnings estimate for the company for 1997 to $3.20 from $3.65 per share. ""You have to cut your number for that (the uncollectibles) alone),"" she said. AT&amp;T seems to have overcome the worst of its problems in the credit card business where operating losses fell to $4 million in the fourth quarter from $35 million in the third quarter of 1994. ""At least it is not losing significant amounts of money any more,"" Klugman said. He added that the business was still very competitive and AT&amp;T, once a pioneer with no-fee cards, had lost its competitive edge. AT&amp;T shares took the results in their stride, falling 7/8 to 38-1/2 by mid-afternoon, against the backdrop of a sharp fall in the broad market. Chief Financial Officer Richard Miller said earlier that first quarter results would be comparable or slightly higher than those of the fourth quarter. The company said it must decide how much to spend on the entry into local telephone markets and how much to spend defending its long distance markets against the regional Bells as deregulation becomes a reality later in the year.

"French defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF, soon to be sold by the state, posted 1996 results on Wednesday showing a return to profit after three years of heavy losses. Thomson-CSF reported a net attributable profit of 745 million francs ($129 million) compared with a net loss of 791 million for 1995. Sales were up 2.2 percent at 36.27 billion. The return to the black was mainly due to the sale of Thomson-CSF's 19 percent stake in the troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais. ""Thomson-CSF has been able to return to a profitable footing, as the bank no longer weighs on the accounts of the company, which is now completely centred on defence electronics,"" chairman Marcel Roulet told an analysts' meeting. The state, after a bungled first attempt, is trying to privatise Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring which may have an impact on the entire European sector. Roulet said he expected the terms and conditions drawn up by the government on the privatisation would be published soon. ""It is a question of a few days or a week."" The Privatisation Commission has to vet the terms to allow the sale to go ahead. French engineering and telecommunications giant Alcatel Alsthom has teamed up with fighter-aircraft maker Dassault Aviation and state-owned Aerospatiale to bid for Thomson-CSF. Missiles-to-publishing group Lagardere is also bidding, supported by British Aerospace Plc (BAe). Thomson-CSF said in a statement that operating profit rose 5.6 percent to 2.07 billion francs despite a reduction in military budgets and tougher markets. The improvement was due to better competitiveness following restructuring efforts pursued over a number of years. The net result was dented by an exceptional charge of 824 million francs, compared with 753 million in the prior year, to cover restructuring costs tied to the shrinking of markets and cost-cutting measures, it said. Pre-tax pre-exceptional profit rose 12 percent to 2.04 billion francs, reflecting the productivity gains and lower financial charges. Financial costs fell to 27 million francs from 135 million, due to lower interest rates and favourable currency movements. Consolidated pretax profit was 1.30 billion francs, versus a loss of 437 million, which included a 101 million franc hit from its the sale of its holding in Credit Lyonnais. The previous three years' losses at Thomson-CSF were essentially due to falls in the value of Credit Lyonnais shares, which were taken on Thomson-CSF's accounts to reflect its equity stake. Europe, excluding France, contributed more than 10 billion francs in sales for the first time, compared with less than four billion in 1995. ""The European market accounts for 28 percent of the consolidated turnover, against only 10 percent at the end of the 1980s,"" it said, adding this was due to its policy of external growth through acquisitions. Its holding in profitable semiconductor maker SGS-Thomson contributed 588 million francs, up from 477 million in 1995. Net debt fell to 900 million from 2.3 billion. With an order book worth more than 67 billion francs at the end of 1996, the firm should see an increase in turnover over last year on a like-for-like basis, it said. Thomson-CSF stock closed up 1.55 percent at 196 francs, while the market was up 0.55 percent. ","PierreTran"
"Toronto stocks closed one percent higher on Tuesday, but trailed a stronger rally in New York as fears of a U.S. interest rate hike eased on weak U.S. inflation numbers. The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index soared 64.22 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 5743.55. On Monday, the index was down more than 10 percent since setting its lifetime high of 6348 points on March 11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 135.26 points to close at 6587.16.

Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a gain of 0.2 percent. The weaker numbers inspired investors to put aside fears of another U.S. rate move -- at least for a while, Ram said. Turnover was moderate with volume of 77.1 million shares worth C$1.35 billion ($966 million). Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 11 rose led by banks, conglomerates and utilities.

"Embattled Nomura Securities Co Ltd is expected to announce on Thursday the best results among more than 280 brokerages in Japan for the last business year, but prospects for the current year are gloomy. Analysts said on Monday that Nomura's profits for the fiscal year which ended on March 31 should be far ahead of its competitors thanks to huge profits in bond trading and bond underwriting. However, they added that business for Nomura in the 1997/98 year would be sharply undermined by a scandal, with the size of the expected profit drop depending on how hard the Finance Ministry comes down on Japan's largest brokerage after regulators complete their investigation. Japanese prosecutors and securities watchdog are investigating Nomura for suspected illegal deals involving ""sokaiya"" racketeers, who extort money from a company by threatening to disturb shareholders' meetings. In January, Nomura announced pre-tax, parent current profit of 103.69 billion yen ($829 million) for the first nine months of 1996/97, against 91.49 billion yen ($731 million) in actual current profit for the the full 1995/96 year. ""Nomura is expected to be the top in earnings in 1996/97 with profits of more than 100 billion yen ($800 million),"" said Ayako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd. Other analysts said they expect Nomura to post parent current profit -- pre-tax profit which includes gains and losses made on securities investments and other non-operating activities -- of between 120 billion ($952 million) and 140 billion yen ($1.11 billion). In the first nine months, Nomura posted 81.82 billion yen ($654 million) in stock brokering commission against 105.66 billion yen ($845 million) in 1995/96. Net gains on bond trading stood at 66.33 billion yen ($530 million) in the first nine months against 71.54 billion yen ($572 million). But industry sources said they would not be surprised if Nomura posts a loss in the current year because many institutional and corporate investors have suspended their business with Nomura since it revealed on March 6 that two of its directors were involved in the suspected illegal deals. Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it has held since February 1992. If Nomura's market share falls by 10 percent, it will lose 12 billion yen ($96 million) in commissions, analysts said. In addition, Nomura's underwriting business has also been hit by the scandal. The business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported last week that Nomura had underwritten only 2.5 percent of the domestic straight bonds issued so far in April, compared with 14 percent for all of the previous business year. Three other big brokerages -- Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, Nikko Securities Co Ltd  8603 T and Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd -- are also scheduled to announce their 1996/97 results later this month. Analysts estimate Yamaichi's parent current profit at nil in 1996/97 against profits of 15.13 billion yen ($121 million) in the profit in 1995/96, and Nikko to have profit of 40 billion yen ($320 million), down from a profit of 65 billion yen ($520 million). They expect Daiwa to post profit of 60 billion yen ($480 million), down slightly from 62.56 billion yen ($500 million). ","FumikoFujisaki"
"British property group Hammerson Plc's chief executive Ron Spinney said on Monday he expected the British market to perform well over the next two years. ""I think the market will perform well over the next two years,"" Spinney told Reuters. Earlier the group announced a 21.3 percent rise in pre-tax profit for 1996 to 70.0 million stg from 1995's 57.7 million stg. Net asset value (NAV) per share rose 3.2 percent to 388 pence from 376 pence.   Spinney said Hammerson had had ""another good year"", including turning over 15 percent of the portfolio, investing 50 million stg on improving existing properties and embarking on an 800 million stg development programme. He said the group would be spending around 115 million stg on its existing portfolio and its developments. ""We have taken steps to ensure growth in the future...The UK market for shopping centres and offices is bouyant,"" he added.   Spinney said there were signs the French market was in a similar position to where the British market had been about two years before, adding he was confident there had been rises in values since the end of the year in Britain. Hammerson's gearing is currently ""relatively modest"" at 58 percent, Spinney said, adding that the group itended acquiring more properties over the year, this would be split between areas and sectors. ""We are generally happy with it (the split) as it is at the present time,"" he said. ","AlexanderSmith"
"China hinted to Guatemala on Thursday that it should sever ties with Beijing's arch-rival Taiwan if it hoped to persuade Beijing to lift its U.N. veto on sending peacekeepers to the Central American nation. ""The attitude and position of the Chinese government is very flexible on this matter,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing. Asked about ongoing talks at the United Nations between China and Guatemala after Beijing exercised its veto in the Security Council last week to kill a U.N. plan to monitor disarmament and a ceasefire in Guatemala, Shen said Beijing's door was open. Shen lashed out at Guatemala's decision to invite Taiwan Foreign Minister John Chang to last month's peace signing ceremony in Guatemala City as a violation of the spirit and principles of the United Nations, but held out an olive branch. ""We still think the door to discussions between China and Guatemala is open,"" he said. ""We would like to hold talks with the Guatemala government at any time."" Shen stopped short of saying Beijing wanted Guatemala to break off diplomatic relations with Taiwan. ""The United Nations admits only one China, so if a country keeps so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan then it violates the spirit and principles of the U.N.,"" he said. ""Therefore the Guatemala government should make arrangements to respect the principles of the U.N.,"" he said. U.N. diplomats said China had requested the meeting with Guatemala in New York to try to repair the effects of its controversial veto that barred U.N. observers from monitoring a Guatemalan peace pact. The meeting was likely to continue on Thursday, diplomats said. The fact that China and Guatemala were talking despite a lack of diplomatic ties fuelled worries on Taiwan that Beijing might succeed in tempting Guatemala to follow South Africa's recent example and sever ties with Taipei in favour of Beijing. Shen was rather more direct. ""We hope the Guatemala government will take concrete actions to get rid of the obstruction and guarantee they will never support Taiwan either inside or outside the U.N.,"" he said. China is angry with Guatemala not only for recognising Taiwan but for joining a number of other small Latin American countries since 1993 to sponsor a General Assembly resolution aimed at securing U.N. membership for the Asian economic powerhouse. Shen urged Guatemala not to support what he called Taiwanese activities aimed at gaining independence for the island that Beijing has regarded as a renegade province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. It was the first time China had exercised its U.N. Security Council veto in nearly 24 years, and underlined its determination to try to force Taiwan into diplomatic isolation. Taipei on Thursday denounced Beijing for using its Security Council seat to squeeze Latin American states. ""We should altogether condemn communist China's acts of using its influence in the U.N. Security Council to interfere in the internal affairs of Central and South American countries,"" said Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Chen Yung-tso. Taiwan has given generous economic aid to several small, impoverished nations around the world in its bid to break out of a diplomatic isolation imposed by China. Taiwan was expelled from the United Nations in 1971 and replaced by Beijing as the rightful representative of China. China has never spelled out publicly what Guatemala was expected to do. But diplomats said it sought a pledge to refrain from sponsoring further pro-Taiwan U.N. resolutions and to stop receiving high-ranking Taiwanese visitors. ","JaneMacartney"
"U.S. lawmakers redrafting a legislative proposal to modernize U.S. banking laws will rely heavily on the Clinton administration's reform plan, congressional staffers said on Wednesday. But whatever provisions end up in the new draft, expected to be finished by Friday, the real battle will be fought when the House Banking Committee begins its formal consideration, or mark up, of the proposal currently scheduled for next week.   ""The goal here is to get in the (bill) those areas where there is general agreement,"" committee spokesman David Runkel said. ""The intent is to use as much of the Treasury (Department's) language as appropriate,"" Runkel said. The most controversial questions will be resolved as lawmakers offer varied amendments during the mark up, he added. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin unveiled the administration's plan to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws in a speech on May 21.   In testimony on Tuesday, Rubin urged Congress to scrap the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and free banks to enter other financial sectors like insurance and securities underwriting. At least four major areas of disagreement remain that will be the focus of the scheduled June 11 mark up, staffers said. Some lawmakers want the mark up delayed at least a week, however, so the session could be delayed. First, wide differences of opinion exist among legislators about whether financial firms should be allowed to engage in nonfinancial, commercial activities. The administration ducked the difficult question, offering two alternatives instead.   Three earlier bills also each took a different approach and numerous alternatives have been floated in recent weeks. ""You'll see it all at the mark up,"" one staffer predicted. Also, the insurance industry is up in arms about provisions in the administration plan that may broaden a 1996 Supreme Court decision limiting state regulation of bank insurance sales. The bill would allow federal bank regulators to overrule state insurance authorities in some instances. ""This could have the effect of threatening the safety and soundness of the nation's insurance system,"" said David Pratt, senior vice president of the American Insurance Association.   A third controversey sprouted from one of the administration's two ""alternatives"" on banking and commerce. The plan said Congress could allow limited mixing or keep the current prohibition while also maintaining the present exception allowing commercial companies to own thrifts. Under the second option, thrifts and banks would continue to operate under different federal charters. That outraged the banking industry, which thought it made a deal last year guaranteeing the charters would be merged.   ""A very critical piece if the puzzle will be that any financial reform measure specifically deals with the thrift charter issue,"" said Beth Climo, group director of financial industry affairs at the American Bankers Association. ""That is the fundamental thing that needs to be addressed,"" Climo said. Another area of disagreement surrounds proposals to allow creation of so-called wholesale financial institutions, or ""woofies."" These bank-like entities could only take deposits over $100,000 and would not receive deposit insurance. Some opponents of mixing banking and commerce fear that wholesale banks represent a significant loophole, since a commercial company could set up a ""woofie."" Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach said earlier this week that he hoped to have the committee approve a bill and send it to the House floor by July 4. But even if a majority of the banking panel can reach a consensus, the bill will be sequentially referred to the House Commerce Committee. That committee could then hold its own mark up or even stall the legislation. ((--Washington Newsroom 202-898-8312)) ","AaronPressman"
"An army of financial market regulators were poised on Sunday to descend on NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank, which on Friday announced a 50 million pound ($81.4 million) hole in its options trading book. The Securities and Futures Authority, which licenses options traders, and the Bank of England, which regulates banks generally, both said they would be working closely together to establish what had gone wrong at NatWest Markets. ""Supervisors work closely together and there is no doubt that we will talking about what has happened at NatWest,"" a Bank of England spokesman told Reuters. But the spokesman could not confirm a formal joint investigation with the SFA, reported in some newspapers on Sunday. The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates large fraud cases in Britain said it was not yet involved. ""We are not investigating the case, it has not been referred to us and it's not appropriate to speculate about whether it will be, "" an SFO spokesman said on Sunday. It also remained unclear on Sunday whether the operations of interest rate options trader, named by banking sources as Kyriacos Papouis, who now works for U.S. securities house Bear Stearns, included any element of fraudulent behaviour. ""At the moment, this looks like a trader trying to trade his way out of a loss,"" a banking source said, ""but it's not clear how or why, or how it took so long to discover."" A spokeswoman for NatWest Markets said the deals had taken place over a period of time in 1996 and had come to light only in the last few days. She confirmed the suspension of a senior options trader at NatWest Markets, named by sources as Neil Dodgson. A spokesman for Dodgson said he could not comment on the case but would be co-operating fully with any investigations. The case is sure to raise again the question of supervision of derivatives trading, especially as all City firms went through an apparently exhaustive review of their risk management control systems in the wake of the Barings collapse in 1995. Investment bank Barings collapsed under losses of 800 million pounds after rogue trader Nick Leeson embarked on a spree of unauthorised derivatives trading. While the current case does not compare in terms of scale and does seem to have been nipped in the bud, it will still cause major waves around the City. ""We are making a very thorough review of our control systems -- both internal and external,"" the NatWest Markets spokeswoman said. ""This is a business that requires constant scrutiny, you can never be complacent about the control procedures."" The question in the NatWest case is whether the ""mis-pricing"" of the options was done for personal gain or to hide the real position or was just hopelessly bad trading. NatWest is also likely to face criticism in the coming days over the suspicion that it already knew of the loss when it announced its 1996 results last week. NatWest has vigorously denied this, saying it brought the matter to light as soon as possible and has kept regulators fully informed. NatWest also said no client has been affected. Some sources said Natwest should perhaps have said no client has been ""adversely affected"" since the 50 million pounds must be showing up as a gain in a trading book somewhere.

"Lloyd's of London, beset by huge losses until 1993, is focused on its future and the needs of its clients after one of the most dramatic periods in its 300-year history, chairman Sir David Rowland said. In the insurance market's 1996 report and accounts published on Wednesday, Rowland said that Lloyd's had to continue to offer first-rate security to keep the confidence of its policyholders. It also had to ""strive to make its internal arrangements as transparent and equitable as possible"". ""The forces that shape the future must be the needs of our clients and our determination to preserve the unique marketplace, with its powerful attractions to clients and brokers alike, that is both our inheritance and the source of our future prosperity,"" said Rowland. The successful implementation of last year's reconstruction package and the settling of the ""great majority of the litigation that beset us"" had removed huge uncertainties, said Rowland. Huge losses run up between 1988 and 1993 threatened the future of the insurance market before the 'Reconstruction &amp; Renewal' (R&amp;R) plan was put in place last year. Since the completion of R&amp;R, the priority has shifted to debt collection and so far more than 1,300 writs have been issued against ""Names"" -- investors whose capital underpins the market. Lloyd's members who did not accept the R&amp;R settlement or did so without paying in full, still owe Lloyd's over 600 million pounds ($970 million). Whilst a significant amount of this is uncollectable Lloyd's was ""absolutely determined to recover as much debt as we can, in the shortest possible time"", said Ron Sandler the market's chief executive. The post-reconstruction solvency return showed a margin of total assets over total liabilities of 4.7 billion pounds, exceeding the statutory margin of solvency by more than five times. The Corporation of Lloyd's contributed 486.4 million pounds to the settlement. The Corporation's balance sheet shows a deficiency of 239 million pounds, reflecting a 292 liability connected with the settlement, offset by 53 million pounds of net assets. The creation of five new business units at the beginning of this year was designed to make the Corporation of Lloyd's more transparent and accountable to those whom it served and to promote more commercial pricing mechanisms and management disciplines, said Sandler. Progress in the implementation of the reorganisation had been encouraging and business plans for each were to be published shortly. ($ = 0.618 British Pounds) ","SimonCowell"
"The Canadian Auto Workers union's choice of Chrysler Corp as its strike target on Wednesday sets up a battle between General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co to take the lead in bargaining with the larger United Auto Workers. Currently, Ford appears to gaining an edge, analysts say. Detroit's No. 2 automaker, viewed as least likely to be named the UAW's target a few weeks ago, has recenly made offers that show a willingness to work with the union on the thorny issue of outsourcing, analysts say.   ""Ford is working hard to give the UAW a framework agreement,"" said Sean McAlinden, a labor analyst with the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. Now that the Canadian union has chosen Chrysler, it appears highly unlikely that UAW President Stephen Yokich will choose Chrysler as the U.S. target. Traditionally, the two unions have chosen different targets and threaten each with a national strike to push negotiations along. Pacts covering about 400,000 Big Three hourly workers in the United States and 53,000 in Canada expire on September 14.   McAlinden said Ford has offered the UAW some opportunities to move some parts manufacturing now done by outside suppliers back into Ford plants. That's the opposite of the task that GM is trying accomplish -- shifting more of its parts work to outside suppliers to bring down its burdensome cost structure. In addition, Ford earlier this year encouraged one of its suppliers, Johnson Controls Inc to allow some of its plants to be organized by the UAW -- a move that could help the union reverse declining membership rolls.   If Ford is chosen to negotiate the pattern agreement for the Big Three automakers in the United States, it could craft an agreement that would help meet its own needs, but that would hold back GM's cost-cutting progress. ""Ford may try to throw them a chicken bone to choke on,"" McAlinden said. Yokich last week opted to delay the union's choice of a target and analysts said he could let GM and Ford compete for a while longer to be named the target. In 1984, the union named the two automakers as ""dual targets"" and later negotiated the patern agreement with GM.   ""A dual target is certainly possible, but it's hard to focus on two places at once,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California-Berkeley. ""The UAW may just let it roll a bit longer and select the best offer sometime later."" Shaiken believes the Canadian Auto Workers' choice was probably dictated by the UAW's decision to eliminate Chrysler from consideration. CAW President Buzz Hargrove's decision to focus on Chrysler ""was a reluctant choice"" since he had spent much of the summer talking tough to GM. Some UAW leaders at individual Chrysler plants said they supported Yokich's apparent decision to focus on Ford or GM. ""I have full confidence that the UAW leadership is making the right decision,"" said Gary Kimbel, vice president of UAW Local 140 at Chrysler's Warren, Mich., truck plant. ","DavidLawder"
"China has jailed two Mongolians for up to 15 years on charges of separatism and espionage, the London-based human rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday. Hada, 41, former manager of the Mongolian Academic Bookshop, and Tegexi, 30, who worked in the Inner Mongolian Bureau of Foreign Affairs, were sentenced last December to 15 and 10 years in prison respectively, Amnesty said. Chinese courts rejected their appeals last month and upheld their original sentences, it said. The pair had been held for a year in solitary confinement without charges or a trial. ""No evidence has been made public to show that Hada and Tegexi were involved in any activity which may be regarded as criminal under international standards,"" Amnesty said. It called for their immediate and unconditional release. The Amnesty report could not be independently confirmed. Officials in China could not be reached for comment on the eve of Lunar New Year holidays. Amnesty said eight others were detained in December for alleged involvement in ""nationalist separatist"" activities, but were subsequently released. Inner Mongolia, a Chinese province, is populated mainly by ethnic Mongolians but there has been little sign of anti-Chinese unrest since the early years after the 1949 communist takeover and the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when dissent was crushed. However, in late 1995, authorities in Inner Mongolia arrested 12 people who had demanded more democracy and an autonomous region, according to human rights groups. Hada and Tegexi were being detained in poor conditions and their health was suffering, Amnesty said. They were living in a cell in Inner Mongolia's Number One Prison with over 30 other people, the report added. Hada has a recurrence of tuberculosis and his neck was swollen, the group said. It was not known if he had received any medical treatment in prison. Beijing-based Western analysts say China has tightened its grip on dissent and separatist sentiment ahead of the British colony of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule on July 1. ""The harsh sentences passed on Hada and Tegexi are indicative of the severe attitude taken during the past year by the Chinese authorities towards suspected nationalists in...Tibet and Xinjiang,"" Amnesty said. Inner Mongolia has traditionally been less restive than Tibet and Xinjiang. Tibet has been rocked in recent years by periodic unrest, which China blames on the Himalayan region's god-king, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India after an abortive uprising against communist rule in 1959. Xinjiang borders Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states. The region has been shaken in recent months by several clashes and political killings involving separatists who want to end communist rule in Xinjiang. ""This 'crackdown' has also affected those whose peaceful religious activities are deemed to threaten 'national unity' and 'social stability',"" Amnesty said. ","BenjaminKangLim"
"The Czech Republic has recorded its first budget deficit despite last ditch efforts by the government, which has staked its reputation on fiscal responsibility, to achieve a fourth consecutive surplus. The Finance Ministry said on Friday that definitive data showed the budget ending 1996 with a deficit of 1.56 billion Czech crowns ($57.28 million). Modest though the budget may be by Western standards, it was the first shortfall since the Czech Republic became a sovereign nation in 1993 following the demise of Czechoslovakia. The centre-right government made a final effort to balance the books in December when the budget seemed to be heading for a deficit of more than five billion crowns. It postponed some spending until 1997, and required early repayment of credit granted to a deposit insurance fund. Finance Ministry spokeswoman Ludmila Nutilova said revenues for 1996 totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.3 billion. Ministry officials have said the deficit might edge up even further since more bills might be delivered after the deadline. The budget has been hampered continually by lower than expected tax revenue and delayed repayment of credits to Russia. The original 1996 budget was balanced with spending and revenue at 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns. Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the opposition Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome. But he was concerned about the effects that government payment adjustments might have on the 1997 budget. Part of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which had been due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the ""alpha and omega"" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus made by the finance ministry soon after the New Year, as a sign of continued fiscal responsibility. Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997. But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996. Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=27.27 Czech Crown) ","AlanCrosby"
"Shareholders of electronics group Thomson SA rubber-stamped an 11 billion franc ($2.12 billion) state capital injection of Friday as the government reviewed how to relaunch the privatisation process. ""I believe we need a few days to think things over. We've been accused of amateurism and blundering, we're not going to rush into any statements now,"" a government official told Reuters. Industry Minister Franck Borotra received a delegation of Thomson worker representatives who wanted the government to drop the privatisation plans entirely, after the state on Wednesday announced it was suspending the sale. State-owned Thomson SA comprises 58 percent of defence electronics group Thomson-CSF and all of televison and video recorder maker Thomson Multimedia (TMM). Some 200 Thomson workers marched through the streets of Paris, welcoming a group of 15 employees that had walked for a week from the Thomson Multmedia plant in Angers in west France. ""Franck Borotra has expressed the government's intention to pursue the (Thomson) privatisation according to terms which will be detailed in the coming days,"" the industry ministry said. ""He has taken note of comments that TMM should be fully valued and reconfirmed the recapitalisation of this company."" The government on Wednesday suspended the sale, for a symbolic franc, of Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe because the independent Privatisation Commission could not agree with the terms of Lagardere's planned sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea. The French Foreign Ministry on Friday, asked by an irritated South Korea to explain itself, issued a statement aimed at easing the strain on its ties with an important trade partner. The ministry said France and South Korea enjoyed relations of ""respect, partnership and confidence"". Inside Thomson's Paris headquarters, state shareholders voted to back a capital increase needed to bolster the company's balance sheet ahead of an eventual sale. The shareholders are a handful of representatives for the state, telecom operator France Telecom and a pool of banks represented by the state-owned Caisse des Depots et de Consignations (CDC). Thomson said afterwards that the state would pay the bill, but the aid still needs EU approval. At the end of 1995, Thomson SA had debts of 25.3 billion francs of which 13.8 billion were at TMM and 2.3 billion at Thomson-CSF. Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Thursday he was not ruling out any options, including whether Thomson-CSF and TMM should be sold seperately rather than in one go. In February, President Jacques Chirac made the privatisation conditional on the group remaining intact. The Les Echos business newspaper said that if the government insisted on a package sale, Alcatel stood the best chances of winning. Alcatel Alsthom chairman Serge Tchuruk, whose rival offer had been sidelined by the government in October, recently suggested the state should sell Thomson SA intact but in stages. If the government accepted a split, Lagardere could still obtain control of Thomson-CSF and finalise the planned merger with its Matra Defence unit, Les Echos said.

"Polaris Industries Inc., best known for its snowmobiles, said Wednesday it will begin building motorcycles, riding its small-engine expertise into a market no major U.S. company other than Harley-Davidson Inc. has dared test in 40 years. Minneapolis-based Polaris said it is developing a highway cruiser motorcycle that will be named Victory and be available to consumers in the spring of 1998. ""We've built pretty much all of it from scratch. The engine was designed in the USA and it's going to be made in the USA,"" said Matt Parks, who will be general manager of the new Polaris motorcycles unit. Polaris is the world's largest maker of snowmobiles and is among the world's top three makers of all-terrain vehicles, or ATVs, and personal watercraft. ""We've competed successfully against Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Suzuki in our other businesses. ... Entering the motorcycle market is a logical extension of our diversification strategy,"" said Polaris Chief Executive Officer Hall Wendel. Shares in Polaris rose 37.5 cents to $26.25 on the New York Stock Exchange trading. Besides the legendary Harley-Davidson, there are only two other, much smaller U.S. motorcycle makers -- Salt Lake City-based ATK America Inc., a maker of specialised off-road machines, and Buell Motorcycle Co., which is 49 percent owned by Milwaukee-based Harley and also located in Wisconsin. Polaris said its new cruiser will compete with Harley's machines, as well as similar bikes from Honda and others. The company declined to disclose price or design specifications. ""It seems there is a market opportunity,"" said Beth Burnson, an industry analyst at the ABN-AMRO Chicago Corp brokerage and investment bank here. In recent years, Harley has been unable to make enough cruiser motorcycles to meet booming demand, leaving a hole in the market, Burnson said. ""Japanese companies have been able come up with Harley copycats that people will buy off the showroom floor if they don't want to wait two years for a Harley. That's the part of the market that Polaris can target,"" Burnson said. Polaris said it expects its existing customers -- an estimated 30 percent of whom are motorcyclists already -- will be among early buyers. The worldwide market for cruiser motorcycles is estimated at over 200,000 units annually, and sales of cruiser motorcycles have nearly doubled in the last five years, Polaris said. With personal watercraft sales expected to slump this year due to overstocking in 1996, and snowmobile sales flat, Polaris has relied for growth recently on strong ATV sales, said Scott Ciccarelli, an analyst at the Gerard Klauer Mattison brokerage and investment bank in New York. Challenging Harley, against which it has never competed, may be tough for Polaris, but moving into motorcycles is a logical next step for the company, he said. ""They've been hinting toward this for the last two years or so,"" Ciccarelli said. Engines for Polaris products are presently built in-house or by Japan's Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., which makes Subaru-brand cars, or by a Fuji-Polaris joint venture, Robin Manufacturing, in Hudson, Wis. Engines for the new motorcycles will be built at the Polaris engine plant in Osceola, Wis., and the motorcycles will be manufactured at the company's Spirit Lake, Iowa, plant, the company said. On Feb. 4, Polaris reported 1996 sales of $1.19 billion, up 7 percent from $1.11 billion in 1995. Annual profits were $62.3 million, up 2 percent over the previous year. Polaris said it expected 1997 sales to decline from the 1996 level but still show another year of record-setting profits. ""Expenses related to the development of the company's motorcycles are reflected in its expectations for 1997 net income in excess of 1996's record level,"" Polaris said. ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"Czech industrial output growth slowed in 1996, but analysts said they were more concerned with a sharp rise in wages that is dulling the country's competitive edge and exacerbating the impact of a widening trade deficit. The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Monday that industrial output, in real terms, rose 1.5 percent in December, putting output 6.8 percent higher for the whole of 1996, down from 9.2 percent for the previous year. It also said nominal industrial wages grew 17.4 percent last year, after 17 percent growth in 1995. While analysts said they were not surprised by the output figures due to a continued slowdown in the economies of the Czechs' biggest trading partners, they said wages were growing far too fast. ""I think the slowdown in output is not a big surprise given the problems with economies abroad and the stronger than expected crown,"" said Vladimir Kreidl, an economist at Patria Finance, who said he expects output to remain steady in 1997. ""The wage growth and trade deficits are by far the two most troublesome developments in the economy. Nominal wages should not be growing by more than 12 or 13 percent, which would be in line with productivity,"" he added. The crown has strengthened by some three percentage points against its currency basket since the beginning of the year, pushed higher mainly by demand from some 30 billion crowns worth of crown-denominated Eurobond issues. The strength of the crown has also negatively effected the trade deficit, stifling exports as the gap grew to a record of more than 160 billion crowns for 1996. ""The Czech Republic is a strong country but it's got to deal with some of the sypmtoms of success such as these very large capital inflows that have driven the currency too high,"" said Jonathan Garner, director of research at Robert Fleming. Added Patria's Kreidl: ""Wage growth could effect inflation but foreign competition is so strong that we haven't seen that impact yet, and probably won't. But at the same time, Czech companies are losing competitiveness."" The Czech crown is fixed daily at up to plus or minus 7.5 percent of the mid-point of a basket comprising 35 percent dollars and 65 percent marks. On Monday, the central bank fixed the crown at 28.357 to the dollar and 16.737 to the mark putting the currency 4.65 percent above the mid-point. Many investors have flocked to the crown given the Czech Republic's stable political and economic climate, and its high interest rates. Most analysts agree, however, that the central bank can ill afford to cut rates at the present, given the necessity to keep inflation and the money supply in check. ""There has to be some break in the development of nominal wages in industry. It will be difficult to do. Monetary policy must remain tight...there is no place for lower rates,"" said one analyst. In the middle of 1996 the CNB raised the discount rate to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent and increased minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months in the Republic hover around 12.5 percent. Though rates eased some 60 basis points in January, the central bank ond government officials have both expressed reluctance officially to lower rates because of strong demand for money and investments. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","AlanCrosby"
"Young drug discovery group Vanguard Medica Plc said on Thursday it could wait longer than expected before seeking a fresh cash injection. Vanguard floated on the stock exchange in May, raising 46.4 million stg to fund its pipeline, which includes migraine and kidney failure drugs. ""We said we'd be expecting to seek more finance in 1998, but we took in more money than we'd expected and may have scope for going on longer,"" commercial director Nick Heightman said in a telephone interview following interim results.   Vanguard said on Thursday that its pretax loss in the six months to June 30 widened to 3.7 million stg from 1.8 million a year earlier, largely due to the cost of moving migraine drug VML 251 and anti-inflammatory drug VML 295 through trials. Heightman, who joined Vanguard from drug giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc, said the company had expected to announce results of large-scale intermediate, or Phase II, trials on the migraine drug by July 1997. ""I think we are going to be able to do that in the first quarter, so we are about a quarter ahead,"" he said.   Analysts say the migraine drug, which is being developed in cooperation with SmithKline Beecham Plc accounts for around half of Vanguard's current stock market valuation. Some studies have shown it may be more potent than the current market leader, Glaxo Wellcome's Imigran, although Heightman said direct comparisons cannot be made for another 18 months. He said another Vanguard drug, VML 252, which promises to tackle bone damage suffered by patients with severe kidney problems, is now ""running neck and neck"" with the migraine treatment.   Although VDL 252 is currently in Phase I trials, Heightman said it is likely to progress more quickly through trials than the migraine drug. ""Its effectiveness is particularly easy to measure. You can quickly tell if you are having an effect,"" he told Reuters. Heightman believes both drugs could be on the market in the year 2000 if trials continue to go well. Despite the positive news from the company, Vanguard shares dropped 5 1/2 pence to 495 pence on Thursday.   Greig Middleton analyst Julia Dickson expressed surprise at the fall, saying the market ""doesn't seem to understand the company."" ""We think it is very cheap and I am surprised it is off,"" Dickson said, adding that the company's statement was ""very positive"" and Vanguard's meeting with analysts on Thursday showed drugs are progressing even faster than the company has officialy acknowledged. Lehman Brothers' analyst Ian Smith said the ""share price adequately reflects the value of the current portfolio, with some excellent opportunities,"" particualrly in migraine and kidney-related problems. He said in the medium- to long-term, the value will depend on Vanguard's ability to attract further partnerships like that with SmithKline Beecham, a cornerstone of Vanguard's growth strategy. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","JonathanBirt"
"The lean times for the video game software industry appear to be over. Three of the largest game developers on Thursday reported results for the crucial December quarter that were better than Wall Street expected. Electronic Arts Inc., Activision Inc. and Spectrum Holobyte Inc. said strong sales of games for personal computers and next-generation video game consoles, such as the Sony PlayStation, contributed to the strong results. For the past year, the video game software industry had been in a funk while consumers waited for the release of advanced game machines from Sony Corp., Sega Enterprises and Nintendo Corp. The industry also lacked blockbusters to draw customers to the video game isle at stores. The release of the PlayStation last year and the Nintendo 64 this year has revitalised the industry, analysts said. ""People are underestimating how truly red hot sales of the video game systems are,"" said David Farina, an analyst at brokerage William Blair &amp; Co. in Chicago. ""If history is any guide, we're in for a strong two-year cycle for my investors, cross my finger."" After the market closed, Electronic Arts, the biggest U.S. game publisher, said net income for its fiscal third quarter, ended Dec. 31, rose 25 percent to $36.7 million, or 66 cents a share, from $29.3 million, or 54 cents, in the same quarter a year ago. Electronic Arts' revenue in the quarter jumped 13 percent to $271.1 million from $240.1 million on strong sales of games for the PlayStation and PCs, the company said. Activision, another big game vendor, said net income in its Christmas quarter more than doubled to $4.12 million, or 28 cents, from $1.95 million, or 13 cents, a year ago. Spectrum Holobyte, based in Alameda, Calif., said net income in the December quarter was $5.7 million, or 20 cents a share, more than double the 9 cents Wall Street expected. In the same quarter last year, Spectrum Holobyte had a loss of $9.95 million, or 41 cents a share. The strong earnings likely will continue into the March quarter, analysts said, as consumers buy a new generation of PCs based on Intel Corp.'s MMX technology, which soups up the graphics capabilities of the machines.

"Pier 1 Imports is targeting earnings growth this year near the high end of its annual objective of 15 to 18 percent over the life of a five-year business plan, Chief Executive Clark Johnson said Wednesday. ""The Street has got us up toward the higher end of that range and I think we have an internal goal to do better than that, but that's an internal goal and it's not a forecast,"" Johnson told Reuters in an interview after a presentation to investors at a Raymond James conference here.   Raymond James projects the retailer will report fiscal 1997 earnings of $1.25 per share, up 19 percent from $1.05 for fiscal 1996 ended February 28. Johnson said Pier 1 projects sales this year will rise about $100 million. The company, which has 725 stores in North America plus joint ventures in England, Mexico and Japan, posted fiscal 1996 sales of $944.6 million. He said the company will open 53 stores this year and close about 25. Remodeling and remerchandising of store layouts is also under way throughout much of the chain, reflecting a change in product lines, he said.   At the end of its fiscal year last month, Pier 1 stopped selling apparel. It is beefing up its home furnishings offerings in response to what it sees as changing consumer attitudes. ""The Martha Stewart syndrome is alive and well in America,"" Johnson said. ""There's been a shift in consumer spending away from apparel, and even in this past holiday season away from consumer electronics and toward home furnishings,"" he said. Pier 1 is also launching a bridal registry program that Johnson said is expected to take further advantage of the trend toward higher sales of furniture, fixtures and other items for the home. The company operates a joint venture in England called ""The Pier."" Johnson said it is expected to break even this year after losing money last year. He said expansion in Japan continues. ""We think it's possible to eventually have about 200 stores in Japan,"" he said. ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"The board of utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux, involved in merger talks with holding company Cie de Suez, was due to meet on Wednesday afternoon to approve the 1996 accounts, a company spokeswoman said. Suez and Lyonnaise are negotiating a merger which could put assets of the cash-rich holding company at the disposal of the utilities company with global ambitions. Lyonnaise will publish its results on Thursday morning, which analysts expect to show net attributable profit of between 1.0 and 1.5 billion francs, after a 1995 profit of 906 million. But more importantly, the market is hungry for details of the merger, specifically the financial terms and the industrial strategy, analysts said. The boards have to address scepticism over whether there really is an industrial sense to the merger, or whether the deal is no more than a glorified capital increase for Lyonnaise through Suez, which owns a 16.8 percent stake in Lyonnaise. Some of the potential industrial integration may have been curtailed with undertakings that Suez's indirectly-held services subsidiary Tractebel will be kept independent in Belgium. And if this is to be a pure financial injection, a payment of a Suez special dividend to shareholders before any merger may erode that benefit. ""This is a major transaction. The objectives have to be clear,"" said an analyst. ""There has to be a clear strategy, there must be an industrial logic behind this link-up,"" he added. So far the market has fed on rumours and speculation on a share swap of two Suez shares for every one Lyonnaise. Some analysts believe the merger makes sense in general terms, but want to know what the combined group would look like in detail. ""Does one plus one make one-and-a-half or two?"" asked the analyst. ""Vague talk of synergies is not enough."" Another analyst wanted to know how the operating units will be brought together, what subsidiaries will be sold and how the proceeds will be used to develop the group. Lyonnaise has activities in water distribution, waste treatment, energy production, construction and communications. Suez has sold its Banque Indosuez investment bank and property assets to focus on providing services to local authorities, mainly held in its Tractebel unit. The two groups have performed weakly throughout the nineties and have lacked a strategy, said the second analyst. The new combined company must show it has a direction and can provide a return to shareholders. Investors in Suez stock have effectively lost a third of their money if they bought shares in 1987 when the company was privatised at 317 francs per share, he said. Lyonnaise, saddled by a 1990 purchase of the Dumez construction group and property losses, has shown a poor return on equity of five or six percent, a rate bettered by an investment in bonds, he added. Suez stock was up 0.35 percent at 286.90 francs at 1100 GMT, while Lyonnaise was down 1.26 percent at 547 francs. Some of the questions being asked are, what will Suez do with units unrelated to services, like its Sofinco consumer credit house? Will Lyonnaise keep its loss-making construction firm GTM-Entrepose ?. How fast will Suez pursue its disposal plan for financial assets and how will the cash be invested? Suez said on Tuesday it would pay an unspecified special dividend in June to reflect capital gains on the sale investment bank Banque Indosuez. A big Suez shareholder, the Saint-Gobain glass-making company, called on Tuesday for a 10 percent payment on Suez's financial assets estimated at a total 34 billion francs. Total Suez assets are estimated at 50 billion, including Tractebel. Suez said on Tuesday that its board was unanimously in favour of a merger with Lyonnaise. Both the Lyonnaise and Suez boards will have special meetings on April 11 to dicuss the terms of the merger. ","PierreTran"
"General Motors Corp.'s move to deflate Wall Street expectations about its fourth-quarter earnings will not likely be repeated by rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., analysts said Thursday. GM told analysts Wednesday that its fourth-quarter North American incentive and other marketing costs were higher than earlier estimates, causing analysts to slash their estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars. The automaker also said its product mix in Europe will be weaker than expected, with the low-margin Corsa subcompact making up a bigger portion of sales, and new product launch costs remain high. As a result, many analysts slashed their estimates by 45 cents to 50 cents a share, helping to drive down GM stock by $1.375 over the past two days, to close at $54.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Burnham Securities analyst David Healy now estimates that GM will earn $435 million, or 52 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, excluding extraordinary items. Among other items, GM plans to take a charge of $170 million, or 22 cents a share, to make lump-sum payments to United Auto Workers members as part of the company's new contract with the union. GM also previously disclosed that strikes in the United States and Canada during the quarter reduced its fourth-quarter profit by about $700 million. In the fourth quarter of 1995, GM earned $1.87 billion, or $1.98 a share. Analyst Michael Ward of brokerage PaineWebber Inc. said GM appears to be viewing the fourth quarter as a ""cleanup quarter"" and may accelerate some costs to help improve next year's results. But analysts did not expect Ford and Chrysler to reveal similar surprises with marketing costs. ""Both Ford and Chrysler are more heavily weighted toward trucks,"" said brokerage A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons analyst Michael Braig. ""I don't know that I have to get any more skeptical than I have already been with them."" Ford could earn as much as $1.25 billion, or $1.03 a share, in the fourth quarter before extraordinary items, according to a consensus estimate by First Call Corp., which tracks analyst forecasts. That total excludes an expected charge of $400 million, or 34 cents a share, to cover costs of an early retirement program for salaried workers. In the fourth quarter of 1995, new product launch costs held Ford's profit to $660 million, or 48 cents a share. Although Ford continues to struggle with problems in Europe and Brazil, it is reaping benefits in North America from its new F-150 pickup truck, the new Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle and continued strong sales of the Explorer sport utility. Ford said Thursday it sold 2 million trucks in a single year for the first time ever, including 800,000 F-Series trucks. Lehman Brothers brokerage analyst Joseph Phillippi said Ford may announce another onetime charge for restructuring its European operations in the fourth quarter. Ford officials have declined to discuss plans for specific cost-cutting actions in Europe, but expect such actions to pay off in 1997. Chrysler, which is enjoying a record sales year, is expected to cruise to a fourth-quarter profit of more than $1 billion, or about $1.40 a share, according to First Call. Driving the Chrysler earnings are strong sales of minivans, pickup trucks, and sport utility vehicles. Chrysler chief economist Van Bussmann said Thursday that the automaker's market share, now at about 16 percent vs. 12 percent five years ago, should grow further in 1997. The automaker is introducing a new generation of large sedans and a new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle based on its new Dakota pickup truck. ","DavidLawder"
"Australian paper and packaging group Amcor Ltd on Thursday reported a big fall in half-year profit and said higher paper prices and fatter margins were still over six months away. Amcor announced a 34 percent slide in net profit before abnormal items to A$140.6 million for the six months to December 31, a little below the average market forecast of A$145 million and accompanied by a dour outlook for the rest of 1996/97. Amcor blamed the fall on a steep fall in paper prices since they hit historic highs in the same six months of 1995/96.   A squeeze on margins from customers in the packaging businesses also dragged earnings down, despite an overall rise in production volumes, it added. ""It just kind of limped along,"" Amcor managing director Don Macfarlane said of the half-year trading conditions. So did the company's share price, which closed 14 cents lower at A$8.35 on Thursday, reflecting what brokers said was Amcor's bearish comments about the rest of 1996/97 to June 30. ","MarkBendeich"
"Hewlett-Packard Co. stock surged in heavy trading Wednesday, a day after the computer and printer maker reported surprisingly strong first-quarter profits that were its highest in eight years. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. upgraded their ratings on the company's stock and raised earnings estimates amid renewed confidence in the company's growth and cost management prospects. Hewlett-Packard rose $7.375, or nearly 13 percent, to close at $56.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most active issue on volume of more than 9.1 million. The stock traded as high as $57.50, just shy of its record high of $57.63 reached last spring. Late Tuesday, Hewlett-Packard reported profits of $912 million, or 87 cents a share, on revenues of $10.3 billion in its first quarter ended Jan. 31. In the year-ago period, it earned $790 million, or 75 cents a share, on revenues of $9.3 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share to be unchanged. ""Nearly all of the positive earnings surprise was driven by improved gross margins,"" NatWest Securities said in a report, echoing comments by other analysts citing Hewlett-Packard's strong asset management controls during the quarter. HeWlett-Packard said gross profit margins rose to 35 percent in its first quarter, up by more than 2 percentage points from 32.8 percent in the fourth quarter. Hewlett-Packard Chief Financial Officer Bob Wayman said Hewlett-Packard pared inventories by 8 percent in its first quarter while revenues rose 11 percent to $10.3 billion, a sharp contrast to the prior year when inventories grow 54 percent, or twice as fast as its 27 percent revenue growth. Analysts said they were cheered by the company's ability to trim its cost of sales across virtually all its businesses -- a process which company executives said would remain a key focus. ""That's why we and a number of other people consider them the best-managed company in the (computer industry) group,"" said John Jones, industry analyst at Salomon Brothers. Jones said he had upgraded his earnings per share estimates by 6.6 percent to $3.25 from $3.05 for the fiscal year ending in September 1997, and by 4.3 percent to $3.65 from $3.50 for fiscal 1998 and reiterating the firm's ""buy"" rating on the stock. ""I think there's upside in their numbers, but at this point I'd like to see us get through the next quarter,"" Jones said. ""We've got one more tough comparison and then the numbers get a lot easier."" Hewlett-Packard fell short of expectations in the final two quarters of fiscal 1996 after two blockbuster quarters, and management cautioned analysts again Tuesday that its second quarter will be measured against 33 percent revenue growth a year ago. ""The exceptional growth that they had last year is really having a negative impact on them,"" Jones said. ""Right now, people are basically comfortable with this being a 15 to 18 percent growth company."" NatWest also raised its 1997 and 1998 earnings estimates and continued to recommend accumulating Hewlett-Packard stock, which it said was very attractive at current levels and could reach $66 within in 12 months. Goldman Sachs, which had previously rated Hewlett-Packard's stock ""outperform,"" put it on the brokerage's recommended list and raised its 1997 earnings estimate to $3.25 from $3.00. ","SamuelPerry"
"Royal Bank of Canada said on Thursday it plans a massive share buyback to boost shareholder value and offset the dilutive impact of acquiring brokerage firm Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. Royal Bank, Canada's largest bank, said it may repurchase up to 10 percent of its 313 million outstanding common shares over the next 12 months. The bank's stock soared C$1.05 (76 cents) to close at C$36.20 ($26.40) after earlier hitting a 52-week high of C$36.25 ($26.45) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Based on the current share price, the buyback is worth about C$1.1 billion ($800 million). ""Given the projections for internal capital generation going forward, we concluded that this was in the best interest of our shareholders,"" Matthew Frank, Royal Bank's manager of capital and term funding, said in a telephone interview. Royal Bank recently surpassed the C$1 billion ($729 million) mark in net profit for the first nine months of fiscal 1996, putting it on track for a third straight year of record earnings. It is the third major Canadian bank to announce a huge share buyback in the past year. In July, Toronto-Dominion Bank, the country's fifth-largest bank, said it will repurchase up to 10 percent of its common shares, valued at C$720 million ($525 million). Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's second-biggest bank, announced plans to buy back about 5 percent of its shares last November. ""I think it's possible that you will get additional buybacks,"" an industry analyst said, noting that all six major banks have posted record results this year. Royal Bank said the share plan will offset any dilution arising from the bank's proposed C$480 million ($350 million) acquisition of Toronto-based Richardson Greenshields which is to close Nov. 1. The bank is offering Richardson Greenshields shareholders up to C$240 million ($175 million) in cash with the balance payable in shares exchangeable for Royal Bank common shares. Analysts said the share repurchase will more than offset the dilutive effect of the brokerage deal. ""It's a bit more than they need, but I guess if you're sitting on capital why not get a little more bang for your buck,"" another banking analyst said. The big buyback will not affect the bank's future acquisition strategy, bank officials said. Royal Bank, which listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange last year, has said it is interested in a U.S. acquisition, but at the right price. Last month, the bank was mentioned in U.S. media reports as a potential bidder for U.S. mutual and pension-fund manager Columbia Management Co. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla, March 26, Reuter - A Florida judge on Wednesday ordered Liggett Group to immediately deliver internal industry documents for possible use in the state of Florida's lawsuit against U.S. tobacco companies. Courts in Texas and Illinois have issued similar orders since Thursday, when Liggett Group, the fifth largest cigarette maker, owned by Brooke Group, struck a sweeping deal with 22 states suing the tobacco industry for an estimated $30 billion spent on medicaid costs for treating sick smokers.   The Florida judge, Harold Cohen of Palm Beach County Circuit Court, also ordered an accelerated review within 10 days of about 20 Liggett documents which attorneys for the state of Florida claim affect public safety. Under Florida law, trade-secret protections and client-lawyer privilege ordinarily safeguarding internal documents can be overriden if matters of public safety are at stake. Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth in court urged Cohen to review the Liggett papers and afterwards told reporters the 20 documents, which he said he had not seen, would be made public if the judge agrees that public health was at issue.   ""These documents are devastating to the industry,"" Butterworth said. Cohen said he would assign William Rutter, a retired judge aiding in the pre-trial screening of contested documents, to review the 20 documents in 10 days and to make a recommendation to him. A hearing on that recommendation will be held April 14, Cohen said.   Cohen ruled after Murray Granick, an attorney for Philip Morris Cos, said a temporary restraining order on distributing the LIggett documents secured last Thursday in North Carolina did not preclude private review of the papers by other judges in tobacco cases. Granick said the judge in North Carolina, who had issued the temporary restraint last week, had late yesterday amended his order removing any constraints on other judges looking at the papers in private.   Granick said, in court, that the tobacco companies fighting the lawsuits wanted to protect the privacy privileges of their clients. He also said that some of the Liggett documents drawn from industry-wide talks over the years would, if released, violate the rights of the tobacco companies. Cohen has scheduled an August 4 start to a jury trial on the Florida lawsuit, the second after Mississippi's expected to come to trial. Florida is claiming $1 billion or more for tobacco-related Medicare spending and has won the right to pursue much higher monies if the tobacco companies are found to have operated as racketeers under a state conspiracy law. The tobacco companies deny any conspiracy and claim the state has itself produced cigarettes for prison inmates and benefitted in many other ways from their businesses. -- Miami newsroom, 305-374-5013 ","MichaelConnor"
"Long-troubled solid waste company Mid-American Waste Systems Inc filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday and said it signed an agreement to sell most assets to fast-growing rival USA Waste Services Inc. The Ohio-based firm had suffered a string of financial losses stemming from a huge appetite for acquisitions and development projects, said people familiar with the company. ""They were highly leveraged and got into a situation where they were losing money,"" said Melville Cody of Williams MacKay Jordan &amp; Co Inc.   In a statement, Mid-American said it would sell nearly all its assets to Houston-based USA Waste Services for $180 million in cash and stock. The transaction is subject to bankruptcy court approval. Mid-American chief executive Gene Meredith was meeting with staff on Wednesday and was unavailable for comment. The company was been trying desperately to cut costs, but was unable to stem the flow of losses, analysts said. It sold its Atlanta assets nearly a year ago to Republic Industries Inc, the diversified Florida company led by billionaire Wayne Huizenga.   The sale of Mid-American's assets comes amid intense consolidation in the highly-fragmented solid waste industry. For USA Waste, the transaction with Mid-American marks the latest in a string of acquisitions that has taken the company from annual revenue of about $4 million in 1990 to an estimated $2 billion in 1997. ""I think USA Waste has clearly shown they can maintain the momentum of consolidation at this juncture,"" said Michael Hoffman of CS First Boston, who rates the stock a buy and raised 1997 earnings estimates to $1.70 per share from $1.65 and increased 1998 estimates to $2.15 per share from $2.05.   USA Waste anticipates the Mid-American acquisition will add $115 million in annualized revenues, according to analysts who participated in a telephone conference call with the firm. USA Waste did not return a phone call and analysts said executives were involved with a sales and marketing pitch for an upcoming offering of 10 million common shares. Analysts also said that USA Waste has targeted $400 million in acquisitions this year, excluding the Mid-American asset purchase and last week's announced $518 million acquisition of the Canadian assets of Allied Waste Industries Inc.   Analysts also anticipate cost savings from some overlap of the Mid-American assets. ""They have been so effective in integrating large acquisitions,"" Cody said about USA Waste. In September, USA Waste bought Sanifill Inc in a $1.6 billion stock transaction that solidified its position as the nation's third-largest waste management company. The two top posts are held by Allied Waste and Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. ""They're moving up fast and there are still a lot of acquisition opportunities,"" Cody said. ","RobinSidel"
"Federal bank regulators have begun prodding U.S. financial institutions to prepare for possible computer problems in the year 2000. Many computers and software programs record only the last two digits of a year and could mistakenly treat the year 2000 as the year 1900. For banks, confused computers could erroneously trigger a wave of bounced checks, missed loan payments and miscalculated interest rates. In letters to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato, regulators said they were aware of the dangers.   The various agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said they had formed an interagency working group to address the issue, often referred to as the ""Millennium Bug."" ""The costs of making systems year 2000 compliant will be substantial and may affect some banks' earnings,"" Comptroller Eugene Ludwig, whose office oversees almost 3,000 national banks, wrote in a letter dated March 21. ""Most experts believe that even the most prepared organizations will encounter some problems.""   ""The year 2000 rollover could pose substantial risks to the financial services industry,"" Nicholas Retsinas, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, warned. Analysts have said corporations and governments might have to spend $300 to $600 billion worldwide to correct the problem by rewriting software and reprogramming hardware. Even if banks correct all of their own computers, they could be brought down by computer errors from their major customers or third-party vendors, the regulators added.   Bank examiners will question banks about year 2000 preparations this year, hopefully alerting them in time for solutions to be implemented and tested well before the end of 1999. Some programs may fail much sooner as they try to process current transactions such as mortgage loans that extend beyond the year 2000. ""This is not a project that can be delayed or the deadline extended,"" Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Director Nicholas Ketcha wrote in a recent memo to the agency's regional directors. ""Because of the nature of some date related calculations, many software programs currently running which are not year 2000 compliant may fail at some point prior to December 31, 1999."" The letters were in response to a query on the topic issued by Senator D'Amato earlier this month. The Banking Committee is reviewing the responses and had no immediate comment, a spokesman said.

"Declared cocoa arrivals at Ivorian ports for Ivory Coast's 1996/97 (October-April) main crop totalled 970-980,000 tonnes by April 14, close to record levels seen in the 1995/96 season, exporters and crop analysts said. The 1995/96 main crop (ending April 30) reached just over a million tonnes. ""Arrivals are now at a trickle compared to last year but it is still possible the total (main crop) will reach a million by the end of the month,"" said one crop analyst. Exporters said cocoa was arriving at Ivory Coast's two ports -- Abidjan and San Pedro -- at a total of up to 5,000 tonnes a week, compared to 8,000 tonnes a week in 1995/96. Little or no main crop cocoa remained on south-western plantations visited by Reuters. ""Cocoa is now for the mid-crop (usually smaller, poorer quality beans),"" said one coastal area buyer. Ivory Coast has forecast 950,000 tonnes for the 1996/97 season but some private forecasters upgraded their full-year predictions from that level to around 1.1 million tonnes after large arrivals in early 1997. Last year, Ivory Coast produced a full-year record of 1.2 million tonnes after a bumper 200,000 tonne mid-crop (May-September). Sources said Ministry of Agriculture data showed cocoa arrivals to April 4 (from October 24) stood at 940,0000 tonnes -- about six percent down from 1,003,366 last year. Another 40,000 tonnes or so should be added to the 1996/97 figure as the season opened three weeks later than the usual October 1, they said. Other arrivals data seen by Reuters gave similar figures. ""The latest figures I have from the Caistab (cocoa and coffee marketing board) show arrivals at about 975,000 by April 14 but that is after some downward adjustments for sub-grade (inferior beans),"" said one source. Arrivals to the end of the main crop in 1994/95 were 815,000 tonnes, with weekly arrivals of under 4,000 tonnes. Trade sources say exporters usually over-estimate arrivals early in the season to help secure bank finance, but square accounts later in the season by under-declaring. Crop forecasters say declared arrivals in Ivory Coast can exceed tree crop harvests as quantities of cocoa are carried between seasons in the hope of price rises and to mix poor with good quality cocoa. One cocoa buyer for Ivorian exporter Jean-Abile Gal (JAG) said the latest cocoa bean sizes averaged 98 beans per 100 grammes at San Pedro, and 105 at the main port, Abidjan -- against an export standard of up to 105 with less than eight percent humidity. Exporters said average humidity levels at both ports were below eight percent. Up-country buyers' stores in coastal and south-western areas were mostly empty, except for coffee, but larger warehouses at San Pedro, including JAG's, were still well stocked. ""There is nothing left. Some exporters are desperate to meet contracts and cannot get cocoa,"" said one buyer. ""Cocoa harvested now is really for the mid-crop (from May)."" Port forwarders' figures seen by Reuters showed 1996/97 cocoa volumes handled 12 percent down on 1995/96, but managers said warehouse stocks for end-April shipment would close the gap. ""It is very acceptable. We thought the gap could be twice that,"" said a manager for SAGA, San Pedro's largest forwarder. ""Last year, arrivals figures were a lot more available so it has been harder to track."" Cocoa bean shipments rose from 39,637 tonnes in February to 51,981 in March and at least another 10,000 tonnes was due to leave next week. ""Some of what is left in stores will be for local processors (using around 135,000 tonnes of beans a year),"" said one crop analyst. SACO, San Pedro's only factory, had large volumes of produce stored in sheds with bagged cocoa under external awnings. Cocoa product exports totalled around 4,000 tonnes for February and March. Several new warehouses are planned to increase port cocoa storage capacity. New factories are also in the pipeline. Exporters are now looking forward to pod counters' mid-crop predictions, expected this month, and further news on Ivory Coast's intention to destroy illegal cocoa plantations in classified forest areas. The country's Minister for Commodities, Guy-Alain Gauze, said earlier on Friday in the Netherlands that the upcoming mid-crop would be somewhere near 100,000 tonnes. ","MatthewBunce"
"Opponents of U.S. trade concessions to China are expected to mount the fiercest congressional battle in years to overturn President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's favored trading status. While supporters of the president's decision on Monday to renew China's most favored nation (MFN) status for another year remain confident of victory, opponents -- ranging from social conservatives to organized labor -- are revving up for a fight. The unusual coalition is blasting the move from both sides of the political spectrum, hitting China's policies on human rights, labor rights, religious rights, trade and abortion. Opponents are also gathering strength from worries over the transfer this summer of Hong Kong to China, as well as the brouhaha over charges that Beijing tried to sway U.S. elections through illegal campaign contributions. ""With Hong Kong and campaign finance lurking in the background, it will definitely be a tougher fight,"" a congressional aide, who requested anonymity, said. ""A lot depends on what happens between now and the vote."" Another congressional aide said, ""The coalition of the AFL-CIO and social conservatives makes for a potent force."" House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said this year's decision would be closer than last year's 286-141 vote in the House to back Clinton on MFN. But advocates and even opponents expect the president's policy ultimately to survive. Gingrich, in a toughly worded statement, said he supported MFN status for China, but blasted Clinton for not using his announcement to press China for advances on human rights, democratic freedoms and religious tolerance. Even if lawmakers muster enough votes to reject the president's decision -- which is considered unlikely -- opponents doubt they could round up the two-thirds vote needed to override an expected veto from Clinton. Congress later this summer will vote on whether to overturn Clinton's decision, with the House voting first. ""The opponents have a better chance than they have had in the past several years. But it still may not be enough of a margin to withstand a veto,"" said Thea Lee, international expert at the AFL-CIO, which opposes MFN status for China. But even a defeat for MFN's opponents could amount to a sort of victory if the vote is close enough. ""It represents an important turning point in the growing uneasiness among both Democrats and Republicans over the current China trade policy,"" Lee said. Gary Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said: ""The president's action represents the high-water mark of the pro-MFN forces. As the truth of the human rights violations in China reaches the American public, the case for MFN collapses."" A sign Clinton will face tougher sledding emerged a week ago, when an influential House Republican leader urged the president to revoke China's MFN status, citing Beijing's record on human rights, weapon sales and trade. Rep. Bill Paxon of New York, a Gingrich ally who chairs meetings of the Republican House leadership team, said current U.S. policy had yielded only ""a Chinese regime which thumbs its nose at the United States and places its heel on the neck of freedom."" Another Republican, Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, introduced a bill in Congress on Monday that would give China permanent MFN status. Democratic lawmakers are also critical of China. Since Clinton ""delinked trade from human rights three years ago, the human rights situation in China and Tibet has deteriorated, the U.S. trade deficit with China has soared, and China's authoritarian government has continued its sale of nuclear, chemical, missile and biological weapons technology to dangerous countries, including Iran,"" Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said. But supporters of the administration's policy remain confident. ""In the end, the votes will be there for MFN,"" said Calman Cohen of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, representing the heads of big U.S. corporations. ","RogerFillion"
"Global miner RTZ-CRA on Wednesday announced a major relignment of its sprawling minerals empire and removed any doubt that London was its capital. The group, born of a 1995 merger of RTZ Plc and CRA Ltd, said it would now manage its world-wide businesses along six main product lines -- aluminium, copper, energy, industrial minerals, iron ore, and gold and other minerals. It also said it would downsize its Melbourne office, CRA Ltd's headquarters, halving the number of jobs there and reducing its role to a support function.   CRA chairman John Uhrig said in outlining the changes that the merger, which maintained the two firm' separate listings, had so far not produced a better outcome for shareholders. ""It would have been surprising if it had in its first year of operation,"" Uhrig told a news conference in Melbourne. The restructure leaves Australian-based executives to manage the aluminium, energy and iron ore businesses from Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. London handles the rest and remains the sole group headquarters, RTZ-CRA said.   The Salt Lake City office of its Kennecott copper operation in the United States as well as the group's Johannesburg office would be closed, it added. The new structure shifts the focus of management away from a geographical view of the world, where operations differ by country, toward a single management for each global business. It eliminates problems of overlapping time zones and managements, ensuring the group does not become an unwieldy bureaucracy unable to compete with rivals dealing in just one commodity, the group said.   Chief executive Leon Davis gave examples where, under the current structure, copper operations and coal mines were under several different leaderships across the globe. ""These are barriers that are artificially created and we are intent on removing them,"" Davis told the news conference. ""It will eliminate duplication, lower our costs and improve our efficiency,"" he added. Mining analysts welcomed the move, with one seeing it as confirmation the RTZ-CRA marriage, made without RTZ making a takeover bid, was effectively a cheap buy-out of CRA.   ""If anyone thought the DLC (dual-listed structure) was anything other than a buy-out on the cheap they should assess this little move because they are virtually wiping out Melbourne head office,"" a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters. The analyst said he expected the group to go a step further and rationalise its assets and then transform the dual-listed structure into the one company. RTZ-CRA has already proposed to ditch its double-barrelled name and become known, subject to shareholder approval this year, as Rio Tinto. RTZ's shares would then trade in London as Rio Tinto Plc and CRA's stock in Australia as Rio Tinto Ltd.   A Melbourne-based analyst said the cementing of London as the group's headquarters came as no surprise. ""It doesn't make any sense to have two head offices,"" he said. That would come as cold comfort for the 100 people whose jobs have been scrapped in Melbourne under the reorganisation. But RTZ-CRA said it would carry out the job cuts as painlessly as possible. ""The group will provide both practical and financial assistance to help their transition,"" it said. -- Melbourne bureau 61-3 9286-1421 ","MarkBendeich"

"The world's biggest prescription drugs company, Glaxo Wellcome Plc, announced an 18 percent leap in pre-tax profits on Thursday, but said life would be tougher after its best-selling drug loses its U.S. patent in July. Pre-tax profits climbed to 2.964 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) from 2.505 billion, bang in the middle of analysts' expectations. Sales rose 9 percent to 8.341 billion pounds, and shareholders were rewarded with a 13 percent rise in the dividend to 34.0 pence. Shares in Glaxo Wellcome, which slipped back to a low of 981 pence at one stage, were down just 7 1/2 pence to 10.27 1/2 pounds as analysts responded positively to a meeting with the company. Traders said some profit-taking had been expected after the stock touched a record 10.63 on Wednesday. Sales of gastric ulcer treatment Zantac fell 14 percent last year, but at 1.931 billion pounds it continued to be the world's biggest-selling drug, a spot it has held since 1986. Zantac has single-handedly transformed Glaxo, which merged with rival Wellcome in 1995, into a huge international player. Sales of its second-biggest seller, herpes treatment Zovirax which has already lost most of its key patents, were steady at 812 million pounds. Glaxo warned that the best it could hope for over the next two years would be to ""at least maintain"" its profits at the 1996 level. ""The tough period is mid-1997 to mid-1998 when Zantac will come under severe generic pressure in the U.S.,"" deputy chairman and chief executive Sir Richard Sykes said in a telephone interview with Reuters. But he added: ""If you take Zantac out we have a 6.4 billion pound business growing at 14 percent. That underlying growth is a very clear indication of the strength of the group going forward."" Sykes noted that sales of Zantac fell by 324 million pounds last year, while a portfolio of newer products launched since 1990 saw sales rise by 650 million pounds to 2.0 billion pounds. ""Our responsibility is to grow those new products to maintain these two (sales) lines in balance as much as possible. It is a balancing act,"" he said. The best performers included Glaxo Wellcome's rejuvenated HIV and AIDS treatments. Retrovir and Epivir are at the cornerstone of new cocktails of drugs which have shown startling success in reducing the levels of the virus in the blood to virtually undetectable levels, giving Glaxo Wellcome the lion's share of a rapidly expanding market. ""Today we have 57 percent of the AIDS market and I don't see why we won't continue to be a very major player,"" Sykes said. Other big sellers included asthma drugs Serevent and Flixotide and migraine drug Imigran, which saw sales in the U.S. alone leap by 69 percent last year. Despite persistent speculation that Glaxo Wellcome will get onto the acquisition trail again as soon as its debt levels allow, Sykes told Reuters there had been a clear dissipation of the pressures for mega-mergers. He said Glaxo Wellcome's future expansion was likely to be ""incremental."" ""The pressures of the early 1990s have changed somewhat in the big markets. The bigger companies get, the more difficult it is to buy them or merge, so the way forward will be much more looking at regional and local opportunities and building these as opportunities come along,"" he said.

"Apple Computer Inc., undertaking a second restructuring in a year, is expected to announce Friday thousands of job cuts and a huge loss for the second quarter, analysts said. The Cupertino, Calif., personal computer maker also will specify which product lines it plans to drop as it concentrates on businesses that are still relatively healthy. Since Apple announced in January that it expects to report quarterly losses until at least September 1997, trade magazines and newspaper reports have speculated the company would have to fire between 2,000 to 5,000 of its 13,000 employees to adjust its costs to declining revenues. ""I would not be surprised if the layoffs were deeper than the original estimates,"" said James Poyner, an analyst at investment bank Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. Apple executives have said they expect revenue for this fiscal year ending September to decline about 20 percent to about $8 billion. The company would have to cut at least $400 million in costs this year to break even. Apple may have to cut costs even deeper because Macintosh sales are declining faster than expected, analysts said. In the March quarter, worldwide shipments of Macintosh computers will fall to about 804,000 units, compared with 884,000 units in the March quarter of 1996, said Matt Sargent, analyst at market research firm Computer Intelligence InfoCorp. Apple also will tell investors which product lines it will cut. Analysts have speculated the Newton handheld computer could be discontinued or sold to another computer company. Last week, company Chairman Gilbert Amelio told employees in an internal letter the company would specify the cuts this Friday. ""I would like to hear clear bullet points on what they are going to do and what they are not going to do,"" said Stephen Dube, an analyst at Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York. ""Every time Amelio has spoken, he has sent confusing messages."" Dube said he expects Apple on Friday will forecast the size of its losses from operations for the quarter ending in March. Separately, Apple will announce in the next few weeks that it is changing its licensing agreements with makers of computers that use its Macintosh operating system. Companies such as Umax Technologies Inc. and Power Computing Corp. have thrived in recent months since they introduced personal computers that use Macintosh-based software. Their success has come partly at the cost of Apple, because the clone makers sell machines that cost less than comparable offerings from Apple. Analysts said they expect Apple to raise the royalty fee it charges the clone makers. An Apple spokeswoman said the company is reviewing its royalty agreements but would not say whether it will raise them. The success of the clone makers has had one silver lining for Apple: it has raised the Macintosh operating system's share of the market. In the December quarter, Apple's share of the U.S. PC market fell to 5.4 percent, according to market researcher Dataquest Inc. Counting sales of Mac clones, the Macintosh has 7.2 percent of the market. By raising its licensing fees, Apple would hamper the growth of the clone makers and discourage software companies from developing products for the Macintosh, said Matt Sargent, an analyst at market researcher Computer Intelligence InfoCorp in San Diego.

"Canada's venerable Eaton's department store chain, under bankruptcy protection, said on Wednesday it placed 31 of 85 stores under review as U.S. vulture brokerages swooped down on its C$150 million (US$110 million) supplier debt. Toronto-based T. Eaton Co. Ltd., Canada's fifth largest chain with annual sales of C$1.67 billion (US$1.22 billion), said it would renegotiate leases for the stores under review, as part of restructuring plan it filed on February 27. Eaton's is expected to eventually close some of the stores under review as it tries to grapple with its mounting losses in Canada's competitive retail market. The 127-year-old retailer owned by one of Canada's richest families, the Eatons, owes C$150 million (US$110 million) to suppliers and another C$160 million (US$118 million) to two of the nation's largest banks, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank. Eaton's has seen up to C$40 million ($29 million) of its C$150 million ($110 million) supplier debt snapped up by U.S. vulture brokerages, the firm said on Wednesday. The brokerages are trading the debt at a discount on behalf of their clients. The U.S. brokerages are using names on their lists of suppliers garnerned from previous bankruptcy protection filings, such as Canadian clothing retailer Dylex Ltd.. Suppliers, eager to recoup some of their claims as soon as possible, sold their debt at a range of 50 to 81 percent of the dollar, they said. Bear Stearns' Director of Bankruptcy and Research, David Goldburg, guessed that up to C$40 million ($29 million) has been bought. BDS Securities Senior Managing Director Scott Donahue said his firm has bought between C$13 million ($9.5 million) to C$15 million ($11 million) which in turn has been sold to clients who trade it. Donahue said that the market has likely topped out at offers of C$0.81 on the dollar, since the Eaton family may demand its suppliers to shave something off their demands to be paid in full. ""You have to assume that if the Eaton family risked their equity stake in this venerable old chain by filing under CCAA (Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act), they're going to try to get the unsecured claimants to take some kind of haircut,"" Donahue said. Donahue also said the Eaton family, which consists of four brothers and their offspring, will have to work very hard to cut corporate expenses which is typically easier for outsiders. ""For 85 stores, it's dramatically higher than you would expect it to be, which is not so unusual in family owned and operated companies,"" he said. ""A lot of Eatons in the trough."" Eaton's might stretch out its time frame to reorganize and pay creditors, which would cut into the traders' profits. ""At these levels you're not allowing yourself much margin for error,"" Bright said. But the U.S. vultures are not interested in pushing Eaton's into bankruptcy, Donahue said. ""They would prefer to be passive investors"" and eventually reap value, he said. ((lydia.zajc@reuters.com, Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8109)) ","LydiaZajc"
"Modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp's stock soared Wednesday on talk that it may be close to unveiling a faster analog modem. Skokie, Illinois- based U.S. Robotics told an Oppenheimer &amp; Co investors conference Tuesday that it is looking at developing new technologies including higher speed modems. The company has previously said that it did not believe 33.6 kilobits per second was the fastest speed for modems. While the company did not say whether it had developed a faster modem, an Oppenheimer analyst said the presentation on the subject was more elaborate than discussions on the topic in the past. ""This is the first time they've ever discussed this with some slides and everything,"" Oppenheimer analyst Steven Levy said.  ""To the extent there is one, it's probably not too far away."" Meanwhile, Rockwell International Corp's semiconductor systems unit said late Tuesday it expects to demonstrate 56 kilobit transmission capabilities at a trade show in November. That added to sentiment that such a modem, which would speed Internet communication over standard telephone lines, was more than just theory, analysts said. Analysts said U.S. Robotics has about an 80 percent share of the modem market for online services and a 38 percent share for desktop modems that connect users with those services. If U.S. Robotics can quickly market a faster modem, it could help the company hold or improve that share, as there is no standardization at the 56 kilobit level, analysts said. In other words, Rockwell and U.S. Robotics' modems don't ""talk"" to each other. ""Clearly we have an issue of standardization process that will take time and during that time, there's an opportunity for the company to be the only supplier,"" said Rakesh Sood, analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist. U.S. Robotics would not comment about whether it was close to releasing a faster modem. The stock was up 4-3/8 to 56-7/8 on Nasdaq Wednesday. Rockwell International stock rose 1/4 to 54-1/8 in NYSE trading.

"U.S.-based Unisys Corp said on Tuesday it had appealed to the Czech Economic Competition Office against a Defence Ministry decision awarding an army contract to a consortium of Electronic Data Systems and Digital Equipment Corp. ""Unisys has submitted...a proposal for investigation of the decision of the Defence Minister of the Czech Republic,"" the company said in a statement. Last week, Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny rejected a first round appeal by Unisys and IBM Corp saying he believed his decision in March to award a 1.3 billion crown army information system deal to EDS-Digital was correct. Installation of the staff information system is seen as a large step on the Czech army's path to compatibility with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's military command. Vyborny chose EDS-Digital despite a recommendation by a steering committee to chose Unisys's bid. ""By this step (the appeal), Unisys is continuing in its effort for recognition of its victory in the public tender...because it is convinced of the seriousness of its arguments,"" the statement said. Vyborny has said that he decided in favour of EDS-Digital due to the lower price of its bid. Unisys has said that price was not weighted in accordance with the tender rules, and that EDS-Digital's offer was not complete. EDS declined to comment. Unisys won an original four billion crown supply tender last year, but it was cancelled in August when competition authorities found irregularities in the process. Vyborny said after the second tender that the ministry had decided to ignore the recommendation of the tender committee also because some members' evaluations were far different than the rest of the committee. Unisys has said it was suspicious that the original tender was abolished and rankings were changed when it won again. ""Unisys is proposing cancellation of the decision and hopes the government of the Czech Republic will deal with the situation around this strategic order,"" Unisys added. A number of other Czech military tenders have been marked by controversy, sometimes including allegations of graft.

"Earthgrains Co, the baked goods concern spun off less than a year ago by beer brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc, aims to expand geographically through acquisitions in a consolidating industry. ""How fast we do it will depend on how those properties become available and what we have to pay for them. But we are looking for geographic expansion through acquisitions,"" Chairman Barry Beracha said in an interview . Earthgrains made a presentation at an analyst conference here.   Earthgrains serves about 35 percent of the U.S. population with a presence in the Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and Far West. The company, which was shed in March 1996, made a few acquisitions in late 1996 in Mississippi, West Virginia and Texas. Those deals helped expand Earthgrains' reach and took some excess capacity out of the baking industry. ""The key for us is to use the industry consolidation as a way to improve our profitability and improve shareholder value and not just get bigger,"" Beracha said.   While geographic expansion through acquisitions will be the main driver of Earthgrains' future growth, Beracha said the company is also looking to increase revenues, including with new products. The company, which is the third-largest producer of fresh baked goods with brands like IronKids, recently launched fresh bagels under its Earth Grains brand. It is also testing other products, all of which fall in the higher end of the bread and baked goods category.   Earthgrains sees a greater willingness for consumers to pay more for products that promise better flavor or enhanced nutrition. Beracha pointed to recent sales data that showed per capita bread consumption in pounds is flat, but sales revenues are up. Earthgrains, which also produces refrigerated dough in both the United States and Europe and has a European bakery operation, posted third quarter sales of $523 million. Adjusting for facilities and businesses that were closed or sold, sales rose 3.9 percent. On the profit side, Earthgrains posted a dramatic turnaround, with third quarter earnings of $0.91 a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $0.91 a share before extraordinary items.

"Congress is gearing up to try and make changes to the way the government auctions the airwaves, following a recent sale that fell flat and a new Justice Department investigation into possible bid-rigging. Lawmakers said Thursday they are eyeing bills or offering legislation to maximize the money the federal government raises through spectrum sales. That comes after some wireless communications licenses auctioned last week feteched just $1 apiece, and the antitrust probe put a further tarnish on the sales. Bills being offered would set minimum bidding levels or slow the flow of airwave slices into the market by holding federal auctions only at selected intervals. The Clinton administration is studying the measures. Congress has relied heavily on the Federal Communications Commission auctions as a one-time way to help cut the deficit. ""We had a great success with the early auctions that raised over $23 billion. But it became like candy. And the budgeteers just couldn't put it down,"" Representative Mike Oxley, an Ohio Republican who first introduced auction legislation in 1993, said in an interview. ""At the very least, we ought to have some hearings and try to educate members (of Congress), the public, and particularly the budgeteers, that they're really playing with fire here."" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who chairs the commerce committee, wants the FCC to pay ""more attention to the market forces"" when it auctions spectrum for uses ranging from a new generation of cellular phones to satellite television. ""The last thing we want to do is have a distortion of the marketplace which would then cost people involved in the free enterprise system and the taxpayers,"" he said in an interview. McCain is preparing to offer a bill to keep spectrum from being dumped on the market. But some analysts are wary of tinkering with the process. ""The idea that Congress can figure whether there's too much or too little spectrum -- or the right price -- I find arrogant and presumptuous,"" said Bill Bane, director at Mercer Management Consulting Inc. The importance of airwave sales to the budget process was driven home by last week's disappointing auction. The sale -- for a piece of spectrum that will let users gain access to the Internet or create wireless local telephone networks -- raised just $13.6 million. That was a far cry from the $1.8 billion Congress was counting on to cut the deficit. FCC officials blamed the results on lawmakers' requirement to hold the auction by mid-April and to end it in time to help reduce red ink in the current 1997 fiscal year. They said companies did not have enough time to develop business plans. ""This was a good example of one that was ordered prematurely,"" Representative W. J. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee, said in an interview.     ""It's a problem that has to do with our budgeteers ordering auctions that may be inappropriate, not with the auction process itself,"" added the Louisiana Republican.     Sen. Robert Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, offered a bill this week to set a minimum price for each airwave parcel sold. ""With a reserve pricing system, taxpayers will be guaranteed that national assets are not sold for a song,"" he said.     Meanwhile, lawmakers are in no hurry to offer bills in response to the Justice Department probe of possible bid-rigging at auctions for advanced cellular-phone licenses. But the news put a further spotlight on the auctions.     ""This whole topic of spectrum auctions has become -- crazily enough -- kind of sexy,"" quipped House Commerce Committee aide Dennis Fitzgibbons. ","RogerFillion"
"The El Nino weather pattern developing in the Pacific could damage West African cocoa crops, but the extent of any losses is hard to predict because of local weather and crop patterns, industry analysts said on Thursday. ""Sometimes it has effects on yields and sometimes it doesn't,"" said one crop analyst, referring to seven other El Nino events since one of the most damaging in 1976. On Tuesday the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said weather in the Pacific had triggered an El Nino weather pattern that would probably affect world crops. Cocoa futures for July contracts spiked at a new high of 1,085 stg a tonne in London trading on Thursday but long-term price effects would depend on traders' views on supply deficits into 1997/98 (Oct/Sept). El Nino is the name given to a reversal of ocean water circulation in the southern Pacific. The phenomenon, which scientists say is becoming more common, is generally associated with droughts in parts of Africa, Australia, Indonesia and South America. In more northerly countries, El Ninos can spell rain. El Nino cut Nigerian 1976/77 cocoa production from a possible 220,000 tonnes to around 160,000 tonnes, with Ghana's crop cut to around 330,000 tonnes from 412,000, say analysts. ""El Nino can cause enormous havoc. Depending on when it hits it can affect one or two years' main crop,"" one analyst told Reuters in Abidjan. Ivory Coast was largely unaffected in 1976/77 as widespread tree plantings offset El Nino damage, leaving a stable crop trend. A second wave of prolonged El Nino damage arose between 1982 and 1984, when bush fires caused by abnormally dry weather swept through Ivorian plantations. ""In 1992/93 yields were good so prices were not seriously affected,"" said one analyst. Collapsing Eastern European consumption after the fall of the Berlin Wall coupled with plentiful world stocks had dampened supply fears, he added. ""Now there is a deficit forecast and consumption is again expanding in Asia,"" he said. UK-based trader ED &amp; F Man in its May report said, ""Unless the weather in West Africa improves, the cocoa market faces a substantial drawdown in stocks in 1997/98"". Man forecasts a supply deficit of 125-150,000 tonnes by the end of the 1996/97 season and a 34 percent rise in world grindings to 2,795,000 tonnes. Other analysts say it is too early to guess the effects of the El Nino. ""If the El Nino develops and hits in late 1997 there will be no effect on the cocoa. The main crop (Oct-April) will already be on the trees,"" one said. ""(It) would only affect next year's mid-crop (May-Sept)."" One crop analyst said scant rains in the 1993/94 crop year (Oct-Sept) resulted from El Nino weather but failed to damage crops because thick cloud cover over West Africa prevented a drop in soil moisture. Heavy rains have fallen throughout Ivory Coast over the past three weeks. ""People have not got terribly excited about it in the past,"" he added, referring to the effects of the previous El Nino reported in 1994. ""Futures may now be rising as people take on insurance cover but that stock can easily be dumped back into the market later if necessary."" -- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"China Thursday ordered two 747 airliners from aviation giant Boeing Co. in a multimillion dollar deal that Washington's ambassador to China said was hastened by upcoming visits by U.S. congressmen. The jets will be powered by engines from Pratt and Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp., and were scheduled for delivery in 1999 to Air China, Beijing's international carrier, officials of the China Aviation Supplies Corp. said. Closure of the $383 million contract, which follows the purchase of three 747-400s by Air China in July last year, had been hastened by imminent visits to Beijing of about 35 U.S. congressmen, said U.S. Ambassador James Sasser. ""This Boeing contract is something that has been under discussion for some time,"" Sasser told reporters. ""Clearly there was an effort to try to finalise this transaction on the eve of the visit of a number of senators and congressmen."" One official bipartisan delegation of around 22 congressmen is scheduled to arrive in Beijing next week for talks with Chinese officials that are expected to include touchy issues such as the Sino-U.S. trade balance and human rights. Relations between Washington and Beijing have long been battered by disputes over trade, Taiwan, copyright piracy and China's human rights record, but both sides say ties warmed in the latter half of 1996. Chinese efforts to ease Beijing's swelling and highly sensitive trade surplus with the United States were likely to provide a boost to U.S. exports to China, Sasser said. ""I think you will see over the coming months an effort on the part of the Chinese to make additional purchases of U.S. goods, in an effort to try to even up as much as possible the present trade deficit with the United States,"" he said. The United States says it has a trade deficit with China, reaching nearly $29 billion in the first nine months of last year. Beijing insists that its customs figures show a surplus in favour of the United States. The ambassador declined to give details of the deals likely to be agreed upon or to say which sectors might benefit most. Some U.S. businessmen say high-profile sales are among the earliest casualties of Sino-U.S. diplomatic spats, and Boeing has in the past hinted that it has lost deals to European archrival Airbus Industrie for political reasons. Boeing officials at the Thursday signing declined to comment on whether the 747 contract had been hastened by the recent thawing in cross-Pacific ties, but Arthur Abel, Regional Director for Aircraft Contracts, said the deal was heartening. ""We are just very encouraged and optimistic about our long-term relationship with China,"" he told Reuters. A Boeing statement said the two 286-passenger 747 Combis it would supply to Air China marked a strong vote of confidence from an airline that already operated 45 of Boeing's aircraft. Officials of the state-run China Air Supplies Corp. also welcomed the deal, although they identified the ordered aircraft as 301-seat 747-400s. ","MureDickie"
"Chrysler Corp. will report record earnings for 1996, based on record worldwide sales of 2.97 million vehicles, company chairman Robert Eaton said Tuesday. ""We're going to have a record year,"" Eaton said in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show. Chrysler's previous annual profit record came in 1994, when the company earned $3.713 billion. It earned $2.025 billion in 1995, when sales were held to 2.61 million units by the launch of its current line of minivans. Eaton also said Chrysler in 1997 should be able to exceed its 1996 sales results because the company will be able to produce about 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than in 1996. The increase will be come from added capacity for the new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle in Newark, Del., as well as increased assembly line speeds for the Dodge Ram pickup truck in St. Louis, and increased production of Dodge Dakota pickup trucks in Warren, Mich. Chrysler planned to unveil the Durango at the Detroit auto show later Tuesday. Eaton said despite sluggish industrywide car sales and the increasing popularity and profitability of light trucks, the automaker has not cut back on investment in future car programmes. He said, however, that Chrysler may shift its investment plans if trucks continued to gain market share. ""We're going to put the money where the market goes,"" he said, adding that new, more efficient truck engines should allow Chrysler to continue to increase truck capacity without violating federal fuel economy laws. Eaton also said Chrysler has tentatively planned to add a third production shift to its Bramalea, Ontario, car assembly plant after it launches production of a new generation of LH family sedans later this year. The LH line includes the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and LHS and Eagle Vision, which also are expected to be introduced at the show. Chrysler stock dropped 12.5 cents to $35.50 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading. ","DavidLawder"
"The stock of International Business Machines Corp. fell in heavy trading on Thursday, hit by renewed fears about its first-quarter earnings after a published report focused on recent analysts' estimate cuts. The sell-off fuelled the overall stock market's fourth sharp sell-off in five days as investors were already scared that Friday's March employment report, if robust, could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again soon. IBM fell as low as $128.875 before ending down $2.375 at $131.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the third most-active issue on volume of 4.6 million shares. IBM shares began their tumble in London, where investors first read a Wall Street Journal article that said analysts may not be through cutting IBM's earnings estimates. The report talked about a recent spate of analysts' estimate cuts, citing fears that a stronger dollar and a mainframe product transition will hurt IBM's first-quarter earnings, due April 23, and depress the stock even further. A strong dollar makes sales overseas worth less in dollar terms. As previously reported, two weeks ago three Wall Street firms made negative comments and two lowered their estimates on IBM, fuelling a drop in IBM's shares in late March. The report, which appeared as a ""Heard on the Street"" column in Thursday's Journal, also dredged up an almost two-week old rumour that IBM was going to pre-announce that its earnings would come in below analysts' estimates. ""The Wall Street Journal article today is a summation of old news,"" said John Jones of Salomon Brothers. ""We talked to IBM today and they have no plans for a pre-announcement."" One trader said of the newspaper article: ""They are a bit late to the party here."" ""I heard the rumour but I wouldn't put any credence to it,"" said another trader. An IBM spokesman declined to comment on the quarter. As previously reported, on March 21, Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich cut IBM's 1997 earnings estimate to $12.30 a share from $12.50. For all of 1996, IBM earned $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share. On March 20, Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Jay Stevens lowered his first-half earnings estimates for IBM, saying customers might hold off purchases of mainframes until an anticipated upgrade. Some analysts are expecting initial shipments in June. Stevens added to his estimates for the second half of the year, however, saying the year would be more back-end loaded, as customers make purchases in the second half of the year. Also in March, Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh said it would be tough for IBM's first-quarter earnings, which it estimated at $2.32 a share, to compare to the year-ago period's. The analysts' consensus estimate is $2.31 a share for the first quarter, according to First Call, which tracks estimates. For the first quarter of 1996, IBM posted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $2.48 a share, excluding charges associated with software acquisitions and other special items. Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst, said he is maintaining his first-quarter earnings estimate of $2.32 a share, which he has had since February. ""It's going to be tough to make that number and I doubt that they can overachieve it,"" Helmig said. But he added that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed drastically since February, so he sees nothing new to affect his estimates. The IBM drop caused the Dow Jones industrial average to lose 39.66 points to end at 6,477.35 after an initial plunge of more than 80 points. ","TheresePoletti"
"The Beijing-appointed committee handling Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule wrapped up a two-day session in Beijing on Saturday with an endorsement of China's plans to scrap some civil liberties after the takeover. Just one of the 150 members of the Preparatory Committee voted against the motion to approve Beijing's plans to scrap or rewrite sections of Hong Kong's statute book after it regains control of the British colony on July 1 this year. A further 10 members abstained. ""I do not agree with the abolishing of some of the ordinances, which include the Bill of Rights ordinances and the public order ordinance,"" said Frederick Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, who cast the sole dissenting vote. On Friday Fung had handed a letter to Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen protesting against Beijing's proposed changes, such as rolling back on rights and on public assembly. ""They were talking about striking out the laws, which I could not agree to because I could not find anything that is contradictory to the Basic Law,"" said Allen Lee, chairman of the pro-China, pro-business Liberal Party, who abstained. Hong Kong's post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa, who attended the crucial committee meeting in Beijing, supported the moves, saying the liberties of the territory's 6.3 million people were already enshrined in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law. ""I think things are being done in a very orderly, proper manner,"" Tung told reporters on Saturday. ""The Basic Law explicitly provides freedom and our rights."" However, Tung stressed Hong Kong's right to make its own decisions after it elects a legislature in 1998. ""After 1998 we are masters of our own house, we can decide what is right for ourselves, what is right for our community."" Beijing's plans to repeal or amend 25 of Hong Kong's laws and ordinances, including parts of the Bill of Rights as well as regulations on public assembly, have prompted protests from Britain and democracy activists in the colony. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten called the committee's decision to back the measures ""disturbing"". ""Once again we have the impression of legal arguments hastily thrown together, policies made up as we go along,"" Patten said in a statement following the vote. Washington has expressed concern over the proposed changes. Britain has summoned the Chinese ambassador to lodge a protest and Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind plans to pursue the issue at a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Qian next month. China has defended the move, saying only that those provisions that contradict laws dealing with international affairs or national defence will be removed. Following the Preparatory Committee's motion to recommend Beijing's planned legal changes for the colony, the proposals will now go to China's National People's Congress, its rubber-stamp parliament, for ratification, Tung said. He gave no timetable. The 25 laws and articles to be repealed or altered include some that are the product of recent British-led reforms while others are the trappings of the colonial era. The committee also voted to legitimise Tung's pre-handover official work and that of the controversial provisional legislature, hand-picked by Beijing to replace an elected body. It supported a measure granting Tung the authority to decide whether some incumbent civil servants would serve after the handover and the power to appoint more members to municipal and district bodies, a move critics say will dilute the voice of Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp.

"Kellogg Co., in a move to broaden its breakfast food business and help offset sluggish cereal sales, said Monday it will acquire the Lender's Bagels business from Kraft Foods Inc. for $455 million. Lender's, based in White Plains, N.Y., is the nation's largest maker of fresh and frozen bagels sold in grocery stores, with annual sales of about $275 million. Kraft is owned by Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the New York-based food and tobacco giant. ""Lender's Bagels is a perfect fit for Kellogg Company's fast-growing convenience foods business,"" Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said. ""With our heritage based in nutrition and our technical competence in grain-based food products, adding the nation's number one brand in bagels ... offers substantial new opportunities to grow our business,"" he said in a statement. Analysts said the deal would extend Kellogg's reach into America's breakfast pantry by moving it into the fast-growing bagel business, with sales estimated at about $2.8 billion a year. In addition to being the world's largest maker of ready-to-eat breakfast cereal, Kellogg also makes Pop-Tarts toaster pastries, Eggo frozen waffles and Nutri-Grain breakfast bars. ""It's a good fit in that it is a breakfast business,"" said Salomon Brothers analyst Nomi Ghez. ""It recognises that the cereal market has matured, and other areas are eating into it. They have to move into those other areas."" The deal, expected to close by year-end, includes Lender's plants in New Haven, Conn.; Mattoon, Ill., and Buffalo, N.Y., Kellogg said. But the acquisition is not big enough to halt the erosion in Kellogg's mainstay cereal business, analysts said. Price cuts of about 19 percent this year have failed to boost demand, and Kellogg's cereal sales fell as much as 15 percent in the third quarter due to stiff competition, they said. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Monday cut its ratings outlook for $1.3 billion in Kellogg corporate debt to negative from stable because it believes the company will have difficulty in recapturing lost sales and improving profits. Kellogg's earlier this month warned that its first quarter 1997 profits will likely fall below the year-earlier results. Kellogg stock fell 12.5 cents to $68.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. At a price of more than 1.5 times Lender's sales, the acquisition will depress Kellogg's earnings slightly in 1997, Ghez estimated. It should boost profits in 1998, she said. Joseph Stewart, Kellogg's senior vice president of corporate affairs, said the company sees long-term growth prospects for Lender's Bagels, which has 45 percent of the nation's prepackaged bagel market. ""This is a long-term positive proposition to build shareholder value,"" Stewart said. Kraft, based in Northfield, Ill., is the nation's largest packaged food company with revenues of $16 billion. Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., has annual sales of about $7 billion. ","DavidLawder"
"Australian government-owned Telstra Corp reported a 38.4-percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half as the costs of shedding almost a third of its workforce started to ring up for the telephone carrier. Telstra, which is to be partially privatised by the end of the year, also said it was in talks with global telecom carriers about forming possible alliances. ""We are dancing with everyone, but we haven't taken anyone home from the dance yet,"" chief executive officer Frank Blount told reporters after the results announcement. The Australian carrier reported a net profit after abnormals of A$742.0 million (US$585.4 million) in the six months to December 31, 1996, compared with A$1.20 billion a year ago. Redundancy costs were A$1.03 billion in the half-year period with staff levels down by 7,000 during the half to about 69,500. Under Telstra's plan announced last September about 22,000 jobs are to go by the end of fiscal 1998/99. Revenue grew by 4.6 percent to A$7.77 billion in the December half. Blount said first-half revenue was pressured by a slowing economy and increased competition. It was unlikely revenue would grow any faster for the rest of the year to June 30, 1997, Blount said. ""I think the economy is picking up, but we are still seeing softness in revenue, but it is still growing about the same level as in the first half,"" Blount told reporters. Telstra is to face stiffer competition in 1997/98 due to the deregulation of the local telecommunications markets from July 1, 1997, although few foreign telecom groups so far have openly stated they would enter the Australia market. British Telecom Plc (BT) and U.S. telecom giant AT&amp;T Corp have, however, been tipped to enter the local market. Blount said Telstra had been in talks with BT and its partner MCI Communications Corp, AT&amp;T Corp and the Global One consortium about possible alliances. ""We have had talks with Global One...we have had talks with AT&amp;T...and we have continuing talks with BT/MCI,"" Blount said. Excluding the abnormal losses, Telstra reported a 16.1-percent rise in net profit to A$1.40 billion. The result was well received by the Australian government, which said the partial Tesltra float is still on for the end of 1997. The government gets to pocket A$625 million in dividend payments from the carrier. ""I think the company is very well placed for privatisation,"" communications minister Richard Alston told reporters in Canberra. ""We're still hopeful that (the sale) will occur before the end of the calendar year,"" Alston said The government last year moved to sell one-third of Telstra for a projected A$8.0 billion, but recent estimates put the sale price much higher. Telstra is spending about A$3.5 billion on the rollout of its cable network around Australia, which carries its pay television service Foxtel that it owns jointly with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd. Telstra's share of losses from Foxtel in the half was A$49 million, finance director Paul Rizzo told reporters. ""I am not concerned about the losses of Foxtel, because they are not that far off track, they are very close to plan,"" Blount said. ""Of course we are having losses in pay TV, that is the business,"" he said. A$=US$0.7890 ","KevinMorrison"
"Whatever the worries about Hong Kong's return to China this year, business isn't one of them. At least, that's the official line. ""With 100 days to go, it's no big deal from the point of view of business. It's a fait accompli,"" said Stewart Aldcroft, director at Templeton. But scratch the surface of Hong Kong's international business community, and niggling doubts emerge. ""Our half (of one country, two systems) is that Hong Kong will retain its present way of life. And I think that remains to be seen,"" Brigadier Christopher Hammerbeck, executive director at the British Chamber of Commerce, said, rather stiffly. March 23 will marks the 100-day countdown to the handover to China at midnight on June 30, a date dismissed by most corporate types in party-mad Hong Kong as another opportunity to dress up and play hard. That's because the actual business of the handover was taken care of years ago. Ever since Deng Xiaoping flung open China's doors to foreign investment in the late 1970s, Hong Kong has been forging ties with the mainland, actively investing from Guangzhou to Shanghai and building bridges to Beijing with joint ventures, franchises and huge infrastructure projects. China has reciprocated by listing state enterprises on Hong Kong's stock exchange, investing heavily in the territory's hot property market and establishing a firm Hong Kong foothold for the People's Liberation Army, parts of which have been reinvented as vibrant business machines. MAINLAND INTERESTS ""There are many, many companies registered in Hong Kong that are primarily owned and backed by mainland interests,"" said Tai Ming Cheung, analyst at Kim Eng Securities. Then there are the red chips, companies listed and based in Hong Kong but operating in China, whose 15-year success story bodes so well that their sizzling shares have helped fuel a stunning 22-percent rise in Hong Kong stocks over the past year. The bellwether property market has risen more than 40 percent in the same period, turning many Hong Kong residents into instant millionaires. At the same time, the economy is steaming along with growth rates of five percent or more. And while inflation shows signs of re-emerging, it is not yet cause for serious concern. Relief from pent-up inflationary pressure was only one of the many benefits bestowed upon Hong Kong by an open China, whose land and resources provided welcome expansionary room for the territory's frenzied but constrained economy 15 years ago. Economists said the economic integration between Hong Kong and Southern China is now virtually complete, with labour mobility the only remaining division in a vast, sprawling metropolis stretching from Hong Kong to Shenzhen and beyond. ""Harsh economics have driven it, the realities of the cheapness of labour north of the border,"" said Hammerbeck. THE POLITICS, HOWEVER, ARE DELICATE Experts warned that while borders are clear, the line between economics and politics is finely-drawn and easily overstepped. ""People are already politically pessimistic. They are already politically sensitive. It is the economic performance that holds them together,"" said Michael DeGolyer, political analyst at the University of Hong Kong. While Hong Kong's booming stock and property markets indicate high confidence about the territory's commercial fate under China, big business is quietly but keenly alert to any challenge to the features that made Hong Kong one of the great business wonders of the world. Rule of law, free markets, free flow of information, tight fiscal control and strong education are an oft-repeated mantra by a business community determined to protect what it views as the essential ingredients in Hong Kong's magic formula. The ""one country, two systems"" policy devised by Deng to guide Hong Kong's return to the Motherland guarantees the territory's autonomy, but it has yet to be implemented or tested. Its success is crucial. ""Because we haven't yet reached the post-handover period, we have not yet seen the extent to which (future chief executive) Tung Chee-hwa and thus, also, the future Hong Kong government can exert their independence,"" said Templeton's Aldcroft. TUNG ON A TIGHTROPE Tung's task to uphold a capitalist system inherently at odds with China's communist regime is a balancing act few envy, even though most big business in Hong Kong has banked heavily on his ability to pull it off. Tung's decision to leave the the territory's team of civil servants virtually intact was greeted warmly, but China's plan to repeal some civil liberties laws was viewed with caution. ""If we get rid of these laws so promptly, what other laws are going to be got rid of because they're inconvenient? That does not give confidence. But at the same time, we must not make too many assumptions,"" Aldcroft said. While the handover's success is considered more assured in Hong Kong than overseas, the Hong Kong stock market is over-bought. Recent consolidation has removed some of the froth, but enough funds are sufficiently overweight to cause disruption should anything ""go wrong,"" said David Semple, regional strategist at Peregrine Asset Management in Hong Kong. ""There is very negative sentiment from the United States,"" he said. ""And if it does go wrong, there will be a very large element of 'I told you so'."" ","SarahDavison"
"While Internet stocks have taken center stage in the investment arena alongside such high-tech stalwarts as Intel Corp and Cisco Corp, many investors are wary about what 1997 will bring. Tech sector stocks have sagged amid uncertainty over the 1997 market outlook. With growth of the PC market expected to moderate further despite a strong business upgrade cycle, investment in technology stocks is shifting somewhat towards value investing from momentum players,  according to some investors and analysts at the annual Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. technology conference here. ""People are still suffering from too much money  and too much volatility and they're not sure when it's all going to stop,"" said Keith Benjamin, a Robertson Stephens senior research analyst covering Internet media content and services companies. Investors also said they are being more selective than a year ago, when Internet stocks were the rage and bankers joked that you could write ""Internet"" on a dollar bill and take it public for $10. ""Investors are looking for stable revenue streams here, annuity-type businesses,"" said one investor for a European fund. Some investors also expressed frustration at the process of sifting through myriad business plans -- some 70 of the more than 350 companies presenting here this week were Internet related, many taking the center stage over more established firms. ""I don't think they have any idea what their business plan is,"" said another investor, shaking his head as he left the room after a presentation of one well-known Internet startup. ""There are very few opportunities and so much money out there looking for them,"" said Robert Herwick, head of Herwick Capital Management, noting the recent sell-off in networking stocks could also have repercussions for shares of hot chip-makers supplying the communications market. Many of these fast-growing companies had held their value last year despite the slump in the rest of the semiconductor sales at the time amid a flood of new semiconductor capacity and Herwick says investors may even be experiencing a bottoming of high tech sentiment now. Despite some bullish comments about spot prices of 16-megabit computer memory chips by companies like Micron Technologies Inc., which said this week spot prices for the chips have risen 50 percent in recent weeks, executives remain cautious. Micron's chairman, Steven Appleton, warned that although markets exaggerate the up and down cycles of the semiconductor business, it is folly to ever believe these swings will disappear. Likewise, Herwick said some semiconductor executives are worried about further capacity coming on-line despite the apparent efforts of Korean chipmakers to curb output, and this could impact pricing for the next-generation  64-bit memory chips in the second half. Several of the Internet companies stressed, as they had in their initial share offering documents, that they have limited operating histories and are focused foremost on gaining market share and revenues. ""There's one thing on our minds, and that's revenue,"" said Bruce Wilson, executive vice president of CyberCash, Inc., at a presentation late Thursday. Further consolidation is expected in the Internet space. The on-line chat company iChat noted in its presentation here that 99 percent of all Internet traffic is already commanded by less then one percent of all sites, and others said this concentration is only expected to increase. Forrester Research CEO George Colony said he expects many leaders in existing physical markets will successfully enter and dominate the on-line world as well, over time. Referring to Amazon.com, the Seattle-based Internet bookseller which currently runs one of the hottest Internet merchant sites, Colony said established companies may yet come to dominate space. ""Do you think three to four years from now Amazon.com will be a major brand?"" he asked in a panel discussion this week. ""I call them Amazon.toast."" In an apparently unrelated decision, Amazon.com, the company, canceled its presentation at the conference, Robertson Stephens announced.

"The French government said on Tuesday it was ready to relaunch the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF and appointed key executives to oversee the sale. ""The government has just taken the decisions necessary for the privatisation of Thomson-CSF to enter the operational phase,"" the industry and finance ministries said in a joint statement. An attempt to sell the whole Thomson electronics group last year floundered when the independent Privatisation Commission rejected the sale of parent company Thomson SA to the missiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere Groupe for a symbolic one franc. The government said on Tuesday it would make Marcel Roulet, formerly chairman of both Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF, responsible for the sale of the defence subsidiary on a full-time basis. He will now only be chairman of Thomson-CSF. It also appointed Thierry Breton, formerly a deputy chairman of French computer maker Cie des Machines Bull, as chairman of Thomson SA and its wholly-owned consumer electronics unit, Thomson Multimedia (TMM). Breton will be responsible for privatising TMM and will shortly make proposals on the sale, the statement said. ""First of all, it is the signal that the two things are really separate, with two different men who will exclusively work on Thomson-CSF and the handling of the privatisation of TMM,"" an industry ministry official said. ""The second signal is that, effectively, we are relaunching the TMM privatisation with a new head who will soon make proposals to the government on the procedure,"" he added. The government will inject 11 billion francs ($1.9 billion) of fresh capital into TMM by the summer, following approval from the European Commission. TMM, which makes television sets and video cassette recorders, will be sold gradually through an opening up of its capital, the statement said. A source close the deal said the TMM sale would follow the lines of the past Bull privatisation -- a trade sale accompanied by a list of conditions, rather than a stock market flotation. TMM would need sound finances to float on the bourse but is losing money and requires industrial partners who would take a medium-term view rather than stock market investors, who look to the short term, the source said. An industry source said the boards of Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF met on Tuesday morning to discuss the terms and conditions of Thomson-CSF's privatisation. A key objection by the Privatisation Commission to the government's first sale attempt was the planned sale by Lagardere of loss-making TMM to the South Korean Daewoo Electronics group, again for one symbolic franc. Lagardere wanted to retain Thomson-CSF and merge its Matra Defense Espace unit with Thomson to create an integrated defence company with radar, satellite and missile interests. The government has now decided to sell Thomson-CSF, 58 percent owned by Thomson SA, separately from TMM. Detailed terms and conditions are expected to be announced shortly, opening the way for companies to make fresh bids for Thomson-CSF. Both Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom have said they are interested. TMM last week posted a 1996 net attributable loss of 3.1 billion francs, which included hefty provisions for factory closures and the expected loss of up to 10,000 jobs. But it expects to break even at the operating level next year and be profitable from 1999 when U.S. patent revenues come on stream. Thomson-CSF announced last week it returned to profit in 1996 after three years of losses, showing a net attributable profit of 745 million francs. ","PierreTran"
"China's economic tsar has called for tougher controls on financial risk to protect the nation's banking system and set strict guidelines for trimming its huge pile of bad debt. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said state banks, struggling with loans they may never recover, needed to cut bad debt by two percent a year or their top managers could be sacked, the official People's Daily said on Thursday. ""The financial system must make a major push in 1997 to restore financial order and reduce risk,"" Zhu told delegates to the nation's parliament. ""We must seek to reduce the rate of bad loans by two percent annually over the next few years,"" he said. ""We will hold accountable the leaders of those banks that cannot meet the standards."" Zhu, former head of the central bank, has been pushing to insulate banks from speculative investments in real estate as well as the nation's volatile stock and futures markets. He has ordered banks to divorce themselves from trust company subsidiaries that can invest in more speculative markets. He has also pushed hard for banks to extend loans based on the creditworthiness of their customers. Many local governments pressure state banks to lend money to key enterprises that are major employers -- even when they are unlikely to repay. Zhu reminded government officials that the commercial bank law bars local governments from interfering in bank operations. Central bank officials have said as much as 13-14 percent of all loans extended by state-run banks were non-performing. Some big banks might be insolvent if their bad loans were written off, financial analysts say. In January, China announced it had shut the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC), major trust firm, for unspecified irregularities. On Thursday, official newspapers reported that the state would stand behind the debts of CADTIC, repaying principal though it would not pay interest. ","WilliamKazer"
"Avalon Oil Plc said on Monday that it had decided to look to London for funding of its oil exploration joint venture with FAO Gazprom because British investors were ahead of the U.S. in investing in Russian projects. ""The London investment community is probably five years ahead of the U.S. investment community when it comes to Russia,"" Avalon Oil chairman John Wieczorek told Reuters in an interview. ""We couldn't see any Russian ventures which have been taken public in the States."" Oklahoma-based Avalon said earlier on Monday that it intended to seek a listing on Britain's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) to raise funds for Stimul, a joint venture with a Gazprom subsidiary which will exploit oil reserves at Orenburg in southern Russia. The U.S. company is believed to want to raise around 35 million pounds via a placing, which will finance its 49 percent stake in Stimul. Avalon is following an increasingly well-worn path. Other companies such as Melrose, JKX Oil and Gas and Dana xxx have all become involved in projects to develop immense and largely untapped gas and oil reserves in the former Soviet Union, which some say could rival reserves in the Middle East. Wieczorek said Gazprom, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's natural gas production, was keen to use Avalon's portfolio of new technology. The two have been working together since 1993, and Stimul alrady produces 2,850 barrels of oil a day, which it hopes to booost to 18,500 barrels a day next year. ""Gazprom were attracted by access to western technology,""said Wieczorek. ""They have a tremendous history of gas production but not oil production."" Avalon has already introduced different drawing fluids for the extraction of oil which do not damage the reservoirs, and is about to bring in its system of flow drilling, which limits damage during the drilling phase and allows production to start while drilling is going on. This will be the fist time the technique has been employed in Russia. ""You can produce more quickly and you are able to produce at a higher rate. It also reduces the cost of the well,"" said Wieczorek. Without more sophisticated production methods the reserves at Orenburg, which Wieczorek said are similar in scale to the Nelson field in the North Sea, could not be exploited economicallly. Under current plans Stimul will be able to exploit the site by drilling around 160 horizontal producing wells and 50 vertical wells over the next six years. The original Russian plans called for drilling more than 3000 wells. Wieczorek said the Orenburg project would be ""a jumping-off point for other projects in Russia."" He said the company had been looking at three other oil fields, one nearby and two in different regions of Russia. ""I feel very confident that we'll be able to add these to our future agenda,"" he said. Wieczorek said Avalon was unlikely to have to seek further funding beyond the initial placing. ""I don't think we'll have to come back for more because this programme should be cashflow positive in 1999, so from that point of view it should be self-funding,"" he added. ","JonathanBirt"
"China trumpeted the 100-day mark for the recovery of Hong Kong on Sunday and hailed late leader Deng Xiaoping for his guiding role in bringing more than a century of colonial shame to a close. Hundreds of people gathered at midnight near Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing to watch a huge electronic countdown clock as it flashed only 100 days to go before the British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1. Official newspapers covered their front pages with reports of the impending end of British colonial rule as called for under a Sino-British accord signed in 1984. ""We have endured 100 years of shame, 100 years of resistance and 100 years of waiting,"" said the Guangming Daily. ""Now in another 100 days, the hopes of generations will be realised."" The Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, devoted much of its front page to the historic occasion and the role played in it by the nation's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who died last month aged 92 before he could see his dream fulfilled. Deng guided China's negotiations with Britain and is credited with devising the formula of ""one country, two systems"" that allows Hong Kong to keep its capitalist system and a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years. ""At this moment we think even more fondly of Deng Xiaoping,"" said the party newspaper. ""It was he who proposed the great formula of 'one country, two systems' that allowed us to peacefully resolve a thorny question left over from history and realise the complete reunification of our country..."" That praise was echoed by some of the hundreds of people who braved Beijing's chilly night air to watch the countdown clock mark the last 100 days before the transfer of power in Hong Kong. ""This is Deng's contribution,"" said a retired office worker surnamed Chang. ""I am overjoyed."" A huge roar erupted from the crowd at midnight as students waved banners saying, ""China takes the road to strength"" and chanted ""Hong Kong comes home"". ""I'm thrilled,"" said An Na, a student at the Chemical Industry Institute. ""I wish I didn't have to wait 100 days."" China ceded Hong Kong island to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanjing following the Opium War, and Britain later added to its holdings in the area. While China hailed the impending recovery of Hong Kong, it had barely a passing word for the British government that decided to hand back the colony peacefully rather than contest its claim to the territory. The official media also had little to say about China's pledges of a ""high degree of autonomy"" under the joint accord, though it hinted at concerns in Hong Kong and elsewhere. The Shenzhen Special Zone Daily, published in the border boom town of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, tried to reassure residents of Hong Kong about a report on the Chinese army garrison that will be stationed in the territory. ""Don't worry, dear compatriots,"" it advised its readers, without saying what they might have to worry about. The People's Daily similarly sought to deflect concerns. ""More and more people are coming to the belief that the Chinese government is reliable and capable and will faithfully carry out its promises,"" it said. ","WilliamKazer"
"Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Australian-listed stocks slumped five to ten percent on Monday as international investors fearful of a law and order meltdown reacted to the army's attempt to force the PNG government aside. Orogen Minerals Ltd, which is 51 percent owned by the PNG government, was one of the hardest hit, slumping seven percent or 24 cents to A$3.20.  Other stocks jagged as much as ten percent lower in increasingly hectic afternoon trade as reports emerged that the head of the army and the police commissioner had told Prime Minister Julius Chan to resign or be forced aside in two days. The army and police are angry the government has employed mercenaries to help the armed forces subdue seccessionists on Bougainville Island. Brokers and analysts said investors feared an army mutiny and possible civil unrest in the capital Port Moresby would spread to the remote areas where most of PNG's huge gold mines and oil projects are located.   ""The danger is if any local tribes use this dispute as an excuse to act up and this would affect local mining operations,"" said Shaw Stockbroking research director Michael Heffernan. Major mining projects in Papua New Guinea's rugged hinterlands like the giant OK Tedi project, controlled by the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, are often in dispute with local tribal groups. Analysts said investors' need look no further than the now-dormant copper project on Bougainville to see what happens when the central government and armed forces lose control.   The Bougainville Copper mine was shut down in 1989 when rebellious landowners who wanted bigger returns from the project sabotaged the mine and began the current recessionist revolt. ""There's always a certain amount of civil unrest, but if the more militant groups in the regions use this as an excuse to party as it were, it could disrupt operations,"" Heffernan said. Local brokers became increasingly pessimistic through the afternoon, moving in anticipation of an expected selloff by overseas institutional investors.   ""I don't know what the outcome of that (situation) is going to be but it seems to me to be very dismal,"" said broker Kevin Lourey of Melbourne-based brokerage, Peake Lands Kirwan. ""The international reaction to this sort of situation is usually very negative,"" said resources analyst David Walker at broker ABN AMRO Hoare Govett ""The fear is that tonight, particularly on the London exchange, where most of the resource investment in this part of the world comes fron, there will be a strong negative reaction,"" Walker said.   The worst-affected stock in the afternoon rout was oil producer and explorer Oil Search Ltd, which fell 8.5 percent or 24 cents to A$2.60. Bougainville Copper Ltd, which is controlled by RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd fell five cents to 55 cents. Analysts said the government's moves over next day or two would be crucial in limiting any further damage. Prime Minister Chan had yet to respond to the army ultimatum by 0820 GMT. ""The next 24 hours is crucial for the Chan government and also for the value of these investments,"" Walker said.   ""It's important that the situation becomes as clear as it can very quickly in order not only for the stability of the country, but for the value of the investments."" -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800 ","BernardHickey"
"China said on Sunday it expected to reach formal agreement with Tokyo on the details of Japan's latest batch of huge yen loans but warned that politics should not be allowed to get in the way of economic aid. A Japanese mission long delayed by diplomatic tensions reached basic agreement with Chinese officials last month on the projects to receive 180 billion yen ($1.6 billion) earmarked for the first year of Tokyo's 1996-2000 soft loan package. Talks on the loans had been stalled for months, after disputes over territory, history and China's nuclear testing programme chilled ever-sensitive ties, Japanese sources say. ""Japan and China plan to sign a formal contract on the implementation of the 1996 yen loans,"" the official China Daily Business Weekly said in a front-page report. The newspaper did not say when the loans would be finalised but quoted officials of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation as warning politics should not be allowed to intrude on Sino-Japanese economic relations. Some Japanese were trying to use financial assistance to put political pressure on China, but such action was unacceptable and would bring no benefits to Tokyo, it quoted Yu Zhensheng of the ministry's foreign financing administration as saying. ""China is against political conditions attached to economic cooperation,"" Yu said. ""We hope the two sides will make joint efforts to promote the healthy and steady development of Sino-Japanese economic ties."" The loans, scheduled to total 580 billion yen between 1996 and 2000, were a crucial part of the economic relationship, he said. Soft loans from Tokyo are widely seen in China as an unofficial form of reparation for the damage inflicted by Japan's imperial army as it raged across the nation between 1931 and 1945. Sino-Japanese ties have in recent years been strained by differences over nuclear testing, a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to a shrine to his nation's war dead and a territorial dispute over islands in the East China Sea. Japan, the only nation to have suffered atomic attack, last year froze grant-in-aid to China in a largely symbolic protest against Beijing's nuclear testing programme. The far larger yen loans were not officially affected by the nuclear protest, but the November mission was the first since China conducted a nuclear test in May 1995 and Japanese sources say the two issues had been privately linked. Propaganda barrages in Chinese state media keep wartime memories fresh and officials rush to condemn all possible signs of resurgent Japanese militarism, but diplomats say Beijing is keen to avoid threatening a vital economic relationship. Japan had promised 1,610 billion yen worth of loans between 1979 and 1995, accounting for 40 percent of the total foreign government loans promised to China during the period, China Daily Business Weekly said. The loans themselves have been a source of dispute, with the rise in the value of the yen in 1994 and 1995 sending their cost soaring. That prompted Chinese complaints and demands to be allowed to repay in U.S. dollars. Tokyo refused, but the yen's later decline has blunted the issue as a potential source of conflict, and both sides have in recent months shown new willingness to restore amicable ties.

"""Superwoman"" fund manager Nicola Horlick announced her resignation on Thursday from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG), leaving what she called a feeling of ""turmoil"" among fund managers at the German-owned bank. A spokesman for Horlick, who had been head of British pension fund business at DMG's Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), told Reuters she had quit and was planning legal action against her former employer over ""constructive dismissal"". Horlick had been suspended on Tuesday pending the outcome of an internal investigation into what Deutsche Morgan Grenfell described as ""a potential breach of her contract"". The dispute was believed to revolve around allegations Horlick was looking to move and take staff with her. It follows a scandal last year at MGAM over misvaluations in three of its funds and the subsequent sacking of fund manager Peter Young. The suspension of Horlick, dubbed superwoman in financial circles because of her ability to hold a high-powered job while looking after five children, prompted reports of unease among large pension fund clients at the firm. The row erupted only days after Horlick received news of a promotion to managing director from MGAM chief executive Robert Smith, a banking source said. ""They shook hands on it last Friday,"" the source said. Horlick, in an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday, described disquiet at MGAM over the Young affair. She said the promotion came after a group of fund managers who worked under her said they would leave the company unless she be given more authority. ""They demanded that I be given more authority. They felt that things were in turmoil following the Peter Young affair."" Young, currently under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, has denied any involvement in criminal activity. The Horlick saga is said to have unsettled pension fund clients at DMG, but the company said earlier on Thursday that it did not expect any exodus of its pension fund clients. Banking sources also said DMG was confident other fund managers would not follow in Horlick's footsteps and that there was a climate of loyalty to MGAM's Smith. But DMG has been in the spotlight for months over the Peter Young affair, which has been costly as well as embarassing. In December Deutsche Bank agreed to a compensation package of around 200 million pounds ($335 million) to make good losses suffered by investors. Deutsche also saw its coveted triple-A credit rating from Moody's dropped last month. In October Deutsche named Rolf Breuer, a 58-year-old investment banker, as its new head. Breuer will take over on May 20 and is expected to fight hard to avoid the criticism and mistrust that dogged his predecessor Hilmar Kopper. Kopper never managed to shrug off the ""peanuts"" tag attached to him in 1994 after he used the word to describe losses caused by the collapse of the Schneider property empire, with which Deutsche was closely involved. Peanuts are just about the last word the British press have been using in connection with Horlick. She was reported to have earned one million pounds ($1.68 million) a year. In the newspaper interview, she tells of a last attempt to solve things with DMG when she met with Smith on Wednesday. ""The meeting ended up with me in tears and Robert Smith very depressed,"" she was quoted as saying. Horlick said a request to be reinstated was rejected by Smith on Thursday, the FT said. There has been press speculation Horlick was preparing a move to Dutch bank ABN AMRO with others in her team, but ABN has denied any attempt of poaching a fund manager team. It declined to say whether it had tried to hire Horlick. In the interview Horlick said, ""ABN AMRO is a red herring,"" adding: ""I completely concur with what ABN AMRO have said."" --London Newsroom +44 171 542 6784 ","AlexanderSmith"
"Chinese authorities, shaken by a bombing in Lhasa last month, have tightened security across Tibet in the run-up to the Himalayan region's New Year next month, the Tibet Daily said. ""In our region, there is not a single unit or department that can sleep soundly or relax its vigilance in the struggle against separatism,"" Gyamco, a vice-chairman of Tibet's regional government, was quoted as saying in an edition seen in Beijing on Monday. Authorities have launched a manhunt across Tibet and offered a reward of one million yuan ($120,000) for the arrest of those responsible for a bomb set off on Christmas Day outside city government offices in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. No casualties were reported, but the bomb -- the largest so far by anti-Chinese activists in the restive region -- caused widespread damage, shattering windows 100 metres (yards) away, officials have said. Gyamco ordered all departments to be staffed round-the-clock in the run-up to the Tibetan New Year on February 8 and called for vigilance to prevent more acts of sabotage, the newspaper said in its December 28 edition. ""Our struggle against the Dalai Lama clique is an intense and complicated class struggle and an unshirkable political responsibility of leaders at all levels,"" Gyamco said. China blames followers of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, for anti-Chinese unrest that erupts sporadically in the Himalayan region that borders India. The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign to win autonomy for his homeland, says he wants autonomy and freedom of worship in the deeply Buddhist region. He fled China into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule. Several much smaller bombs have been been set off in Lhasa in the past two years, including one in 1995 that slightly damaged a plaque donated by Beijing and another last March outside the headquarters of the Tibet regional government. Lhasa's Communist Party deputy secretary Hou Jianguo vowed to track down the saboteurs responsible for the Christmas Day bombing at all costs, the newspaper said. ""We are determined to solve this case as early as possible and at all costs,"" Hou said. Authorities would continue a campaign to indoctrinate monks and nuns at lamaseries to be ""patriotic"" and pledge allegiance to the Chinese government, the official said. Chinese officials have insisted there was little doubt that the Christmas Day blast was politically motivated and carried out by followers of the the Dalai Lama. Last week, Tibet's government-in-exile in Dharamsala, in northern India, denied the Chinese allegation, saying the bombing could have been carried out by China as an excuse to crack down on dissent. Tibet has been rocked in recent years by sporadic, sometimes violent, anti-Chinese unrest with monks and nuns often at the forefront of demonstrations for independence. The exiled government says it opposes violence and remains committed to a negotiated political settlement. ","BenjaminKangLim"
"A tough price review of British Gas Plc by industry regulator Clare Spottiswoode has heralded a new era for Britain's utility watchdogs as they at last show their teeth, analysts said on Wednesday. Sector watchdogs have borne the brunt of derision and mockery over several years while lucrative utility companies' shares surged, apparently unruffled by regulatory price curbs. Last March, electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild was even forced to reopen a price review on the 12 cash-rich electricity companies, having been embarrassed by the firms' largesse to their investors as they fended off hostile bids. ""It does look like regulators aren't going to have the wool pulled over their eyes any longer,"" said one analyst who declined to be named. ""They're quite astute these days and they are getting pretty wise to these companies."" Consumers, regulators say, will now feel more of the benefits of the controversial privatisation of Britain's gas, water and electricity industries. Spottiswoode went some way on Wednesday towards meeting British Gas's objections to her earlier proposal of a maximum 28 percent cut in the prices charged by TransCo, the British Gas pipeline subsidiary, when she suggested a 20 percent one-off reduction in its charges. But analysts said Spottiswoode had already set a new agenda with her initial proposals in May that sent gas shares plunging. Two subsequent reviews by the power watchdog on Northern Ireland Electricity and National Grid, the power transmission network, have mirrored her unrelenting stance. ""I see May 13 as being a landmark date in terms of regulation,"" said Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Yamaichi. ""That day we saw the first regulator being fairly savage on a company and, above all, actually saying that if you're heavily cash-negative from year to year -- so be it."" Despite British Gas's continued insistence that the planned Transco price curbs could cost the group 10,000 jobs, Spottiswoode's final proposals do show that there is scope during the consultation period to moderate positions. Consumers will nevertheless see gas bills fall by 30 pounds ($46.44) next year, rising to 50 pounds in 2001. There has also already been a 50 pound reduction in bills this year when electricity companies passed on to consumers the money they received from the sale of their National Grid shares. To the outrage of British Gas, Spottiswoode initially proposed a one-off cut of 20-28 percent followed by annual price reductions at a rate of five percent below inflation per year. She now wants Transco to cut prices by only 2.5 percent annually after the first big chop. Some analysts see the group's revenues being reined in by about 400 million pounds per year. ""She's been more lenient than some had expected, but I still think it's a very tough review,"" noted one analyst. Littlechild is proposing cutting the Grid's prices by between 20 and 26 percent next year, followed by a cut in annual prices of four percentage points below inflation. His final proposals will be published in September and until then, the company will be locked in last-minute battles with its regulator. The Grid may see its revenues slashed by about 1.2 billion pounds over four years. But with transmission costs only accounting for seven percent of bills, electricity consumers may get between four and five pounds off annual bills. Northern Ireland Electricity will see 60 million pounds wiped from its revenues. Average household power bills will fall by about 40 pounds in Northern Ireland. Despite the concessions, British Gas still strongly opposes the way its regulator has written down the value of TransCo. So the prospect of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation may still loom. ($1=.6460 Pound) ","KirstinRidley"
"China marked on Saturday the first ""tombsweeping"" day since the death of Deng Xiaoping with few outward signs of remembrance for the late paramount leader. Thousands of Beijing residents streamed through the gates of Babaoshan cemetery for the Qingming festival, traditionally the day for tidying ancestral graves. But for the most part this was a family occasion, far removed from the political limelight that surrounded Deng during his lifetime. ""I have come here every year since my husband died in 1991,"" said a Beijing resident, holding the hand of her granddaughter as they left the cemetery. ""This is a family matter. There is no connection with any political leaders."" A group of students from Deng's native province of Sichuan, all of them enrolled at a university in the Chinese capital, gathered at the cemetery gates. They too had a private reason for being there. ""We are helping a friend sweep his father's grave,"" said one of the students. Deng died on February 19 aged 92. He was cremated at Babaoshan and his ashes scattered at sea in accordance with his wishes. That has left the public with no specific place to honour the man who steered China away from the radical policies of Mao Zedong and onto the path of economic development, even if it meant adopting capitalist ways. Those pragmatic policies raised living standards and turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse. Beijing's central Tiananmen Square has been one such place to honour the nation's fallen heroes but public displays of respect were not encouraged on this day. Early on Saturday, as a group of secondary students walked towards the shrine to martyrs of the revolution at the centre of the square, they were quickly approached by security men. After a brief discussion, they were allowed to bow and then told to leave, witnesses said. China's communist leaders have traditionally planted trees on the Qingming festival and that was how the official media chose to remember Deng. The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, showed photographs of Deng planting trees over the years since 1979, when he began his programme of reforms that changed China's political landscape. ""Now these trees have grown tall,"" said the newspaper. In the spirit of Deng's reforms, vendors of silk flowers were doing brisk business outside the Babaoshan cemetery. Visitors queued up to buy wreaths similar to those that adorned grave sites inside. Deng was in the thoughts of other Beijing residents, such as Bai Lansheng, a sculptor who is working on a bronze statue of the late leader. ""We are getting ready to ship the plaster mould to Shanghai now,"" he said from his Beijing workshop. ""There it will be cast in bronze."" In June the six-metre (20-foot) statue will be shipped to the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders the British colony of Hong Kong. Deng directed negotiations that led to the 1984 Sino-British accord under which the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1. Deng died before the colony's recovery but his statue will gaze across the border and ""witness"" the historic event. ","WilliamKazer"
"Britain's United Utilities may wait two to three years before it earns profits from a contract it won as part of a consortium for water and sewerage services in Manila on Thursday, analysts said. They said it was difficult to assess likely profits until further details of the deal were released, although one who asked not to be named said they could be around five million pounds ($8.17 million) a year. The Manila Water Company (MWC), which comprises United Utilities, Bechtel Corp of the U.S. and local conglomerate Ayala Corp won a contract on Thursday for water supply and sewerage in Manila's east zone. The Philippines government awarded the deal after MWC submitted the lowest water tariff of 2.32 pesos per litre, or 26.3886 percent of the existing fee of 8.78 pesos. Analysts said other groups had bid upwards of 60 percent of the existing tariff in the contract. MWC also posted the lowest bid in the west zone, but that contract was awarded to France's Lyonnaise des Eaux SA and Benpres Holdings Corp, another leading Philippines business group, as the contracts must go to different bidders. United Utilities said in a statement that capital expenditure on the project was expected to be $1.7 billion, while Manila officials are expecting both groups to invest a total of around $7 billion. The concession runs for 25 years and calls on MWC to serve 4.6 million of Manila's population of some 12 million through operating, upgrading and extending the city's water and wastewater systems, United Utilities said. The current clean water system suffers nearly 50 percent losses, United Utilities said. Analysts said the MWC group might be aiming to make cost reductions through staff cuts in order to make the concession profitable, as well as squeezing the amount of water lost. Antonino Aquino, a senior official at Ayala, said the key to making the project economically viable would be to reduce the portion of non-revenue water, caused by leaks or pilfering, which is currently estimated at 58 percent. But analysts said that as United Utilities would focus on running the system once it was upgraded and extended, any benefits would have to wait for a few years. ""United will probably see the benefits after the investment has been made...it could be three to four years before there is any significant contribution,"" said one sector analyst. Shares were down 6-1/2 pence at 671.25 pence by 1441 GMT, while shares in Anglian, which was in a consortium that failed to win either contract were up 7.5 pence at 622 pence. Analysts said that cost cutting and reducing leakage and stolen water could help MWC to wring increasing profits from the deal, even though price tariffs are reportedly fixed for 10 years. ""There are huge savings to be made...the numbers don't look that attractive but the cost savings could help the revenue stream,"" the sector analyst said. The move also fits with UU's aim of developing its non-core businesses, analysts said, where the company hopes international projects could boost profits by 40 million pounds in 2000. But UBS analyst Lakis Athanasiou said on Wednesday that the company could struggle to find extra profits needed to fulfill its promise of 11 percent real dividend growth per year to 2000. ""We think the targets are ambitious,"" he said, adding that UBS expects dividend growth of around six percent per year. ($1=.6119 Pound) ","JoWinterbottom"
"Countries belonging to the World Trade Organization should be flexible and understanding about China's bid to join the WTO, the organization's director-general said on Saturday. ""As we approach the final stage of the Chinese accession process, there is a need for flexibility on all sides and a determination to resolve the crucial outstanding issues in the negotiations,"" Renato Ruggiero told trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. ""The success of this negotiation is a shared responsibility, and it can be assured only if we keep up the momentum established earlier this year,"" Ruggiero said. He said substantial progress is needed on rules issues and market access. The APEC members said they wanted China and Russia to join the WTO quickly, as long as they join on commercially viable terms, officials said. The world's major trading partners have suggested that China join last year's international agreement to open up trade in information technology before it acceeds to the 130-member World Trade Organization. Ruggiero said that talks on financial services have become the WTO's top priority. ""A success in financial services is essential to help ensure each of you -- industrialized and developing countries alike -- the necessary infrastructure growth,"" Ruggiero told the Asia-Pacific trade ministers. ""My message is: do not see this negotiation in North/South terms,"" he continued. ""On the contrary, developing countries whatever their economic position, have an even stronger need than the industrial countries for competitive financial institutions."" Ruggiero urged APEC to make sure a financial services deal is reached this year, to maintain momentum in international trade talks. ""Not to  do so should be as unthinkable as it would be short-sighted,"" Ruggiero said. Last week, the United States, the European Union, Canada and Japan affirmed they would stick to the WTO schedule on financial services by putting forward their offers by mid-July. On Saturday, the 18 APEC countries affirmed their support too, building strong momentum for a deal by the end of the year in the lucrative sector, officials said. But U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned Saturday that some countries in Latin America and Asia need to be more generous with their offers. The United States pulled out of previous attempts to broker free trade in financial services because of its disappointment in offers from other countries. The meeting between the WTO leader and the APEC trade ministers confirmed APEC's role as a regional catalyst for action within the WTO, trade officials said. But Hong Kong expressed its concern about the WTO's dumping code, while Korea and Japan said they were worried about an onslaught of agriculture products flooding their markets from lesser developed countries because of WTO regulations, officials said.

"David Wellings, chief executive of confectionery and soft drinks company Cadbury-Schweppes, said the group was trading in line with plans, and still aims to be one of the top three in confectionery by the end of the decade. ""I think the word we used is robust, that means the business is performing to plan. The base business is performing well and our acquisitions are also growing to plan, especially Dr Pepper,"" Wellings said.   ""I think that is the pattern ahead, a base business growing well and a thrust into emerging markets at a pace which management believes is reasonable,"" he added. Cadbury-Schweppes posted a three percent increase in trading profit to 105 million stg from its confectionery business in the half year to June 15. Trading profits from its drinks business rose to 198 million from 165 million. ""We have a very clear objective in our confectionery stream and that is to be one of the top three by the year 2000. That means we need to sell one million tonnes of chocolate a year by the year 2000,"" Wellings said.   The profits increase was driven by the first full six-month contribution from Dr Pepper/7Up -- the third largest soft drinks group in the U.S. -- acquired in January 1995 for $1.71 billion. ""The acquisitions we made in 1995 are continuing to perform to expectations and that includes our Canadian acquisitions as well as Dr Pepper. Cadbury acquired Allan Candy for an undisclosed amount and Neilson Group for 108 million last year, making it the market leader in Canadian confectionery.   The company is the third largest soft drinks group in the world but trails in fourth spot behind Nestle, Mars and Suchard in confectionery. ""Obviously there are areas of the world where we can expand more quickly than others like Eastern Europe,"" he said. Cadbury's factories in Russia and China came on stream in the first half and Poland reached breakeven point in its second year of confectionery production. In the half year to June 15 Cadbury-Schweppes posted a 12 percent rise in pretax profits to 231 million on sales of 2.29 billion up from 2.03 billion.   ""In North America both confectionery and soft drinks will continue to grow and that is about lifestyle and the breakdown of formal eating occassions and increased opportunities to snack,"" Wellings said. ""So we will continue to see single digit growth even in the mature markets like the U.S. and the UK, but across Europe growth is going to be steady. The French for instance still tend to eat two large meals a day and resist the trend towards snacking,"" Wellings said.   7Up volumes were nearly two percent ahead of last year after a relaunch of its design and advertising but still behind Coca-Cola-owned Sprite, as competitors stepped up their discounting and promotions. When it was first acquired 7Up was level pegging with Sprite and Cadbury is trying hard to turn the brand around. The Dr Pepper brand, however, is outpacing growth in the U.S. market. The company agreed to sell its 51-percent stake in Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages for 622.5 million which will greatly reduce debt and provide more scope for acquisitions, although Wellings declined to be drawn on what they might be. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437 ","TimFarrand"
"Anti-Japanese sentiment is surfacing in Hong Kong, fuelled by a row over a group of South China Sea islands and a wave of nationalist feeling in China. Activists and World War Two survivors with bitter memories of atrocities committed by Japan have staged a spate of anti-Japanese protests over the past month in the British colony, set to revert to Chinese sovereignty next July 1. The latest protest on Friday highlighted how anger against Japan is uniting Chinese in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan -- pulling together even groups whose political differences usually keep them at loggerheads with each other. For the first time, China's mission in Hong Kong opened its doors to its arch-foes the Democratic Party, who handed over a petition calling for Beijing to take action against Japan. The democrats arrived at the door soon after a pro-Beijing group. Anti-Japanese editorials appeared in nearly all Hong Kong newspapers on Friday attacking Japan's claim to the Diaoyu Islands, which are also claimed by Beijing and Taipei. Anti-Japanese demonstrations have become practically a daily occurrence, and local activists are trying to organise a ship to take them to the islands next month to demolish a lighthouse and war memorial erected by Japanese rightists. The English-language Hong Kong Standard lauded the activists' ""courage, determination and optimism."" ""Their cause is a just one. These islands have been Chinese territory since 1534,"" it said. On Thursday, demonstrators handed over a protest note at the Japanese consulate, but Consul-General Hideaki Ueda said they were making a mountain out of a molehill. ""I sincerely hope that the concerned people do not make this issue an artificially big issue,"" Ueda said. He said Japan's navy would take the ""necessary measures"" to halt anybody trying to land on the islands, which Japan calls the Senkakus. The Chinese-language Ming Pao, recalling Japan's past imperialism, said China's history was a stark reminder that tolerating invasion only encouraged worse aggression. ""If Japan did not change its attitude on the islands, it would become the biggest threat to the security of Asia in the 21st Century,"" the paper said. A Taiwan group said on Thursday that they would sail a private fishing boat to the islands, while 31 Chinese journalists in Beijing demanded Tokyo tear down the lighthouse. But the Hong Kong Economic Journal, published in Chinese, said Hong Kong people showed more patriotic fervour on the issue than the communist government in Beijing, which it said offered only rhetorical condemnation. ""It is clear China has no intention of taking any action against Japan to reassert its sovereignty over the islands, as this might jeopardise vital Japanese investment,"" it said. Other newspapers recently published exhortations to China to send in its navy to assert sovereignty over the islands. Over the past few months, several articles also appeared in Hong Kong media recalling Japan's World War Two occupation of Hong Kong and war atrocities committed by Japanese imperial forces against the Chinese population on the mainland. The prospect of British-ruled Hong Kong returning to China next year and Portuguese-run Macau two years later is a point of patriotic pride on the mainland. Hong Kong people talk of this with pride, too, despite some anxiety about becoming subjects of communist Beijing. ","PeterHumphrey"
"Lower U.S. retail prices and tighter profit margins have raised the performance bar for cereal brands, with those that fail to capture adequate market share quickly losing a spot on the grocery shelf. ""The cereal aisle is one of the most competitive aisles in the grocery store. As a result, to remain on the shelves, products have to meet increasingly high expectations,"" said Joseph Rutledge, a spokesman for General Mills Inc, the second largest U.S. cereal marker.   While cutting slow-selling products is a long-standing marketing practice, analysts and industry sources said the process has intensified. ""There is such intense scrunity on the grocery shelf -- what's moving and how fast is it selling -- that you are going to see a tremendous culling out of all these cereals,"" said Anne Tynion, president of North River Strategies Inc, a consumer and corporate brand consulting firm. In 1995, General Mills axed Hidden Treasures and Sprinkle Spangles and launched Frosted Cheerios, its most successful new cereal. Rutledge said the events were unrelated.   The weeding-out of stock-keeping units, or SKUs, is being done by both by cereal manufacturers and retailers, analysts said. In cereal, each variety and box-size is a separate SKU. ""There is evidence that companies are rationalizing their slower-moving, lower-market share SKUs,"" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said. For cereal makers, the need to phase out slow-selling products has intensified with the recent cuts in retail prices, which have pressured profit margins. To make up for lost profits, cereal companies must focus attention on the best-sellers in the grocery store, analysts added.   Pat Browne-Riso, a spokeswoman for number-three Post Cereal, a unit of Philip Morris Cos Inc, said elimination of poor sellers is a natural process driven by consumer demand. ""For example, if a certain size product is preferred over another, or as new products are introduced, we would (do) our best to optimize our space on the shelf as best as possible,"" Browne-Riso said. For retailers, recent cutbacks in promotional spending by cereal makers -- such as offering discounts on wholesale purchases that may not be passed on entirely to consumers -- is prompting grocers to take a closer look at what is selling.   ""It comes back to the efforts of the manufacturers to roll back the promotional spending, which will provide the impetus for the retailers to exercise category management practices,"" SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said. Scanner data, collected at the grocery check-out counter, has provided key information on cereal brand sales. ""It (scanning) has totally changed the grocery environment,"" Tynion of North River Strategies said.

"Tobacco to insurance group B.A.T Industries Plc on Wednesday posted a five percent rise in 1996 profits and signalled it would look at settling anti-tobacco lawsuits in the United States. It also said it would take a closer look at its own corporate structure. The company said it was keeping an open mind about whether to demerge its tobacco and insurance arms but added it was interested in buying a British life insurer. Profits before tax rose to 2.495 billion pounds ($4 billion) but were hit by a 160 million charge for U.S. environmental claims against its Eagle Star insurance unit. Excluding the charge, profit rose by seven percent, putting them at the lower end of stock market forecasts. Chief executive Martin Broughton told reporters that while the company maintained its stance that it had no liability, it now considered it sensible to look at settling U.S. tobacco claims in the context of agreement with Congress. ""The on-going cost in legal terms, and the impact on the share price is such that we think it sensible and appropriate to evaluate a settlement,"" he said. He put the legal costs at $100 million in 1996, which he expected to rise at least for the next two years. A sensible settlement would be one that covered all current and future claims and was approved by Congress and the White House, he said. So far B.A.T has not been approached by plaintiffs or the U.S. government with any sensible proposals, said Broughton. ""There ought to be a sensible figure which gets it sorted out,"" he said. He called plaintiffs' suggestions of $10 billion and $6 billion, which represents the profits of the entire U.S. tobacco industry, unacceptable. He said the company remained confident it would ultimately win any cases against it. B.A.T estimates it has spent 250 million pounds ($402.9 million) in legal costs fighting tobacco-related law suits. About 500 cases have been filed since 1954, but only 19 have so far reached the courts across the industry. As well as disappointment over the exceptional insurance charge some analysts had hoped B.A.T would say more about the possible demerger of its tobacco and insurance arms. B.A.T shares, up 32 percent since November on promising perceptions about its legal battles in the U.S., tumbled 20 pence to close at 530 pence on Wednesday. Chairman Lord Cairns told reporters the company kept an open mind on its corporate structure. ""We are not wedded to the structure that we have at the moment. It is a question over which we keep an open mind."" B.A.T's tobacco business turned in a seven percent overall improvement in local currency to 1.634 billion pounds with group volumes four percent ahead and world market share increasing to 12.8 percent from 12.4 percent.

"China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping died late on Wednesday of complications from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection, the Communist Party announced. The official announcement listed Deng's age as 93. He was born on August 22, 1904, but China adds a year to a person's age after the lunar new year, which fell earlier this month. Announcement of Deng's death came in a letter to the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army and the people of various ethnic groups throughout China and issued by the official Xinhua news agency. Deng, the man whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, died at 21.08 (1308 GMT) in Beijing, Xinhua said. The party and government ""proclaim with profound grief to the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country that our beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping... passed away"", Xinhua said. Deng was in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease with complications of lung infections and died of respiratory failure after he did not respond to emergency treatment, Xinhua said. Chinese sources close to the party said doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy on Deng before he died. The streets were quiet and calm after China's announcement came in the middle of the night, but additional police were seen around the Zhongnanhai government compound in central Beijing and some major intersections. Two armed police carrying assault rifles stood guard at the end of the lane in central Beijing where Deng had lived and questioned reporters who tried to stop in the area. Visitors in small groups were going in and out of the compound where Deng lived, on a leafy alley behind the Forbidden City that once housed China's emperors. Analysts said they expected a relatively stable transition of power since Deng's anointed successor Jiang Zemin has already amassed the positions of Communist Party chief, state President and head of the armed forces. The official Xinhua news agency began to issue a lengthy obiturary filled with praise for the man who ruled China from 1978 until he retired from his last official post in 1990, but whose influence remained supreme until his death. ""Comrade Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader enjoying high prestige acknowledged by the Party, the army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout China,"" Xinhua said. It called him ""a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat, and a long-tested communist fighter, the chief architect of China's socialist reforms, opening up and modernisation drive, and the founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics"". The long stream of titles that did not omit any of the adjectives that China's Communist Party associates with a senior leader in a eulogy, was an official mark that the party planned to ensure Deng was buried with full party honours, analysts said. Deng had not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival, when he appeared frail and faltering in a visit to Shanghai. Chinese sources told Reuters earlier this week that Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng both cut short out-of-town trips last weekend to return to Beijing to visit the ailing patriarch.

"British Biotech Plc moved to reassure its shareholders on Thursday after the surprise resignation of finance director James Noble. ""It is a smoooth transition and we believe we have a broad and strong management team,"" chief executive Keith McCullagh said in a telephone interview with Reuters. ""We have had a number of talks with our major shareholders and they are very confident about what's happening, as are our two brokers,"" he added.   News of Noble's resignation, as the company prepares to launch its first products, came as a complete surprise to analysts who watch the company closely. However McCullagh said Noble ""has been considering his future for some time but his decision has only happened this week."" He denied suggestions of tension at the top of the company, saying ""it is an amicable departure."" McCullagh praised Noble's contribution to developing the business, which has gone from being a small research operation to stand on the brink of entering the FT-SE 100, saying he had ""raised in excess of 300 million stg for the further development of the business and taken the major responsibility for developing relations with shareholders."" Noble has not yet taken another post, but McCullagh said he was considering a number of opportunities. Some analysts believe Noble, who is 37, may want to use his skills in the kind of start-up operation which British Biotech was a few years ago rather than in the large international business it will become if its major drugs, notably cancer treatment Marimastat, succeed. ""His interests and skills are in corporate finance and investor relations and the management of that phase of growth. That is what he likes to do,"" McCullagh said. He added that Noble's replacement would be ""a more traditional finance director than we have had in the past."" The company would be using headhunters to find someone with ""strong international operating experience for a major company which has a range of subsidiaries and which is building revenues and profits."" The chief executive said the decision on Thursday to name chief accountant and company secretary Anthony Weir as finance director of the group's UK operating subsidiary, British Pharmaceuticals Ltd, was to ""emphasise that our financial management is continuing smoothly and soundly."" He also took the opportunity to deny a suggestion in the Daily Mail newspaper that British Biotech, which raised 143 million stg in a rights issue last year, could return to the markets for further funding. ""We have just under 200 million stg in cash reserves and that is a considerable amount of money,"" said McCullagh, adding that it had sufficient funds to commercialise its lead products. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","JonathanBirt"
"NatWest Bank  admitted on Thursday that its multi-million pound derivatives losses totalled nearly twice the amount initially thought and revealed the problem had begun as long ago as December 1994. As a result of initial findings of a wide-ranging internal probe into the loss, the bank also took drastic action to restore confidence by suspending four senior members of staff and cutting millions of pounds from bonuses. NatWest said the total loss was 90 million pounds ($144 million) but that five million had already been provisioned and eight million had been clawed back by not paying the bonuses, making a loss of 77 million pounds in the accounts. It also said Martin Owen, chief executive of the NatWest Markets investment banking division, would forego 200,000 pounds of his 500,000 pounds 1996 bonus. ""It is extremely regrettable that the losses and the mis-pricing have gone undetected for so long. Although confined to one area this is a significant setback for NatWest Markets,"" Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, said. The bank said the losses had started in late 1994 and were confined to its interest rate options area. It said it had suspended four more members of staff, appointed an acting head of global debt derivatives and would not pay bonuses totalling 8.0 million pounds to certain members of staff. The bank said the initial findings of an inquiry into the losses, which were first revealed nearly two weeks ago, had found no flaws in the models used to calculate valuations of the derivatives in question. Neil Dodgson, global head of options, has already been suspended and options trader Kyriacos Papouis left the firm in December. It said the further suspensions were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets. Peter Hall, President and Chief Operating Officer of NatWest Markets, will temporarily take on the additional responsibilities of Chief Administrative Officer. Vincent Tomasi currently Senior Vice President and Head of US Debt Capital Markets at NatWest Markets in New York will take over as acting Head of Global Debt Derivatives. Owen said he was disappointed by the ""serious deficiency revealed in the interest rate options area."" NatWest said the second stage of the review being undertaken by lawyers Linklaters &amp; Paines and accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand will involve the further investigation of the areas where the losses happened. It said it would also mount an investigation of the management issues associated with the deficiencies in these areas. The bank said that a new management structure it had intended to put into place following its 1996 acquisition of U.S. bond trading house Greenwich Capital and the creation of a Global Debt Markets division would now be accelerated. Britain's markets watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority will investigate the actions of individuals in the affair while bank regulator the Bank of England is likely to have something to say on the wider implications of the losses.

"BAA Plc, the British airports group behind Europe's biggest hub at London Heathrow, reported a 6.2 percent rise in nine month pretax profits on Monday as the group remained on a steady course of profitability for the year. Pretax profits for the period ended December 31 were 397 million pounds ($636.5 million), with total revenue up to 1.06 billion pounds versus 987 million pounds. In the nine months 76.6 million passengers travelled through BAA's airports which also include Gatwick and Stansted in London. Sir John Egan, chief executive, said the figures represented ""strong performance across the board"". Airport and traffic charge revenue stood at 385 million pounds, up 5.5 percent. Retailing revenue was 475 million, up 10 percent resulting in net retail income of 331 million, up 11 percent and property income rose 8.4 percent to 168 million pounds. The solid looking set of figures failed to spark the market. Shares were down seven pence at 525 pence per share. ""It was a steady result but nothing terribly exciting,"" one senior dealer said. ""The overall market is a bit weak this morning and the shares are just reflecting that weakness."" Commenting on the outlook, Egan welcomed the greater certainty which followed the Civil Aviation Authority's publication of its regulatory review for the coming five years. That review said there was no need for BAA to divest any of its aiports in the UK and recommended a price control of RPI (retail price index) minus three percent. The price control applies to its airport service charges, but around half of BAA'c sales now come from the shopping malls installed inside its airports. BAA is also moving overseas, submitting bids to run overseas airports. In a separate development, BAA group finance director Russell Walls said it had decided to cut back its stake in a bid group to run three Australian airports. ""We are cutting our stake in agreement with our other partners. The bid had too high a foreign content,"" he said. But Walls denied there was any prompt from the Australian government to reduce its dominance in the consortium, which includes Australian fund managers.

"Dean Foods Inc, which staged a turnaround in the fiscal third quarter with earnings more than double a year ago, expects to make an acquisition in the fourth quarter, potentially in the fluid milk business. ""We are probably talking to more companies today than ever (before),"" William McManaman, chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. Potential acquisition targets include fluid milk processors and or a small company that would complement Dean Foods' specialty segment, which makes coffee creamer, he said.   McManaman said he expected Dean Foods to close at least one acquisition ""in the not too distant future,"" and likely in the current fiscal fourth quarter. Acquisitions in the past have been a growth engine for Franklin Park, Ill.-based Dean Foods. Earlier, it posted better than expected third quarter earnings of $0.51 a share, up from $0.17 a year ago. Earnings reflected improvements in all of its segments, including dairy, vegetables, pickles and specialty foods. Prudential Securities analyst John McMillin called the third quarter results a ""positive surprise.""   ""It's a company that's getting its act together,"" McMillin said. Last year, Dean Foods undertook a strategic review of all its operations, which included closing or disposing of several plants, streamlining vegetable operations, and cutting costs. ""We've pulled back in a number of areas and ridded ourselves of a lot of poor performing pieces,"" McManaman said. ""Now we have to grow our cores a lot faster than in the past."" For example, Dean Foods' pickle operations earned $7.8 million in the quarter, up from $4.9 million a year ago, although sales declined to $82.6 million from $88.0 million.   ""We eliminated a couple of...products where we were not making a lot of money and customers where we were not making a lot of money,"" McManaman said, actions that cut pickle sales but boosted earnings. Vegetable sales in the quarter dropped to $143.4 million from $146.5 million, reflecting lower inventories and higher prices that trimmed some sales. But the division posted a profit of $8.5 million, benefiting from lower costs, compared with a year-ago loss of $547,000. On the dairy side, earnings were $27.0 million, up from $13.5 million last year, while sales gained to $443.1 million from $409.2 million. ""Our volume in the fluid milk business was up over four percent in the quarter, and we didn't make any acquisitions,"" McManaman said. ""That's increased volume or market share in the markets in which we compete."" Dean Foods shares were up 5/8 at 33-7/8 after trading as high as 34-3/8 earlier in the day.

"Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said on Monday it expects most of its grounded Airbus Industrie A330-300 aircraft to be back up and running within three weeks. The British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), meanwhile, urged PT Garuda Indonesia to ground its A330-300 fleet, the Civil Aviation Department (DCA) of Hong Kong said. Cathay's fleet of 11 Airbuses was grounded on Saturday, the day after a Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engine failed on a Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair) flight and forced the plane to make an emergency landing on one engine in the Philippines. It was the fifth time since November that a Cathay Pacific or Dragonair A330-300 had made a single-engine landing. Rolls-Royce said on Friday that gearbox bearings were to blame for the problems with the Trent 700s, which were introduced in March 1995. Dragonair, owned 25.5 percent by Cathay, has also suspended operations of its fleet of four A330-300 aircraft. Roland Fairfield, engineering director for Cathay Pacific, told reporters that Rolls-Royce had proposed a modification to the Trent 700 engine gearbox, which the companies hoped to start incorporating into the Airbus fleet within one week. ""We expect the aircraft to commence re-entering service on a progressive basis in approximately one week's time,"" he said. ""The rate at which the remainder of the fleet enters service is going to be very much a function of how fast manufacturers can supply modification kits and we can get them embodied into the gearboxes, but I would expect at this stage that from the commencement of re-entry of the aircraft into service, the entire fleet will be back flying within two weeks of that date."" Hong Kong's DCA said in a statement that the British CAA call for Garuda to ground its A330-300 fleet had prompted the DCA to tell Garuda that its services to Hong Kong ""should only be operated by aircraft other than"" Trent-powered A330s. But Garuda said earlier it would only ground the airplane if there were an order from the aircraft maker or from the engine maker. Stressing their primary commitment to safety, Cathay and Dragonair declined to give any indication of costs of the suspension, or its impact on 1997 profits. ""Clearly at the appropriate time in the appropriate way we will be discussing these issues,"" said Tony Tyler, director of corporate development. ""It is too early to make such comments we are all aware there are regulations covering what we can and cannot say ...stock market regulations ... and at this stage we are not in a position to comment on that particular feature of this issue."" But analysts expected some erosion of 1997 profits, which some had forecast at HK$4 billion before the suspension. One analyst said the impact would depend largely on how long the fleet remained dormant. Another analyst, Mark Simpson at Schroder Securities, said he was reducing his earnings forecasts for Cathay, but added that Rolls-Royce would almost certainly help defray Cathay's costs and reduce the bottom line impact. Cathay declined to reveal whether any compensation agreement with Rolls-Royce was under discussion. ""We're not in the habit of disclosing the financial arrangements that go on with our suppliers,"" Tyler said. ","SarahDavison"
"Losses have mounted in a stock market slump that has dragged on for years, yet Japanese securities brokers still cling on. But expected liberalisation of brokerage fees could be the final blow for some of the weaker securities houses. Analysts and industry sources say small Japanese brokers are seriously considering closing down amid fears of a plunge in revenues from commission fees, and foreign brokerages are taking a more positive look at the advantages of acquiring local brokers. ""The number of Japanese brokers will likely fall to half the current level over the next five to 10 years,"" an official at a Japanese securities house said. ""Many small brokerages are likely to close down or be liquidated."" As seen in Europe and North America, some analysts say revenues from commission fees will fall by at least 30 percent within one or two years of deregulation, while others say they could fall by half within the initial year. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced a five-year ""Big Bang"" plan last November to enable Japan to catch up with reforms carried out a decade ago in Europe and North America. Japan will finalise procedures next month to implement the reforms, which include the timing of liberalising commissions and breaking down barriers between financial sectors. They may also include abolishing a system under which brokers must operate under licences granted by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), analysts say. No Japanese brokers have voluntarily closed and handed back their licences to the finance ministry since the licence system began in 1968. But such moves are now in sight. Industry sources say a small broker based in Osaka, Ogawa Securities Co. Ltd., an affiliate of Yamaichi Securities, could be the first to go into voluntary liquidation, as Yamaichi may not give it financial aid. Ogawa said recently it had no plans at present to stop doing business. Yamaichi, meanwhile, says it is considering how it will deal with Ogawa's difficulties. There are about 285 brokerages in Japan, including 56 foreign firms, but only 25 brokers, all Japanese, are listed. A senior finance ministry official told Reuters the ministry would accept voluntary liquidation by brokers. He added that brokerage fees should be liberalised in the final stages of the ""Big Bang"" process after other areas of the securities business have been deregulated. ""We are well aware that local brokers would face difficulties unless they are given a certain period of time to prepare for the liberalisation of brokering fees,"" he said. Indeed, the financial strength of domestic brokers has deteriorated since the bursting of the late 1980s ""bubble"" of inflated asset prices. Last month, the Big Four -- Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi -- and one of Japan's 10 second-tier brokerages, Kokusai Securities, announced earnings for the year ended March 31. But the other nine second-tier brokers all said they expected losses for the year due to stock price falls. They will announce their earnings figures this week. Among the nine, Dai-Ichi Securities and Yamatane Securities said they would be reporting losses for the seventh consecutive year. Analysts say many of the second-tier brokers, which depend on stock commission fees for 50 percent to 60 percent of their revenues, are likely to eventually be acquired by big banks. Medium-sized brokers face more urgent restructuring moves this year, such as mergers and seeking outside capital, because by law they must raise minimum capital reserves by the end of next March, they said. Meanwhile, one analyst said foreign brokerages and non-financial Japanese firms had begun seriously studying the possibility of taking over local brokers. ""Foreign securities houses are keen to strengthen underwriting and asset management businesses and they want to have more networks to do so,"" the analyst said. ","FumikoFujisaki"
"Cisco Systems Inc. is set to announce the acquisition of Telesend Inc., a developer of low-cost, high-speed Internet access technology, sources familiar with the deal said Tuesday. Cisco agreed to acquire Telesend, a privately-held Cupertino, Calif.-based firm, in exchange for an unspecified amount of stock in Cisco, the sources said. Additional financial terms were not available. Telesend is the developer of a new telecommunications technology known as ISDN DSL, or IDSL for short. The full name is Integrated Services Digital Network Digital Subscriber Line. A Cisco spokesman had no comment on the acquisition other than to say, ""Most of our acquisitions are of small, privately-held firms."" The spokesman, Adam Stein, said Cisco has made 14 mainly technology-oriented acquisitions in the last three-and-a-half years. Officials of Telesend were not available to comment, but an automated voicemail system answering calls at Telesend's offices in Cupertino transferred callers directly to a Cisco switchboard operator. Cisco is headquartered in nearby San Jose. Telesend's IDSL is a local-loop modem technology that allows phone companies to offer Internet access connections from central office switches to local customers at speeds of up to 128,000 bits per second, or about four times the speed of standard phone lines. Kieran Taylor, an analyst at market research firm TeleChoice Inc., said buying Telesend is a strategic move by Cisco to counter IDSL products announced a month and a half ago by rival equipment maker Ascend Communications Inc.

"Canada's top securities regulator and its biggest stock exchange said on Friday they are working on tougher rules for Canada's mining sector -- tarnished at home and abroad by the Busang gold saga. The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and Toronto Stock Exchange have been under fire since news that Busang may not be the century's richest gold find, rocked the mining world. In a joint statement, the OSC and TSE said a special task force would examine setting new standards for how companies conducted exploration programs and how the results were reported. ""We haven't concluded that (new standards are needed), but we feel it's appropriate at this stage to look at the situation,"" said OSC Chairman Jack Geller. The TSE is also considering tightening procedures for listing new companies. Questions have been raised about the due diligence the exchange performed on Bre-X Minerals Ltd. before including it in the key TSE 300 and TSE 100 indices. Critics say the controversy swirling around Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X, the discoverer of Busang, has given Canada a black eye. Bre-X has been under pressure since preliminary tests by its partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. on the Busang gold property indicated the deposit may contain ""insignificant"" amounts of gold. The announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion), or more than 80 percent, off the company's stock market value. Bre-X has commissioned an independent audit of the Busang project and stood by its estimate of 70.95 million ounces of gold. While investors anxiously await the test results expected in early May, attention has turned to the personal stock trades of top Bre-X officials. The OSC, which is probing Bre-X for possible violation of insider trading and disclosure laws, said on Friday that no Bre-X insiders reported trades last month when the stock collapsed. The Alberta Securities Commission on Friday also reported no activity by Bre-X officials in March. As the OSC/TSE task force gets down to work with a report due in autumn, some foreign miners are already trying to distance themselves from Canada's tarred image. In a statement issued shortly after the Bre-X selloff, U.S.-based Nevada Pacific Mining Co. Inc. said it ""wishes to advise that it has no association with any Canadian based brokerage house, investment bank, or mining analyst, no Canadian based shareholders on its share register, nor is it planning to list on any Canadian stock exchange."" Australian mining officials said earlier this week the Bre-X situation may not have happened if Canada had adopted mining reporting standards similar to Australia's. Canada was the only country ""dragging its feet"" in efforts to have it and the United States, Australia, South Africa and Britain adopt a uniform reporting code, Norman Miskelly, head of an Australian industry reporting standards committee, told Reuters on Tuesday. The OSC's Geller said he doubted Australian standards would have prevented a situation like Bre-X, but acknowledged they needed improvement. ""They are somewhat out of date and they are being brought up to date,"" he said. Geller rejected criticism that fragmentation among Canada's provinces has made it difficult to get an agreement between the country's five stock exchanges and several securities commissions. Canada has tried for several years to set up one national securities commission. Meanwhile, the negative impact on Canada's reputation as an international mining finance center will be short, some analysts predicted on Friday. ""Certainly there will be a sting, but Canadian institutions and markets were doing well before Bre-X and they will do well after Bre-X,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada in Toronto. ""That Australia is pointing the finger is more boosterism than anything else."" Meanwhile, federal officials said there is no pressure for a federal inquiry into the Busang/Bre-X affair. Canada's last major mining inquiry was a Royal Commission probe in the 1960s in which a mining promoter was jailed briefly for stock manipulation linked to worthless samples from a Northern Ontario drill site. ""There is absolutely no indication in any way that the federal government has started any investigation,"" said Dale Hull, a department of natural resources official. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"An overture by China to bring its critics into the team picking Hong Kong's future leadership shows openness but might split the democratic camp in the British colony, analysts said on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this month the 400-member body that will choose the chief executive and legislators who will run the territory after its July 1, 1997, transfer to China could include people with divergent views on democracy. His remark at a Beijing meeting was taken in the colony as an olive branch towards Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party, which so far has been excluded from transition arrangements. Although pegged to the acceptance of China's plan for an appointed ""provisional legislature"" to replace the current fully elected council, the remark was in stark contrast to China's harsh invective against the party over the past year. The gesture is also fuelling heated discussion in local political circles and newspaper columns about China's motives. ""It might be an attempt to split the democrats, but more probably Beijing has realised that they've failed to split them so far and it's time to get them on board,"" Hong Kong University political analyst Nihal Jayawickrama told Reuters. ""I'm sure there are elements in the Democratic Party who will feel the urge to respond positively,"" he said. But Democratic Party leader Martin Lee last weekend rejected the idea of joining the Selection Committee, saying that would amount to recognition of an illegitimate body. The party argues that China's plan to scrap the present legislature and appoint a new ""provisional"" one has no basis in law or in the handover treaties with London. ""So long as China insists that any participant must assist in both selection processes -- Hong Kong's future chief executive and the provisional legislature -- I can't see how they can get the democrats on board,"" Jayawickrama said. But he said it was likely the temptation would prove strong for some of Lee's associates and that they would quit the party. China is very eager to give the Selection Committee a greater air of legitimacy by including some democrats, some China analysts in Hong Kong believe. ""At the end of the day, it's a question of who gets into the committee. And I don't think people like Lee or (deputy party leader) Szeto Wah would get in even if they are nominated,"" political commentator Andy Ho told Reuters. The leaders of the party, the biggest in this territory of 6.2 million people, have drawn Beijing's wrath since 1989 when they sided with the student-led, pro-democracy movement that Chinese army tanks crushed in Tiananmen Square. ""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that China has changed its position towards the Democratic Party,"" Ho said. ""It just wants to create an impression of openness."" Some of China's Hong Kong advisers differ in their view of Qian's remarks. Tsang Yok-Sing, a pro-Beijing politician, has said he did not see them as an invitation to the democrats. Emily Lau, an outspoken independent democrat who has often riled China's communist rulers, interpreted Qian's comment as a brazen effort to drive a wedge into the democratic movement. Qian had divided the pro-democracy camp into ""people who are prepared to compromise their principles and those who will stand firm"", Lau wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post. ""With the scramble for seats on the Selection Committee having begun in earnest, it will rapidly become clear that some members of the pro-democracy camp are eager for a place... These people have long been itching to open dialogue with Beijing and are now only too eager to be given recognition,"" Lau wrote. ","PeterHumphrey"
"Apple Computer Inc. Friday said it plans to cut 4,100 jobs in a restructuring aimed at returning the company to profitability. The troubled computer maker said the restructuring, its second major overhaul in the last 12 months, will result in a $155 million charge in its second quarter ending in March. The reserve would be in addition to a planned $325 million charge the current quarter for the previously announced purchase of Next Software Inc. The cuts -- including 2,700 full-time employees and 1,400 contract workers -- were slightly less than what some analysts had expected. Apple said it planned to begin notifying employees about the layoffs later this month. Apple, once the darling of the computer industry, has suffered in recent years from missed opportunities, management turmoil and failed strategies that resulted in the firings of former Chief Executives John Sculley in 1993 and Michael Spindler in 1996. Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who took over about a year ago, said the latest restructuring was aimed at boosting Apple's core business. ""The top priorities guiding our reorganization are the rapid delivery of distinctive products for our loyal business, education, and home customers, and the development of a robust next-generation operating system to carry them into the future,"" Amelio said in a statement. ""We can best achieve these goals by streamlining our organization, simplifying our product lines to deliver fewer but much stronger models, and stopping investments in activities that are not central to these core businesses,"" he said. Over the last five quarters, Apple has posted more than $900 million in losses, reflecting slower sales of its flagship line of Macintosh personal computers and restructuring expenses. In a statement issued after the market closed, Apple said it will phase out its slow-selling Performa Macintosh home computers this spring in favor of Power Mac models. Disappointing Christmas sales of the Performa line led to a stunning $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and a steep decline in Apple's market share. According to research firm Dataquest, Apple's share of the worldwide PC market tumbled to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent in 1995. As part of the restructuring, Apple said it was exploring options for its Netwon hand-held personal assistant and will no longer produce Apple-branded Pippin devices, which enable television sets to access the Internet. While Apple will continue to enhance its Mac Operating System, the company said some parts of the system -- such as the Open Doc component software technology, Cyberdog, Open Transport, Game Sprockets, and Mac OS Development Tools -- will receive less money for upgrades. Apple will also halt funding for the Video Conferencing Solution and AIX Server Software. The moves are aimed at cutting Apple's expenses by at least $400 million a year so the company can be profitable with revenues of around $8 billion. Apple said it was revising the delivery schedule for future Mac Operating System releases but still plans to deliver its latest version, code-named Rhapsody, in 1998. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"The Czech Republic's trade deficit nearly doubled in January, year-on-year, as exports stagnated, and analysts said they saw little change in the trend of the burgeoning trade shortfall. The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said the January trade deficit hit 13.6 billion crowns compared with a 7.86 billion crown deficit in January 1996. The CSU added that imports, led by continued strong inflows of machinery and raw materials, grew by 8.2 percent year-on-year, while exports contracted by 2.5 percent, spurred by a sharp 11.8 percent decrease in raw material exports. ""The figures are better than expected...the market expected above 15 billion crowns...but I don't think it will mean any change in the trade (balance's) development,"" said Petr Tomek of Zivnostenska Banka. The bureau did not issue a revised end-year 1996 figure for the trade balance, which hit a record 160.3 billion crowns. It has forecast the 1997 trade deficit to rise to about 215 billion crowns. The CSU said overall nominal imports for January firmed to 60.04 billion crowns from 55.5 billion for the same month last year, while exports totalled 46.45 billion, down from a previous 47.63 billion. Boris Gomez of ING Barings said that while January's trade figures were an improvement from December, where the monthly figure was 17.996 billion crowns, the beginning of the year is traditionally a period of slowing trade. ""We're not overly encouraged since historically the first two months of the year we usually see relatively lower deficits because of generally weaker trade flows,"" he said. ""We are hoping for a stabilisation of the deficit. If what happened last year when the deficit picked up pace in the second quarter, it's not good, though we are banking on import growth slowing a bit given the tight monetary environment."" Last summer the central bank tightened its monetary policy, raising its discount rate one full percentage point to 10.5 percent, and minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months in the Republic hover around 12.5 percent. Analysts added that the trade figures were also influenced by the strengthening of the currency, the crown, which gained some three percentage points against its dollar/mark basket in January, boosted by demand brought about by a wave of over 35 billion crowns worth crown-denominated Eurobonds. ""If the Bundesbank sees it policy down the road of keeping the mark relatively weak to help the economy, that's not good news for the Czechs, nor are the rumblings that the economic recovery of the EU may be slower than expected,"" Gomez said. CSU figures showed EU countries accounted for more than 60 percent of both imports and exports with the Czech Republic. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","AlanCrosby"
"The Justice Department is investigating possible bid rigging during airwaves auctions held by the federal government for wireless phone licenses. Justice Department documents obtained Wednesday by Reuters showed the department's antitrust division also is looking into whether bidders schemed illegally to divvy up the licenses being sold. The Federal Communications Commission has raised more than $20 billion since 1995 by selling licenses to companies offering a new generation of cellular phone service known as ""personal communications services,"" or PCS. A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the investigation. She said the antitrust division was ""looking into the possibility of anticompetitive conduct by bidders in connection with the FCC's auctioning of spectrum for PCS."" She declined to comment on whether the investigation covers all three of the big PCS auctions that have been held. But sources familiar with the matter said the department is seeking information from companies about all of the sales. The department documents focus on the PCS auction that ended in mid-January and raised $2.5 billion. It involved dozens of bidders. At that auction, the FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making it the most licenses sold at once. A third of the licenses were reserved for small-company bidders. Top bidders were units of Sprint Corp., AT&amp;T Corp. and BellSouth Corp. A spokesman for Atlanta-based BellSouth said the company had not been informed by the government of any investigation. A spokesman for New York-based AT&amp;T said the No. 1 long-distance carrier had received a request for information from the Justice Department and intended to coperate fully. A spokeswoman at Westwood, Kan.-based Sprint had no immediate comment. Attorneys familiar with the investigation said the department has sent out ""numerous"" letters requesting information and documents from auction participants. The ""civil investigative demand"" seeks information about companies' bids, their bidding strategies and communications about the auction with other telecommunications firms. In a sign that the investigation is looking into the possibility of bid ""signaling"" among participants, the department requested documents showing the last three digits of company bids. One attorney familiar with the investigation said it was evident during the bidding that companies used the last three digits of their dollar bidding figure to signal their intentions to other auction participants. ""It's clear a certain amount of this was taking place,"" said the attorney, who spoke on condition of not being identified. Attorneys expect antitrust investigators will focus on whether companies used such practices to stay out of each other's markets during bidding, or to influence prices. In particular, investigators are expected to probe whether some of the bidding practices merely represented bluffing, or were indeed antitrust violations, said attorneys. Companies hired academics and game theorists to help advise during the PCS sales. FCC officials declined to comment on the investigation. But sources said the agency had been alerted about the practice of ""signaling."" Attorneys said a company involved in the January PCS auction, High Plains Wireless LP, had asked the FCC to take away Mercury PCS II LLC's licenses. High Plains accused Mercury of improper signalling involving licenses in Texas. Mercury has denied the charge. The Justice Department investigation comes at a rocky time for the FCC's airwaves sales. An auction that ended last week raised a disappointing $13.6 million, with licenses for some wireless communications markets fetching just $1 apiece. The total was way below the $1.8 billion that Congress was banking on to help eliminate the federal deficit. ","RogerFillion"
"Britain's Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings Plc, a likely bid target for rival broadcasters, said on Tuesday it believed any offer would have to be at a hefty premium to its current share price. YTT chairman and chief executive Ward Thomas told a news conference that he believed a bid from northern neighbour Granada Group Plc was ""extremely likely"". Granada has built up a stake of 27 percent in YTT, the ITV commercial television broadcaster to northern cities such as Leeds and Newcastle, and has long been expected to mount a bid. That speculation has pushed YTT shares up by some 80 percent over the past 14 months to their current level of around 12.50 pounds ($20.07), giving the company a value of around 800 million pounds, including warrants. But Thomas suggested any realistic bid would have to be pitched at around 17 pounds per share. ""I say 17 pounds to Gerry (Granada chairman Gerry Robinson),"" Thomas told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""It's a conversational gambit,"" he added. United News &amp; Media Plc, which already operates ITV franchises for southern and eastern England, is another potential predator, with a stake of some 14 percent in YTT. Thomas was speaking after YTT announced a 40 percent rise in 1996 pre-tax profit to 30.2 million pounds. It paid a total dividend for the year of 18 pence per share, against 14 in 1995. YTT shares were down 7-1/2 pence at 12.40 pounds at 1430 GMT. Thomas said that YTT's profitability could be greatly enhanced if it succeeded in its campaign to have its annual licence fee reduced from an annual 66 million pounds and improved its share of ITV advertising income. YTT is urging a return to a special duty on advertising, which was originally introduced in 1961 but later scrapped. Thomas argued that the duty should be applied to all broadcasters including pay television operator BSkyB and the Channel Four commercial station, both currently outside the licence fee system. Thomas called YTT's 1996 share of ITV advertising revenue disappointing after it fell to 10.3 percent of ITV income. It is in talks with Laser, its advertising sales agency, to market the whole of northern England as a single region. The fact that Laser is owned by Granada, the ITV broadcaster in north-west England, could facilitate this move. ($1=.6228 Pound) ","KeithWeir"
"Lucent Technologies Inc. said Thursday it earned $66 million the first three months of 1997, reversing a big loss as it ended its first year as an independent company. Lucent, the former high-technology manufacturing unit of AT&amp;T Corp., reported net income of $66 million, or 10 cents a share, for the three months ended March 31, reversing a loss of $103 million, or 16 cents a share, in the 1996 quarter. The company, which designs and builds public and private communications systems and networks and telecommunications equipment, said revenues for its fiscal second quarter grew by 12.5 percent to $5.15 billion from $4.58 billion. Lucent said it benefited from strengthened relationships with the regional Bell companies that followed its spin-off from AT&amp;T a year ago. Previously, local phone companies had been reluctant to do business with the AT&amp;T equipment unit, seeing AT&amp;T as a potential rival in the coming era of open competition for local and long-distance services. Of Lucent's four main businesses, only consumer products suffered a decline in revenues for the quarter, which was expected, the company said. ""We're delighted to report double-digit revenue growth and a dramatic quarter-over-quarter rise in profits as we complete our first year as a public company,"" Chairman Henry Schacht said in a statement. ""Our strong U.S. and international sales to network operators, businesses and microelectronics customers position us well to take maximum advantage of the exploding communications technology market."" The company, based in Murray Hill, N.J., said its gross profit margin for the quarter rose to 42.1 percent of revenues from 39.9 percent, due primarily to higher sales volume and productivity improvements. Lucent said its revenues from systems for network operators increased 23.3 percent to $2.93 billion. Revenues for microelectronic products increased 18.3 percent to $615 million and revenues for business communications systems increased 14.1 percent to $1.308 billion. Revenues from consumer products decreased 41 percent to $174 million as a result of continuing reengineering of the business to increase profitability, Lucent said. The company said the decrease was expected following the closing of its phone centre stores, the streamlining of its product line and expected reductions in phone rentals. Lucent said continuing demand for second telephone lines in businesses and residences for uses such as Internet access, data traffic and fax services contributed to solid gains in sales of wireless systems, switching systems and related software. Chief Financial Officer Don Peterson said the company expects its lagging consumer products unit -- the smallest of four product divsions -- to show substantial profit gains in 1997 and a return to revenue growth by the December quarter. ""We expect a substantial improvement in profitablity this year (for the unit) mainly through cost-cutting, and positive revenue growth"" due to new products, he said. Lucent's stock closed at $54.125, down 50 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. ","EricAuchard"
"Channel 5, the British terrestrial television channel gearing up for launch next month, is confident of winning a five percent share of UK viewing by the end of the year, chief executive David Elstein said on Tuesday. ""We're confident we can deliver five percent of total viewing by Christmas this year,"" Elstein said as Channel 5 presented its programming schedule. The exisiting ITV commercial network has an audience share of over 35 percent. However, its annual programme budget of 600 million pounds is much bigger than the 110 million core figure earmarked by Channel 5. ""Channel 5's audience will grow as ITV's declines,"" said Dawn Airey, Director of Programmes. She promised ""intelligent, stylish and popular"" shows from a channel that is hoping to be a hit with the young consumers sought after by advertisers. Channel 5 is  owned by a consortium of British firms Pearson and United News &amp; Media plus Luxembourg broadcast group CLT and US investment firm Warburg Pincus. It will go on air on Easter Sunday, March 30, having delayed its launch by three months in order to give it more time to complete the task of retuning the nation's video recorders. It has employed an army of retuners to visit millions of homes across Britain to prevent its signal from interfering with video playback. Elstein said that Channel 5 should be available to around 40 million people -- just over 65 percent of the population -- at launch in March. But he said this should grow to 45-46 million, or around 85 percent of Britons, by the end of the year as an extra broadcasting frequency comes into operation. However, he conceded that as many as two million of the 18 million households covered may need to buy new aerials or aerial extensions to pick up the signal clearly. Major areas of Britain will not see the new commercial channel, the first to be launched in this country since 1982. The Scottish city of Glasgow and parts of Wales and the south-west will miss out but Channel 5 hopes to fill in some of the gaps by securing carriage on cable and satellite systems. Channel 5 plans what it calls a ""stripped and stranded"" schedule. Behind the jargon lies an attempt to make it easier for viewers to know what is on at a particular time. A ""stripped"" show runs on consecutive days, at the same time each day while a ""stranded"" show rotates with other similar shows in the same slot each day. Channel 5 will show a daily soap at 1830, its main evening news will be at 2000 and it will have a film at 2100 every evening. Films lined up include Speed, Independence day and Mrs Doubtfire. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8793 ","KeithWeir"
"Heavily indebted Nippon Credit Bank Ltd said on Thursday it will tie up with New York blue chip Bankers Trust to help turn some of its loans into cash. NCB, with a heavy load of real estate loans left over from the asset bubble of the 1980s, has been considered the most endangered large bank in Japan's faltering banking sector. On April 1 it announced that it was retreating from the international arena. It also said that it was selling prime real estate and floating new shares to try to rebuild its capital base. Under the alliance, Bankers Trust will help NCB ""securitise"" some of its loans, turning them into stocks or bonds that are sold to outside investors. The tie-up with Bankers Trust will also enable NCB to maintain services to its customers after its planned withdrawal from overseas business, the two banks said. NCB said that it would also consider a capital tie-up with Bankers Trust, which is on an expansion drive. ""We will consider limited capital participation in each other after the ongoing restructuring of NCB's capital is completed,"" the statement said. Industry analysts said such an equity deal would be the first time a foreign bank has taken a stake in a Japanese bank. But they said that it was very unlikely that Bankers Trust would take over NCB. ""(The tie-up) will make it easier for NCB to implement its restructuring programme, but its return on equity is too low for the U.S. bank to consider any takeover move,"" said Yoshinobu Yamada, analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. The market took the news well, with an increase in buying interest in NCB debentures. As one of Japan's three long-term credit banks, NCB raises the bulk of its cash through issuing debentures rather than taking deposits from customers. In a blow to NCB's image, the debentures were recently downgraded to junk-bond status by Moody's Investors Service. But Thursday's announcement won praise from regulators and the markets. ""The tie-up will contribute greatly to a smooth implementation of NCB's restructuring plan,"" the Bank of Japan said in a statement. The deal was also cheered by the stock market, with NCB shares surging as much as 30 percent in afternoon trading. There was no trading for most of the day due to a surge of buy orders hitting the market. When NCB announced its restructuring, President Hiroshi Kubota said the bank was very interested in getting help from a foreign partner, a rare statement for a Japanese corporate leader and seen as a sign of the difficult situation facing NCB in its attempt to get back on its feet.

"ITT Corp. met with financial advisers on Thursday to assess an unsolicited $6.5 billion bid from Hilton Hotels Corp., while some Wall Street analysts said the company's best defence might be to pursue an acquisition. Industry experts said ITT might be able to stave off the takeover if it made a large casino or hotel purchase. ""ITT is a company with a lot of friends on Wall Street and a lot of investment bankers and there are a lot of players in the gaming industry who would like to trade up to a higher quality,"" said Thomas Ryan of Bankers Trust. Although ITT is widely expected to reject the offer, sources close to the company said no decision had been made and no acquisition talks were being held. ITT's board will consider the bid at a regularly-scheduled board meeting next Tuesday. ITT declined to comment. On Monday, Hilton offered to buy ITT in a stock and cash transaction that values the company at $55 per share. The offer also includes the assumption of $4 billion in debt. The stock of New York-based ITT, which soared most of the week on views Hilton would be forced to raise the bid, fell 75 cents to $56.875. On Friday, ITT's financial advisers are expected to pore over Hilton's official bid documents that are to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. An acquisition ""certainly would be in keeping with the company's history. (ITT Chairman Rand Araskog) has either got to be a buyer or he's got to let the company go,"" said Gerry Shapiro, managing director at KPMG Peat Marwick. Industry experts said a sizable acquisition by ITT would thwart Hilton's takeover plan by making the purchase price too costly. In a telephone conference call with reporters earlier this week, Hilton Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach vowed the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based company would only pursue transactions that added to earnings. Industry experts speculated that one of the most attractive acquisition candidates would be Harrah's Entertainment Inc. which has long been considered ripe to participate in industry consolidation. A spokesman for Harrah's declined to comment. An acquisition would also further solidify Araskog's role at the company he has run since 1979. He ran the ITT conglomerate and then took over the hotel, entertainment and gambling portion of the company when it split into three pieces in 1995. ""I think Rand Araskog doesn't want to give up his job.,"" said Forum Capital Markets analyst Philip Platek, who also speculated that ITT could buy a gambling or lodging company. ","RobinSidel"
"Britain and China moved ahead on Wednesday to resolve outstanding details of Beijing's recovery of sovereignty over Hong Kong this year. Just a day after they had agreed on a budget to straddle the handover, the two sides announced a breakthrough allowing Hong Kong a free hand to organise media coverage of the historic event on June 30 without China's interference. And Britain's chief diplomatic negotiator said he thought there would soon be an agreement on one of the last burning issues -- the right of abode in the territory. The latest progress comes just four months before Britain ends a century and a half of colonial rule and hands the territory of 6.4 million people back to communist-ruled China. But a possible political bombshell lurked in the background as a prominent pro-democracy legislator prepared to ask the government to press China on the role of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong after the change of flag. On the media accord in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), Britain's negotiator Hugh Davies said: ""We very much look forward to as many as possible of the international press, the local press being interested in participating and recording and reporting on the handover ceremony."" Human rights and democracy activists had voiced fears that China would not consent to a media invasion without the right to vet which journalists come to the event. ""The two sides have agreed to entrust the Hong Kong government to receive and process applications from journalists, as well as handle and arrange other matters relating to media coverage of the handover ceremony,"" the two sides said. ""There will be no criteria applied...provided you don't turn out to be a terrorist,"" Davies told reporters. It was the second positive turn in the JLG talks in as many days. On Tuesday Britain and China struck a deal on Hong Kong's 1997/98 fiscal year, starting April 1 and covering the handover year. Finance Secretary Donald Tsang will read the budget to the legislature on March 12. ""We are convinced it will be welcomed by society,"" said Chinese representative Chen Zuo'er, adding that the budget would stick to Hong Kong's ""prudent and moderate"" tradition. Davies said after that deal that he was hopeful a deal could soon be done on right of abode, covering who would have residence rights in Hong Kong and on what terms. ""I hope major progress can be made on those matters which are not yet resolved,"" his Chinese counterpart Zhao Juhua said. The two sides also still have to work out an agreement on details of the People's Liberation Army garrison that China plans to install in Hong Kong, as well as a guest list for the handover ceremony, and a string of air services agreements. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's post-colonial leader-to-be Tung Chee-hwa saw his fortunes climb in the opinion polls as the latest survey showed more than three quarters of people felt confident he would do a good job as Hong Kong's Chief Executive. But Tung remained under pressure from Hong Kong critics and foreign governments concerned about his support for Beijing's plan to roll back democratic freedoms in the territory. The United States, European parliament members, as well as newsaper editorial writer, have urged Tung and China this week to realise that political and economic freedoms go hand in hand, and that a cut in basic rights could hurt the economy. A group called the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature, on Wednesday condemned the opening of a liaison office for the shadow legislature that China plans to install on July 1, dissolving the present elected Legislative Council. It urged the Hong Kong government to seek a court injunction against the move. ","PeterHumphrey"
"Investors swept up in the current wave of ""red chip"" fever for China-related stocks are at risk of losses because of the poor health of many mainland state-owned companies, a senior economist warned on Friday. Demand for the Hong Kong-listed companies with mainland ties has accompanied record highs in the Hang Seng index, in a burst of optimism about Hong Kong's handover to China in three weeks. But Kenneth Courtis, strategist and chief economist at Deutsche Bank Group Asia Pacific, warned that the speculative gains could be short-lived in light of serious problems with mainland Chinese companies. A growing number of Chinese and China-backed companies have listed in Hong Kong, and the lure of China's huge domestic market and economic potential have proved difficult for foreign investors to resist. In Hong Kong, punters -- from serious investors to the unsophisticated -- have formed long queues to get their hands on subscription forms to buy new shares, sometimes paying for them, in the hope of making fortunes. ""People who are rushing into the streets to try to pay their $100 to get a subscription form may think they'll be able to sell that some time soon,"" said Courtis. ""Things like that usually end in tears and it won't be any different this time,"" he told the Foreign Correspondents Club. But Courtis said caution would be a better bet as many mainland state-owned companies were losing money and Beijing itself was in a race against time to restructure them. Chinese state-owned enterprises, which have lived under the shelter of communist rule, remain deeply inefficient and Beijing is encouraging many of them to merge into huge conglomerates in the hope that the stronger firms may help ailing ones. ""We are now in a situation when losses (made) by state companies are so big that they've come to destabilise the financial system,"" Courtis said. He said that the problems of these companies are a factor in China's difficult campaign to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which promotes free trade and reliance on market forces. ""One of the reasons it is so difficult to negotiate WTO membership for China is that (most) state companies wouldn't survive under WTO rules."" Courtis said he did not think China would enter the WTO for four to five years but was confident the United States will continue Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status for China for another year. ""It will go through this year. The President might have to use his veto to overscome the resistance...but the debate will be bitter,"" he told reporters after his speech to the club. President Bill Clinton announced in May his decision to renew China's MFN status but many members of Congress have said they will vote against it, angered by China's policies on trade, human and religious rights.

"The China-appointed committee handling the handover of Hong Kong voted on Saturday to support Beijing's decision to roll back civil liberties after the British colony returns to Chinese rule this year. Just one of the 150 members of the Preparatory Committee voted against the motion to approve Beijing's plans to rewrite sections of Hong Kong's statute book after it regains control of the colony on July 1. A further 10 committee members abstained from the vote, which was held at the close of a two-day session in Beijing. ""I do not agree with the abolishing of some of the ordinances, which include the Bill of Rights ordinances and the public order ordinance,"" said Frederick Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, who cast the sole dissenting vote. ""They were talking about striking out the laws, which I could not agree to because I could not find anything that is contradictory to the Basic Law,"" said Allen Lee, chairman of the pro-China, pro-business Liberal Party, who abstained. China says its Basic Law, a mini-constitution for Hong Kong, will fully protect the colony's future autonomy and its residents' political and civil rights. Beijing's plans to repeal or amend 25 of Hong Kong's laws and ordinances, including parts of the Bill of Rights as well as regulations on public assembly, have prompted protests from Britain and democracy activists in the colony. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten slammed the plan on Thursday as a repugnant proposal to dilute the territory's civil liberties. China has defended the move, accusing Western media of distorting the nature of the proposed changes and saying that only those provisions that contradict laws dealing with international affairs or national defence will be removed. Hong Kong's post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa, who is attending the crucial committee meeting in Beijing, has supported Beijing, saying the international community has misconstrued the situation. ""I think things are being done in a very orderly, proper manner,"" Tung said on Saturday. ""The Basic Law explicitly provides freedom and our rights."" Following the Preparatory Committee's motion to recommend Beijing's planned legal changes for the colony, the proposals would now go to China's National People's Congress for a final decision, Tung said but gave no timetable. Some of the 25 laws and articles set to be repealed or altered include some that are the product of recent British-led reforms while others are the trappings of the colonial era. ","ScottHillis"
"Port arrivals of 1996/97 Ivorian cocoa totalled around 1.02-03 million tonnes by May 12, down from 1.11 million by that date in the record 1995/96 year, port sources said on Tuesday. Weekly arrivals at Abidjan and Ivory Coast's second port, San Pedro, dropped sharply to 5,000 tonnes in the week to May 12 from about 50,000 during the final week of the main crop (Oct-April), raising concern that the size of the May-September mid-crop would be disappointing. ""The mid-crop has been weak so far but we are still optimistic,"" said one Abidjan-based crop analyst. ""Some people thought it was going to be a bit late but we are optimistic as July and August will be the most important time (for arrivals)."" Ivory Coast's main crop totalled around 1.04 million tonnes by its April 27 close, against about 1.06 million tonnes in 1995/96 when a larger than expected mid-crop of just under 200,000 tonnes took that year's total to a record of around 1.2 million tonnes. Early forecasts of Ivory Coast's 1996/97 crop proved to be cautious as arrivals by the end of the main crop had exceeded Ivory Coast's official full-year (Oct-Sept) forecast of up to 950,000 tonnes. The 1996/97 crop is not expected by local crop analysts to set a new record but it will not be far behind if early private mid-crop forecasts of 150-180,000 tonnes prove to be correct. ""We are still fairly optimistic. Our figure is at the higher end of that range but we may cut by just a little,"" said the crop analyst. Other crop analysts said recent talk of a mid-crop as small as 80,000 tones had been based on weak May and early June arrivals and signs of poor bean quality and sizes. ""What was around was small but I think it (bean quality) has improved,"" said one analyst. ""It should now be possible to get beans of 105 to 110 (beans per 100 grams)."" Ivory Coast's export grade standard of 105 beans per 100 grams sometimes eludes exporters during the mid-crop, when bean sizes usually decline along with harvest volumes. Exporters last year were surprised by high bean quality well into the mid-crop period. Export quality inspectors have reported bean sizes in a 105-110 range with little evidence of humidity problems. Torrential rains since mid-May have not raised bean humidity levels above the eight percent permitted for export grades. Farmers had problems drying main crop beans during heavy December rains, leading to some quality problems at port. Crop analysts also report favourable signs for next year's 1997/98 main cocoa crop, but add that no reliable indication for the first half of that year would appear on trees until late July. ""We are only looking at the very beginning and it looks fairly good,"" said one. ""Nothing untoward has happened and rumours of a disastrous crop are probably wishful thinking.

"Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and French chemical group Rhone-Poulenc SA Thursday announced the merger of their animal health businesses to create a new company that will be the world leader in the sector. Merial Animal Health, their 50/50 joint venture with estimated 1996 sales of $1.750 billion, will be the market leader in biology products, veterinary drugs and poultry drugs, they said. Merial will overtake Pfizer-Smithkline Beecham, Bayer and Novartis -- the recent merger between Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG of Switzerland. Igor Landau, managing director of Rhone-Poulenc, told a news conference in Paris that the merger would cut costs and have an effect on jobs, although it was too early to give details. ""It will not be in France that the impact will be most pronounced,"" he said, adding that the merger would have a positive effect on Rhone's results. Merck will make an unspecified payment to Rhone for the 50/50 parity. ""Taking everything into account, the valuation of our business was higher than that of Merck,"" Landou said. The joint-venture will merge the animal health activities of Rhone Merieux and Merck AgVet. It will be headed in the first few years by Merck's John Preston, while Rhone's Louis Champel will become chief executive of Merial and will succeed Preston. Merck was No. 2 in animal health in 1995 but has been overtaken in 1996 by Novartis. Its leading product, Ivermectine, loses some of its patent protection next year but still has about eight years of sales ahead of it. Sales for this product alone in 1996 have been $750 million. Rhone Merieux's main product is the recently launched Frontline, which has had sales this year of $85 million and are expected to double in 1997. Merial will benefit from the launch of a number of new Merck products in the coming years while a new jointly developed product will be ready in three years. ""The real creation of added value is in innovation,"" Landau said, stressing the possible synergies of the joint research and development. The Merial venture is the latest of a series of big corporate moves in animal health. In 1994, American Cyanamid was bought by American Home Products Corp. In 1995 Pfizer bought the animal health business of Smithkline Beecham Plc and Rhone Merieux acquired the veterinary business of Sanofi, part of Elf Aquitaine. In 1996 Belgium's Solvay sold its animal health business to AHP. Landau said that Mallinckrodt, No. 9 in world animal health, was for sale but that Rhone was not interested. Asked to comment on rumours of a merger between Rhone's Rhone-Poulenc Rorerand Sanofi, following a statement Thursday by Elf that a merger was desirable for Sanofi, Landau said Rhone was not interested in a pharmaceutical alliance.

"Australian flag carrier Qantas Airways Ltd on Thursday reported a 2.4 percent rise in net profit for the 1996/97 first half, but warned its Japan routes were unlikely to repeat the profitabiliy of the early 1990s. Qantas, 25 percent owned by British Airways Plc, reported a net profit of A$151.6 million for the six months ended December 31, a result towards the higher end of market expectations which ranged from A$116 million to A$154 million. For the year to June 30, the airline said it aimed to at least match the A$246.2 million net profit recorded in 1995/96.   Qantas said revenues were not expected to grow quickly, fuel prices were forecast to remain high and price competition was expected to continue in most markets. Future capacity expansion would be limited by the rate of productivity gains. ""The outlook is therefore for relatively modest fleet expansion and an undiminished drive for efficiency improvements and cost reductions to increase profits."" Qantas chairman Gary Pemberton told reporters the growth in first half profit was largely attributable to the airline's cost cutting programme which is aimed to offset the anticipated slowdown in the rate of revenue growth.   Pemberton said cost savings of A$237 million had been made in the half year, and full year cost savings were expected to exceed the airline's target of A$430 million. Sales rose 2.5 percent to A$3.97 billion for the half, with A$2.03 billion coming from its domestic operations. Overall passenger revenue was flat, with revenue falling in its North American, Japanese, and other Asian markets. Revenue from Japan fell about 30 percent to A$315 million in the first half. Qantas did not expect the contribution from the Japanese market to improve in the second half. ""It won't improve significantly,"" finance director Gary Toomey told reporters.   ""Major changes in the Japanese market resulted in virtually no net contribution. This is a sharp contrast to the situation three years ago when the Japan route accounted for the bulk of Qantas international profits,"" Pemberton said in a statement. Qantas' international routes recorded earnings before interest and tax of A$168.3 million in the first half, compared with A$163.3 million a year earlier, while domestic earnings fell to A$88.2 million from A$93.0 million.   ""There is fundamental change occuring in distribution in the travel industry in Japan. It is becoming less structured, there is more competitive pricing,"" managing director James Strong said. ""The economic situation is not very buoyant in Japan, the currency has been very strong, so it is a combination of all of those factors,"" Strong said. Pemberton told Reuters after the news conference that the fall in contribution from Japan would not be made up from tourism growth to Australia from other Asian markets.   ""No it won't compensate. They are different markets, there is a different yield structure and customer profile."" He said other Asian markets, which included South Korea and Taiwan, were very competitive and historically operated on lower yields than the Japanese market had done in the recent past. Pemberton said the first half result was also hit by higher fuel prices. Qantas had absorbed increases of over A$50 million, net of hedging gains. At constant fuel prices, operating profit before tax would be up over 21 percent on a year earlier.   ""Looking beyond 1996/97, the airline will continue to expand, but at a slower rate than the very high levels of the last three years,"" Pemberton said. Passenger numbers had grown more than 32 percent and capacity by more than 27 percent since December 1993. Investors welcomed the result pushing Qantas shares up four cents to A$2.46 at 0400 GMT, while the broader market fell. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","KevinMorrison"
"APEC ministers agreed on Friday on further trade and investment liberalisation in the telecommunications sector, but recognised they cannot drag China into the forum's agenda of trade liberalisation. ""There has been an agreement by all economies to adopt the strategy of going towards open trade and liberalisation in the trade in telecommunications,"" Australian telecommunications minister Richard Alston told reporters.   The Australian minister said China was connecting 15 million telephone lines a year, but still had one of the lowest penetration rates of fixed telephone lines amongst members of the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. ""The challenges and the enormity of scale of operations of that country can hardly be compared to countries such as PNG (Papua New Guinea) and Brunei ... and so that is why you would have to allow for different views,"" he said at the end of the three-day meeting.   Alston said he was also hopeful that Malaysia, which was the only member of the APEC group not to come to the meeting, to attend future meetings. Malaysia did not attend the initial APEC telecommunications ministers meeting in Seoul in 1995. ""We would all hope Malaysia will over time see the benefits that derive from collective discussions,"" Alston said. ""I think the high level of interest amongst the 17 economies, that will benefit Malaysia, even in absence.""   Alston, who hosted the second APEC ministerial meeting on telecommunications and the information industry, said APEC could not push member countries to conform to a uniform policy. ""It is not a regional government. It is not intended to drag unwilling players along a path that the majority thinks desirable,"" said Alston in reply to a question about reports that China was reluctant to adopt telecom liberalisation. ""Whilst there might be some domestic reservations about particular aspects, the overall guiding principles are well recognised. You simply don't find a member economy that does not espouse the principles of the reforms in this area,"" he said.   Although there were no tangible projects to come out of the meeting, ministers agreed on further collaboration on working groups to look at telecommunications for rural development, distance education, information sharing and the environment. ""It would be very short sighted if we simply committed ourselves to physical rollout without taking into account the effect to the natural environment,"" Alston said. Alston said rapid technological change in informational technology and telecommunications had thrown up new challenges, such as dealing with the acceptance of electronic commerce and taxation issues that go along with it.   ""Undoubtably there will a reluctance to fully embrace electronic commerce and all of its manifestations, until we do solve problems of privacy,"" Alston said. Alston said he expected electronic commerce to be a growing industry once encryption and security issues had been resolved, but taxation issues will start become more important. ""It hasn't yet reached the stage of being an avalanche of siphoning off the revenue from the taxation authorities, but it clearly has some potential in that regard and I think all member economies are aware of the need to handle the issue,"" he said.   The next meeting of telecom ministers is in Singapore in mid-1998.

"The success of Australia's film industry, basking in the international spotlight after a spate of worldwide hits, has spurred Hollywood talent scouts to search down under for the next ""Shine"" or ""Babe"". This has been evident at Sydney's ""Tropfest"" short film festival, which attracted representatives from Hollywood agency William Morris and the Cannes film festival for the first time. The festival has drawn big-name judges, too. This year's included George Miller, the producer of box-office hit ""Babe"", while actress Nicole Kidman and ""Portrait of a Lady"" director Jane Campion were judges last year. Oscar-nominated Geoffrey Rush was to attend but went to Los Angeles to collect his Screen Actors' Guild Award for best actor in ""Shine"", said John Polson, Tropfest's founder and director. Now seen as the nation's premier short-film festival and a talent pool of film-makers, the first Tropfest four years ago saw just 50 film buffs squashed into a Sydney cafe one night to watch their home-made films on a television set. ""Although it started as a bit of a joke, it is seen by many people as a legitimate thing to win,"" Polson said. ""I know many people out there in the commercial (advertising) field, who are just desperate to win Tropfest and get some sort of acclaim from their peers,"" Polson told Reuters. ""Previous winners each year they have gone on to big and better things,"" said Polson, who is also an actor. Gregor Jordan won the 1995 Tropfest with his film ""Swinger"" and went on to win the Cannes Film Festival jury prize for best short film. Last year's Tropfest winner, Jonathon Ogilvie, was a Cannes finalist with his work ""This Film is a Dog"". NEARLY 200 ENTRIES TV stuntman Nat Edgerton won this year's Tropfest with ""Deadline"" over nearly 200 other films, almost double the number entered in 1996. The first Tropfest drew just eight entries. Because of the increase in films, Polson decided to show them in February and March at cafes on Sydney's cappuccino strip -- Victoria Street -- near the King Cross red light district. The month-long festival, which ends on March 23, has become big business. This year's festival cost about A$180,000 (US$141,000) -- the first Tropfest cost Polson about A$800. Tropfest takes its name from the Tropicana Cafe in Victoria Street, seen as a popular hangout for aspiring film-makers. The cafe still has a strong link with the festival, donating a year's supply of coffee to a winner of its own choice. ""I saw it (Tropicana) in those days as the place where people were most guilty of sitting around and talking about movies and not actually out there making them,"" Polson said. ""The festival is about encouraging people to make films, it is not just about screening them. We could be a festival where we just get the best short films from around the world."" The only criterion for a Tropfest entry is that the film must be seven minutes long and have a pickle in it. Last year it was a teaspoon and the year before that it was a coffee bean. Tropicana was the sole host of the first two festivals. In its third year the festival crowd took up the whole of Victoria Street, and this year, 13,000 people filled Victoria Street and the local park, where the films were simulcast by satellite. POPULAR BLEND Mixing films and coffee has proved a popular blend in Sydney and Polson plans to take this combination to cafes around Australia with the help of satellite technology. ""What I want to do next year is have a link-up with other cafes in capital cities around Australia so that we have a national film festival happening simultaneously,"" Polson said. The boom in local short-film festivals is attributed both to Australians'love of film viewing and the international success of Australian films. ""I think people are realising that it is just as satisfying, if not more so, to...watch 10 or 12 succinct, strong and well executed ideas as it is to go and watch a feature,"" Polson said. In recent years, Sydney has hosted the Flickerfest and Metfest festivals, and Melbourne the St Kilda festival. Ansett Airlines has started begun showing short films on its flights and TV's Seven Network Ltd is about to begin a 30-minute programme of shorts. Both are partly owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who also has 50 percent of Australian pay television network Foxtel, which has the right to show the Tropfest films. ","KevinMorrison"
"Leisure group Rank Group Plc said on Thursday it planned to create 3,000 full-time jobs in Britain this year as it completes a radical restructuring. Rank, which operates the Hard Rock Cafes around the world, said the outlook for its businesses was promising after a year in which an exceptional charge of 232 million pounds ($375 million) badly hit profit. Profit before tax in 1996 fell to 65 million pounds from 515 million the year before. However, the 1995 figure was boosted by a 236 million pound exceptional gain. Rank raised its net dividend by eight percent to 17 pence per share and said operating profit before exceptional items was 13 percent higher at 290 million pounds. In early trading on Thursday, Rank shares, which have underperformed the market by some 20 percent over the past year, added 12p to 427p. Chief executive Andrew Teare, who took the job last April, said that Rank was well placed after a financial restructuring and a decision to focus on four divisions -- Hard Rock, Holidays, Leisure and Film and Entertainment Services. ""These changes, together with the benefits of our investment programme and the generally favourable economic climate, provide a promising outlook for Rank,"" Teare said. He said that Rank planned to sell its film distribution unit, which has a catalogue of classic British films dating back to the 1950s as well as some more modern American movies. The unit also has a British distribution operation, run as a joint venture with Castle Rock-Turner of the United States, and an international sales arm. Newspapers have speculated that the sale might raise up to 150 million pounds but Teare indicated he thought some of the figures in the press were on the high side. Rank said it would be creating the 3,000 jobs by opening new bingo clubs, pubs, night clubs, holiday centres, cinemas and a leisure centre at sites around Britain. Operating profit at three of Rank's four core divisions showed double-figure growth. The exception was holidays, where profit fell one percent as margins came under pressure at the Resorts USA campground and timeshare business in the United States. The exceptional charges related mainly to a 148 million pound property value writedown, plus a loss on disposals and charge for restructuring. Comparisons with last year were further complicated by a change in the way Rank accounts for its remaining 20 percent interest in Rank Xerox, its office equipment joint venture with America's Xerox Corp. Rank repeated that it planned to sell the stake when a suitable opportunity arises. ($1=.6184 Pound) ","KeithWeir"
"The Australian government will release the Wallis Inquiry's report into Australia's financial system on Wednesday at midday (0200 GMT) and is expected to respond to some parts of the report. The five-person inquiry, set up in June last year and chaired by businessman Stan Wallis, took 268 submissions from the financial sector's main players about various options for reform.   These players' views on various reforem options were detailed in the inquiry's 415 discussion paper released in late November. Their positions and views on the various options follow. SCRAPPING THE 'SIX PILLARS' MERGER POLICY IN FAVOUR - National Australia Bank Ltd, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, St George Bank Ltd and Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said bank mergers should be judged in the same way as other sectors -- by the ACCC on competition grounds alone. They said big bank mergers would not necessarily harm competition because of new technology and global competition. Such mergers would create efficiencies, lower costs and could create Australian banks big enough to compete overseas. AGAINST - Finance Sector Union (FSU), National Farmers Federation (NFF) and Australian Consumer Association (ACA) said big bank mergers would concentrate too much 'economic power' in too few hands. EQUIVOCAL - The Federal Treasury said it was also concerned about the concentration of economic power, but did not explicitly favour the retention of ""Six Pillars"". The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said one merger of the big four into three would not create prudential risk problems, but a cut to two banks would. ALLOWING BIG BANK TAKEOVERS BY FOREIGNERS IN FAVOUR - The Treasury, ACCC, St George Bank and Citibank argued foreign investment in and takeovers of big banks should be allowed because it created extra competition. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said globalisation and liberalisation of trade meant the removal of such restrictions was inevitable. AGAINST - ANZ said foreign takeovers may see head offices shifted and create brain drain, citing the New Zealand example. Life office Colonial Ltd and Westpac noted community concern over need for Australian ownership and control of key assets. SCRAPPING RULES LIMITING EQUITY STAKES IN BANKS TO 15 PCT IN FAVOUR - Treasury, ACCC, life office National Mutual said restrictions on industrials and other corporates owning 10 percent of a bank (or 15 percent with government approval) should be removed to open banks up to normal competitive pressures of having strong shareholders and allow better access to capital markets. AGAINST - Life office and insurer MLC Life questioned logic of allowing anyone to buy a big stake in a bank, saying it may lead to investors pulling out in times of crisis, weakening safety of banking system. CREATION OF A MEGA-REGULATOR, REMOVAL OF RBA'S PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISORY ROLE IN FAVOUR - AMP, National Mutual, Colonial Mutual, NAB and the Treasury said mega-regulator would be more efficient, help break down barriers to competition and remove moral hazard problem for government of government-owned RBA being responsible for stopping banks from falling over. They also said prudential regulation and monetary policy conduct by RBA may create conflict of interest. AGAINST - Most banks, the RBA and ISC said the RBA should keep prudential powers over banks as RBA was the only entity able to inject liquidity to save banks in crisis and had market knowledge and skills to monitor bank's prudential safety levels. CLARIFICATION OF NON GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEE IN FAVOUR - RBA, Treasury, Westpac, National Mutual said the current situation where deposits are not government guaranteed should be clarified so depositors know RBA will try to ensure deposits are repaid, but cannot guarantee deposits. The current implied government guarantee also favoured banks over other competitors, they said. DEPOSIT INSURANCE SCHEME AGAINST - Most submissions opposed deposit insurance, saying it increased moral hazard problem and penalised bank deposits in favour of mutual funds, who do not have deposit insurance. OPENING UP ACCESS TO THE BANK PAYMENTS, SETTLEMENTS SYSTEM IN FAVOUR - NAB, Treasury, National Mutual, Aussie Home Loans and various Credit Unions said access should be opened up to non-banks and life groups to increase competition, so long as deposit-taking institutions meet minimum capital requirements and were overseen by RBA as banks are now. AGAINST - RBA, CBA, ANZ, Westpac, St George Bank and Colonial said the payments system was so crucial to overall health of economy, it should only be open to banks. -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730 ","BernardHickey"
"China is setting up a national state debt trading market to link up all state debt trading floors around the nation to check widespread irregularities, industry analysts said on Monday. The computerised market, the China State Debt Clearing System, would gradually take over the trading of all state debt in the country with the current markets, including the Shanghai stock exchange, taking a minor role, they said. ""Nearly all China's state debt trading is now regional,"" said a trader with China Guotai Securities. ""An institution trading in Shanghai cannot have its positions cleared in Shenzhen, which is inconvenient. ""With the new market being opened, a trader can bid and ask on any market around the country through the computer network,"" he said. Major players on China's state debt markets currently include state banks, securities houses, state enterprises and wealthy individuals looking for quick returns or for short-term cash for speculative investment elsewhere. The bulk of China's state debt is traded through the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges, but there are dozens of other centres through which state debt can be traded. ""The primary purpose of the market is to check rampant irregularities,"" said one state debt investment analyst. ""The most important aim is to eradicate credit trading."" China's securities rules ban the trading of state debt on credit but in practice many trading centres have accepted 20 percent margin requirements for state debt repurchase trading, traders said. The state debt margin trading has led to huge losses for some state banks and other financial institutions, due to unrecoverable debts, traders say. The official media reported in mid-1996 that the Wuhan Securities Exchange Centre, the Tianjin Securities Exchange Centre and the STAQ system, which trades China's institutional shares, had accumulated debts on the repo market of up to 50 billion yuan ($6.02 billion). Traders said some banks and brokerages had already started to put their state debt under the auspices of the new market but that formal trading on the system, based in Beijing, was not expected to start until the second half of this year. ""Once the national market begins full operations, financial institutions will be required to have all their state debt entrusted to it,"" said one trader. ""This will effectively end credit trading."" Another reason for setting up the centrally-controlled computerised market was to enforce a recent ban on state banks trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets, analysts said. The central bank at a recent meeting told state banks to phase out trading on the markets, not to build new positions and to offset existing positison only gradually, to ensure that bank money would not flow into the volatile stock markets. ""All we big four state commercial banks have to get out of the markets,"" said one banker with the Bank of China. ""The new market will enable the central government to enforce the ban."" The big four are the Construction Bank, the Agricultural Bank, the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Industry sources said the People's Bank of China, the central bank, was preparing to play a major role on the new market to trade short-term treasury bills of one year and below with the state banks in its open market operations.

"Under pressure from angry stockholders to restructure, WMX Technologies Inc. said Wednesday it agreed to sell for $626 million the 19 percent stake it holds in ServiceMaster L.P., a provider of services ranging from lawn chemicals to household maids. Oak Brook, Ill.-based WMX, the nation's largest garbage hauler, is in the midst of a broad restructuring intended to appease dissatisfied stockholders and refocus its business. On Feb. 4, it unveiled plans to divest $1.5 billion in assets, cut 3,000 jobs and buy back 50 million shares of stock. WMX Chief Executive Officer Phillip Rooney resigned Tuesday, just a week after his ouster was demanded by an investment group controlled by financier George Soros. WMX owns or has rights to acquire 29.035 million restricted shares of ServiceMaster, including an option to purchase 1.875 million shares that would be cancelled as part of the transaction, the companies said. ""Although our investment in ServiceMaster has provided exceptional returns to our shareholders, WMX is returning to a highly focused waste management services company and we believe our investments should be limited to core business activities,"" said WMX Chairman and acting Chief Executive Dean Buntrock. ""With this transaction, we are well along the way toward achieving our goal announced two weeks ago of monetizing an additional $1.5 billion of non-core assets."" The stock sale is expected to be completed on or before April 14, the companies said. Following the news, WMX's stock was off 37.5 cents at $34.375, while ServiceMaster rose 12.5 cents at $25.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. ""The transaction is expected to be immediately additive to ServiceMaster earnings per share and will provide significant, incremental tax benefits to ServiceMaster,"" said ServiceMaster Chief Executive Carlos Cantu. ""It also eliminates market uncertainties regarding the status of the WMX shares,"" he said. Cantu said ServiceMaster intends initially to finance the stock repurchase with bank financing. ServiceMaster's network of service companies includes ServiceMaster Consumer Services and ServiceMaster Management Services, and ServiceMaster Diversified Health Services and International. Its Consumer Services unit owns and franchises TruGreen-ChemLawn, Terminix, ServiceMaster Residential and Commercial Services, Merry Maids, American Home Shield, AmeriSpec and Furniture Medic. Analysts said the sale of the ServiceMaster stake and Rooney's resignation may signal that WMX intends to speed up its restructuring and meet its critics head-on at the upcoming May 9 annual shareholders meeting, where some expect a heated battle for control of the company.

"Canada's Barrick Gold Corp. appeared to regain the upper hand on Tuesday in the perplexing fight for control of the massive Busang gold find in Indonesia. Barrick said on Tuesday that a letter from the Indonesian government supported a proposed joint venture between Barrick and Bre-X Minerals Ltd., the Calgary, Alberta-based company that discovered Busang. But the letter made plain that the government's blessing was conditional on satisfying the demands of Bre-X's Indonesian partners -- PT Askatindo Karya Mineral and PT Amsya Lyna -- within a month, Barrick said. ""The main thing here is that the government has reaffirmed its support of Barrick's participation,"" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg told Reuters. ""This is a very significant step forward."" The Indonesian government told Barrick and Bre-X last November to agree on a joint venture to develop Busang. The companies submitted a proposal to the government in December, asking for clarification on a few issues. However, delays in completing the agreement prompted Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc. to make a $5 billion counter-proposal for Bre-X last week. Under Placer's rival bid, 40 percent of Busang would go to Indonesian interests. The letter from the Indonesian government received this week by Barrick and Bre-X addressed only their joint venture proposal and mentioned nothing about the Placer Dome offer. Barrick gave little weight to Placer Dome's rival proposal after receiving the letter. ""I don't see how the Placer proposal can at all affect the progress we'll be making in reaching a final agreement,"" Borg said. Placer was undaunted. ""We don't see it like that,"" Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver. ""We have a creative and compelling proposal on the table and we expect it will succeed."" Meanwhile, Barrick said the Indonesian government had offered to help Bre-X sort out its relationships with its Indonesian partners and analysts believe Askatindo is the key to forging a successful deal between Barrick and Bre-X. Askatindo, which has a 10 percent stake in the richest parts of Busang, is controlled by the Syakareni family and Muhammad ""Bob"" Hasan, a close associate of Indonesian President Suharto. Hasan bought a 50 percent stake in Askatindo earlier this month. ""The Indonesian people are looking for a bigger participation,"" observed one Toronto-based gold mining analyst. Others said Bre-X, Barrick and the Indonesian government were being pressured to work out a way to give Askatindo a larger share of Busang. In its letter, the government stipulated that Barrick and its partners should get 67.5 percent of a new company that would develop Busang. Bre-X and its partners would keep 22.5 percent and the Indonesian government would get 10 percent. It was unclear whether Askatindo's portion was included in Bre-X's 22.5 percent. ""That's what we have to work out with Bre-X and Askatindo,"" Borg said. Bre-X officials did not return telephone calls asking for comment. ","HeatherScoffield"
"Marathon labor contract talks dragged Saturday at a key auto supplier, with some progress being reported in a bid to avoid a strike that would quickly halt light truck production at General Motors Corp. Bargainers for American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Inc and the United Auto Workers (UAW) had been talking for 35 hours straight as of 5 p.m. Saturday, seeking to hammer out terms for a new three-year contract that would cover 7,200 hourly workers. A midnight Friday strike deadline set by the UAW expired without any picket action. Union members remained on the job Saturday, as the company proceeded with its normal weekend operations of limited production and maintenance work. ""There is progress,"" said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be named. ""The attitudes are good."" A strike at American Axle's five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y., would shut down light truck production at GM's 11 North American truck plants within days, and create more supplier hardships for Ford Motor Co. American Axle, which was spun off from GM in 1994, supplies rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars, as well as various parts for other passenger car lines. The company makes axle shafts that are used by Ford in its F-150 pickup trucks, Expedition and Explorer sport/utilities and some rear-drive passenger cars, although inventories of those supplies are not as critical as the GM parts. It also makes axles for a small number of Chrysler Corp. light truck products. Tight inventories among axle suppliers means GM's light truck plants would run out of parts by early next week, analysts said. The world's largest automaker could lose after-tax profits of $20 million a day if it were forced to suspend light truck production, analysts said. American Axle and the UAW are at odds over wages and other economic issues as the union seeks to impose on the company the same pattern contract the Big Three automakers agreed to for about 400,000 UAW members last fall. Automakers guaranteed jobs for 95 percent of their current workforce in a contract that provides $2,000 lump sum payments in the first year and wage hikes of three percent in the second and third years. The pact allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $19. American Axle, however, wants to start new hires at a lower rate and extend the time it takes to reach the full rate to six years, union officials said. The Big Three pact has a ""grow- in"" rate of three years. But if the company were forced to match the Big Three pattern it would be at a severe cost disadvantage against its competitors, a company spokesman has said. The American Axle talks have drawn attention because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract. Meantime, a UAW strike against Johnson Controls Inc, a key seat supplier for Ford, entered its 19th day Saturday with no settlement. ","ToddNissen"
"Global One, a telecommunications venture owned by Sprint Corp., Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom, lost more money than expected in 1996 and is poised to cut jobs, two sources close to the company said Wednesday. The venture set up in January last year was expected to lose $250 million for 1996 but has in fact lost almost $370 million, one source close to the venture told Reuters. ""The partners are furious about the losses. Word has come down that they are looking to cut jobs,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. Neither Global One nor Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint, which owns a 33 percent stake in the group, would comment. It was not immediately possible to contact Deutsche Telekom or France Telecom which share the remaining 67 percent. However, a second source, close to one of the partners later confirmed the accuracy of the story. Current analyst expectations are of losses of up to $250 million, of which around $85 million would be attributable to Sprint and $51 million of that has already been recorded in the first nine months. Sprint is planning to report fourth quarter results on Feb. 4 and First Call's analyst consensus of fourth quarter earnings has already slipped in recent days to 69 cents per share from 70 cents, compared to a year ago 79 cents, when Sprint posted a net profit of $278 million, excluding one-time charges. Analysts say much depends on the proportion of the loss attributable to Sprint, the tax effects, and how the partners account for it, but it will clearly hit earnings per share. ""If this is true, Global One's effect on Sprint will jump up from per share losses of 2-4 cents per quarter in the first nine months to in excess of 10 cents in the fourth quarter,"" said Bill Deatherage of Bear Stearns. Global One currently has 2,900 employees and has been spending heavily to build a network powerful enough for it to carry traffic for other telecom firms as well as to cater to the global needs of large businesses. The partners have revealed no financial details about Global One's performance in 1996 except to say it is expected to end the year with more than $800 million of orders. ","NickLouth"
"Port arrivals of 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) Ivorian coffee totalled about 150,000 tonnes by March 16 compared to about 110,000 tonnes in 1995/96 despite doubts over quality, exporters said. ""It is a larger crop than last year,"" said one industry buyer. ""The figures tie in with forecasts of upwards of 230,000 tonnes but as with last year marketing has been left a little later because of a large cocoa crop."" Ivory Coast produced around 180,000 tonnes of mainly robusta coffee in 1995/96 and has slated 230,000 tonnes for 1996/97. A mild January-March flowering period in early 1996 and a peak in the strong-moderate-weak production cycle had helped boost the 1996/97 harvest, crop analysts said. Exporters said 120,000 tonnes had been taken to Abidjan and 30,000 to Ivory Coast's second port, San Pedro, since the season opened in mid-November. Port sources put coffee exports to mid-March at little over 40,000 tonnes as sorting and grading had slowed port throughput, leaving warehouse stocks of around 100,000 tonnes. ""Trade is still talking about 230,000 tonnes to 300,000 tonnes but even 230,000 tonnes is big for Ivory Coast,"" said one. ""Exports are still low so stocks have built up."" Large volumes of cocoa had reduced available warehouse space from December until a wave of shipments against March contracts, exporters said in February. Coffee marketing usually picks up from Janaury as cocoa arrivals fall. One port source said quality problems meant that not more than 150,000 tonnes would be exported in 1996/97, but others disagreed. ""There is now a lot of buying of all grades but the coffee is taking a long time to prepare for export,"" he added. Yields per hectare had risen this year -- with one plantation manager citing 600 kilos per hectare compared to 400 last year -- but grading was taking much longer. Exporters who fund upcountry purchases to meet export contracts (Oct-Sept year) said careless harvesting and poor sorting continued to be a problem. Markets were now being found for lower grades after a world price rally followed a slump in late 1996, exporters said. ""Everything will find a way out so nothing will be wasted. Some will be sent out to eastern Europe or other such markets,"" said one. ""There are possiblities for black beans (sub-grade) but you never know what arrangement people have been able to make."" Crop analysts recently touring upcountry farms said village farmers' wives were still busy winnowing large volumes of coffee initially rejected by upcountry buyers. Farm union officials said coffee had had been badly stored after rains hampered drying in December. Some cooperatives were still short of sacks for sending coffee to ports, one said. -- Matthew Bunce, Abidjan Newsroom +225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"Moves to secure the release of about 60 Colombian soldiers held by leftist guerrillas could be hampered by failure to agree on the international character of a team to mediate the handover, a Red Cross spokesman said on Monday. ""Perhaps the most complicated element (of creating a mediation commission) is whether to view it as a national or an international issue,"" a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said. ""The important thing for us is that these people are released as quickly as possible and in good health."" Just one day before the deadline set by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for creation of the commission, the guerrillas have still not nominated their own delegates to oversee the release of the prisoners, captured during a raid in southern Putumayo province on Aug. 30. In a telephone interview on Monday, Marco Leon Calarca, part of the FARC's general secretariat based in Mexico, said they would propose Guatemalan Nobel prize winner Rigoberta Menchu. But it was uncertain how far the government would allow the FARC to use the release of the prisoners as a chance to publicise its guerrilla war to an international audience. Some analysts believe the FARC wants to use the release to show it is a genuine guerrilla army, not terrorists and drug traffickers as charged by Colombia's government and military. But the government is keen to treat its fight against left-wing guerrillas as a largely domestic affair and it has insisted there is nothing to negotiate when it comes to the prisoners' release. ""We want to set up a commission that carries real weight so that the government is forced to create the right conditions for the handover,"" Leon Calarca said. ""We want both an international and national presence."" Once the commission is formed it will negotiate the timetable for the soldiers' release and witness the handover. The troops were seized in an attack on a jungle camp in Las Delicias in which 27 soldiers were killed. It marked the start of one of the bloodiest guerrilla offensives in decades. The government has nominated three people to the panel, Bishop of Bogota Monsignor Pedro Rubiano, former Foreign Minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo and ex-Sen. Alvaro Leyva. ","KarlPenhaul"
"China warned the Vatican on Tuesday not to meddle in its religious affairs, specifying that missionary work and appointments of bishops were the prerogative of Beijing. ""China acts in line with its own national circumstances in administering its religious affairs,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing. Chinese authorities keep a tight grip on religious activities amid nervousness in the ruling Communist Party that unauthorised religious gatherings could lead to local instabilty that would threaten its rule. Asked to comment on a meeting scheduled for Tuesday between the Pope and Taiwan Vice-President Lien Chan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen told the Holy See not to interfere. Beijing is bound to be further angered by the meeting, and wants the Vatican to sever ties with Taiwan, which China has regarded as a rebel province since their civil war ended in 1949. Lien will be the highest-ranking Taiwanese official to visit the Vatican. China also appeared irked by a statement by Pope John Paul on Monday that the Vatican would closely watch how Catholics in Hong Kong were treated after the British colony is handed over to Beijing in July. ""We would hope to have no interference in our religious affairs, and when we talk about interference, the scope is very wide, not only including missionary work but also in appointments of bishops,"" Shen said. ""These should all be independently determined by China and there should be no interference by the Vatican,"" he said. In his annual ""state of the world"" address to diplomats accredited to the Vatican, the 76-year-old Pope said on Monday the Holy See would be monitoring events in Hong Kong after the July 1 handover from Britain to Beijing. The Pope was ""trusting that respect for differences, for the fundamental rights of the human person and for the rule of law will accompany this new journey forward"". Last year the Pope appointed Shanghai-born Monsignor Joseph Zen, 64, as coadjudicator bishop of Hong Kong, which means he will eventually succceed Cardinal Joseph Wu as Catholic leader. By appointing a bishop with right of succession before the handover, the Pope sought to guarantee continuity for the church in Hong Kong and effectively bypassed consultations with Beijing that would probably become necessary after July 1. Beijing does not allow Catholics to recognise the Pope's authority. Chinese Catholics who want to worship openly must belong to the state-controlled Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. Those loyal to the Pope worship secretly. China's Catholic and Protestant churches, both tightly controlled by the state, claim several million believers but many more are believed to worship at underground churches. ","JaneMacartney"
"Investigators fought frigid, wind-blown snow on Friday trying to recover the remains of 28 adults and one infant killed when a commuter plane crashed into a field and left a blackened crater. John Hammerschmidt, senior member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters the cockpit voice and flight recorders had not been recovered but that he was sure they would eventually be found. The devices usually provide investigators with detailed information on the final seconds before a crash. Hampering the search for both human and aircraft remains were temperatures falling to near zero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius) and ground blizzards that created near white-out conditions. Workers were able to stay in the wooded field for no more than 15 to 20 minutes at a time, he said. ""There is a crater out there"" hiding some of the wreckage, he said, including propellers, engines and engine assemblies from the 30-seat, Brazilan-built Embraer 120 operated by Delta Comair. In addition, eight-foot (2.5 metre) high brush covered with snow from the storm during which the plane crashed on Thursday made recovery efforts difficult, Hammerschmidt said. ""There are remains just all around the entire scene,"" he said. Local police had removed some of the remains to a morgue and families of some of the victims were taken to a nearby motel, where teams of counsellors were on hand. Hammerschmidt said the 28 adults and one ""babe in arms"" aboard the twin-engine propjet lifted off from Cincinnati at 2:53 p.m. EST, and the plane crashed and 3:52 p.m. during its approach to Detroit's Metropolitan Airport. He said the pilot, Dann Carlsen, 43, of Williamstown, Kentucky, was very experienced and was a flight instructor. He also said the plane was equipped with de-icing systems for the wings, the leading edge of the propellers and for the engines. Hammerschmidt refused to speculate on whether ice was a factor in the crash. USA Today said a pilot in the vicinity reported icing conditions at about the same altitude the doomed plane was flying minutes before it crashed. The Cincinnati Post quoted an unidentified Comair pilot on Friday as saying the Embraer 120 can suffer wing icing problems despite a system designed to break up ice through a pneumatic rubber strip on the wing that is inflated and deflated in bad weather. Michael Bragg, a professor of aeronautical and astronautical engineering at the University of Illinois in Champaign, told Reuters that some eyewitness accounts of the crash point to a ""classic horizontal tail stall."" Such stalls have long been considered a problem with smaller propjet planes, he said. Ice on the the horizontal part of the tale can disrupt the airflow that keeps a plane flying level. When flaps are deployed in such a situation, Bragg said, the plane stalls and dives. ","ToddNissen"
"Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co chairman and chief executive L.D. DeSimone said the company is comfortable with 1997 earnings estimates ranging from $4.05 to $4.20 per share for 1997. In an interview with Reuters Tuesday, DeSimone said, ""Within that range, at this point in time, we feel that there's nothing different we should say."" Profits in 1996 were $3.63 per share. DeSimone said the company is maintaining its target of earnings gains exceeding 10 percent annually.   ""Things can happen. The currency has gotten a lot worse,"" he said. ""But we think that up to this point, we've had some mitigation of that with all sorts of programs. But there's a limit there, too. We feel pretty good about fulfilling those kinds of numbers."" In remarks to industry analysts also made Tuesday, 3M chief financial officer Giulio Agostini said about 1,000 employees in the United States and Europe late in the fourth quarter of 1996 left 3M through voluntary separation. ""About an additional 500 people in Europe will depart 3M under similar programs in the first half of this year,"" he said.   Agostini said St. Paul, Minn.-based 3M expects raw materials prices to be slightly lower in 1997 than in 1996, ""producing a small benefit to cost of good sold."" He said capital spending for 1997 is expected to be about $1.3 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 1996. The total shares outstanding of 3M is expected to be reduced by about four million in 1997 from its level at the end of 1996 of 416.8 million, Agostini said. DeSimone said 30 percent of 3M's 1996 sales came from products introduced within the past four years, maintaining a traditional benchmark of the technology-based company.   3M said 10 percent of 1996 sales came from products introduced within the past 12 months. A more than 12-percent jump in fourth-quarter selling, general and administrative expense, compared to a jump for the entire year of only about half that, came on accounting adjustments and higher advertising costs, DeSimone said. ""We don't think that's continuing. What we see for SG&amp;A is a gradual decline to something a little under 25 percent of sales. We might get to that level over the next year, year-and-a-half,"" DeSimone said. The company's effective tax rate was 35.0 percent for the fourth quarter and 35.8 percent for 1996, ""slightly better than last year,"" Agostini said. ""We don't anticipate a significant change in our tax rate in 1997,"" he said. Shares in 3M were up 1-1/8 to 83-1/4 in late trading after the company reported fourth-quarter operating earnings of $0.90 per share, beating the First Call consensus estimate by $0.02. Earnings in the year-ago quarter were $0.63 per share on an operating basis. ""Volumes were encouragingly good. Margins were modestly weaker than I'd anticipated they might be relative to the revenue growth projection,"" said Schroder Wertheim analyst Michael Ellman. Overall, however, he said, ""Aggregate volume growth was 12 percent. That's smoking. That's darn good."" ((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787)) ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"The strength of the British pound hit results at Sedgwick Group Plc on Tuesday as the international insurance broker reported a fall in profits in the first three months of the year. Over the quarter, pre-tax profits slipped by 1.8 million pounds ($2.9 million) to 43.5 million pounds, with the strong pound knocking 3.4 million pounds off the figures. The company also announced it was seeking a listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange with trading expected to begin in June. Chairman Sax Riley said that with 40 percent of the group's business emanating from North America, the listing represented a logical step. Sedgwick's results followed a similar performance by British rival Willis Corroon last week which blamed the pound's strength for a five percent fall in first quarter profits. Excluding the impact of the currency Sedgwick pre-tax profits were up four percent on last year. The results were described as ""encouraging"" by Riley given the adverse effect of exchange rates and an increasingly weak insurance rating environment. Shares in Sedgwick firmed slightly on the results which broadly matched analyst expectations. By early afternoon, the shares were trading at 130-1/2 pence, an increase of two pence on the day. ""There were no real surprises. Sterling was factored in and there were no shocks there at all,"" commented one analyst. Merger talk continued to be in the background, he added, but there was no indication that there was any substance to continued speculation about a possible tie-up with British rival Willis. A series of mergers among rival firms has left both Sedgwick and willis trailing far behind industry giants Aon Corp and Marsh &amp; McLennan of the U.S. That has prompted speculation the two British companies may pursue a similar strategy in the drive for cost savings. ""The brokers are doing all the right things except making money. Noble Lowndes is doing well - that is one part of the business geared to grow. It is nice to see they're pushing hard at fee-based services. The rest of the business still looks pretty dull,"" said the analyst. There is an acceptance that rates would not recover in the short-term and that Sedgwick was not budgeting on assumptions of a hardening in rates, he said. Sedgwick's operational strategy has been focused on lessening the group's dependence on the underwriting cycle by increasing fee-earning consultancy business. It has also concentrated on broadening its business base and keeping a tight control on costs The company was looking to extend worldwide consultancy and outsourcing activities, said Riley, and would continue to look for new initiatives aimed at additional profit improvement and cost containment. ""We are confident that this strategy will enable us to make the most of our global network and brand, and to increase shareholder value,"" he added. The planned joint venture with Nikols, Italy's largest broker and the combination of the two companies' businesses in southern Europe and Latin America created opportunities for significant profit, he said. The plans are part of Sedgwick's strategy of strengthening its global operations and it was exploring further opportunities to develop its presence in continental Europe, it said.

"The decision by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd to buy three more Airbus Industrie A340 long range aircraft will increase the airline's air cargo opportunities, according to a senior Cathay cargo executive. Ray Jewell, cargo marketing and sales manager for Cathay Pacific Cargo, told Reuters in an interview that the new aircraft will be able to fly between 15 and 17 tonnes of belly space cargo plus passengers in normal weather conditions from Hong Kong to Toronto. Other possible destinations for the new aircraft from Hong Kong to Europe are still being studied, he added. The A340's ability to fly ultra-long distances will mean some existing routes become non stop destinations, Jewell said. ""These new aircraft will certainly help us on the air cargo side of things, there is no question about that. We are very pleased with our existing A340s which are very cargo friendly and fuel-efficient along with our Boeing 777s,"" Jewell said. Cathay currently have four A340-200 and three A340-300 in its fleet. The new Airbus A340-300 models are due to be delivered in the second and third quarters of 1998 to coincide with the opening of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok and increased flight schedules.

"On top of its domestic troubles, AT&amp;T Corp must now contend with new threats to its international strategy after Friday's defection of Spain's Telefonica into the rival British Telecom-MCI camp. ""They certainly have a lot of balls up in the air,"" Bear Stearns telecommunications analyst Bill Deatherage said, referring to the multiple battles facing AT&amp;T, the largest U.S. telephone company.   The international rebuff comes just ahead of AT&amp;T's first-quarter earnings report, slated for release Monday. Wall Street expectations are set low after the company's warning to financial analysts in early March that heavy investments in competitive initiatives would cause earnings in 1997 to fall substantially short of profit last year. Analysts on average expect AT&amp;T to post first-quarter earnings of $0.69 per share, down from $0.90 in the 1996 first quarter.   Analysts agree AT&amp;T's primary focus must remain on shoring up its domestic results, most of all in its core long-distance business, which is contending with market share losses to large long-distance rivals as well as smaller niche players. At the same time, it must gear up for the emerging competition in local phone and wireless communications services, they said. Nonetheless, global alliances are forming fast, and AT&amp;T is widely perceived to have been put on the defensive after recent moves by Concert, the British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp alliance.   On Friday, Telefonica de Espana SA said it struck an alliance with MCI and British Telecom, a move that is expected to open up the vast Latin American market for Concert. Later, AT&amp;T said Telefonica's new relationship was ""incompatible"" with the Spanish company's membership in the Unisource telecom alliance backed by AT&amp;T. The U.S.-based company said it expected to spend $8 billion to $9 billion this year -- mainly on new high-speed data networks and to expand wireless services -- which would dilute earnings by $0.75 to $1.00 per share.

"The agriculture ministry said on Tuesday it plans to privatise Budejovicky Budvar n.p., makers of Czech Budweiser beer, via a management buyout, after lengthy talks with Anheuser Busch Cos broke down last year. The head of the ministry's privatisation department, Jiri Stehlik, told Reuters that the plan would be to sell a 10 percent stake in Budvar to management with an option for them eventually to buy a further 41 percent. The plan comes after protracted talks broke down last September with Busch over use of the Budweiser trademark and the U.S. company's interest in a minority stake in Budvar, based in the southern Czech city of Budejovice (Budweis). The new plan fits the government's desire to privatise the makers of one of the country's most famous exports but keep the company primarily in Czech hands. ""This is the proposal of the (ministry), but the government decides on it, so it can change,"" Stehlik said. He said the plan did not include a foreign partner in the first stage of the privatisation process, but added that it did not exclude later entry of a foreign investor. Stehlik declined to give further details of the plan. Budvar, 100 percent state owned, is the maker of the Czech Budweiser, its flagship label. The beer is sold in many markets as Budvar. The Czech government had delayed privatisation of the company while trying to settle a trademark dispute with Anheuser Busch, maker of the U.S. Budweiser, which has been battling with the small Czech cousin for most of the century. The negotiations over the use of the ""Budweiser"" and ""Bud"" trademarks were aimed at resolving the row which prohibits the rivals from selling their labels in the other's key markets. But talks broke down last September when Anheuser-Busch said it would market its brew in much of Europe under the ""Bud"" name. Anheuser-Busch sells its beer under the Budweiser name in 11 European countries and under the ""Bud"" name in nine others. Budvar is one of the five largest Czech breweries, and Budweiser is one of the country's best-known exports. ""Budweiser"" beer has been brewed for centuries in the city known also by the German name Budweis, but the trademark was not registered by the Czechs until late last century, The trademark conflict with Anheuser-Busch, founded by German immigrants to the United States, began in 1911 when the American brewery first insisted that it had registered the brand name before the Czechs. The Czech government considers Budvar as a part of its ""family silver"" of strategic holdings. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"Former Archer Daniels Midland Co. executive Mark Whitacre, who acted as an informant in an antitrust investigation, filed suit on Monday against the Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who allegedly recruited him. In his suit, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Central District of Illinois, Whitacre charged FBI Agent Brian Shepard with allegedly violating his constitutional rights, inflicting emotional distress, and assault and battery. Because the suit targets Shepard in his official capacity as an agent, Whitacre is effectively suing the FBI, according to a legal expert. ""It would be tantamount to suing the whole FBI,"" said Chicago attorney James Shapiro, who is a former assistant U.S. Attorney. The FBI press office in Washington, as a matter of policy, declined to comment on Whitacre's lawsuit. ""We couldn't discuss or comment on pending litigation,"" an FBI spokesman said. A Justice Department spokesman was not immediately available, and an FBI spokesman in Springfield, Ill., also was not available for comment. The lawsuit is the latest twist in the legal tangle involving Whitacre, who said he acted as a government informant from 1992 through 1995 to assist in the Justice Department's antitrust probe of Decatur, Ill.-based Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's largest processors of corn and other crops. Whitacre had been president of ADM's BioProducts Division until he was fired in August 1995. ADM has charged that Whitacre allegedly stole about $9 million from it. Whitacre has denied those charges, saying he received the money in off-the-books payments that allegedly were authorised by ADM officials. In October 1996, as part of the antitrust probe, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of fixing prices of lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, which is used in food, beverages and other products. ADM agreed to pay $100 million in fines, a record for antitrust actions. In December 1996, Whitacre was indicted for allegedly conspiring to fix prices of lysine. Also indicted at that time were Michael Andreas, former vice chairman of ADM and son of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, a former group vice president. Whitacre, Michael Andreas and Wilson have pleaded not guilty to those charges. In his lawsuit, filed in Urbana, Ill., Whitacre said he had repeatedly discussed with Shepard a grant of immunity in exchange for cooperating with the antitrust investigation. Whitacre said he wanted to seek out an attorney regarding his role as a informer. He alleged that Shepard kept him from obtaining an attorney, in violation of his constitutional rights under the 1st and 5th Amendments. Whitacre also claimed in his lawsuit that there were episodes when Shepard allegedly became ""angry, shouted, directed abusive language"" toward him and threatened him with criminal prosecution if he sought the counsel of an attorney. In the lawsuit, Whitacre also claimed that in late February or early March 1993, Shepard allegedly struck him with a hard-sided briefcase. He further charged that Shepard kept him from seeking medical treatment for depression and suicidal tendencies, which exacerbated his manic depression. Whitacre said he attempted suicide on Aug. 9, 1995. Separately, in U.S. District Court in Chicago, Cheil Jedang Ltd. of Seoul, South Korea, entered a guilty plea to charges of fixing lysine prices. The company agreed to pay a $1.25 million fine, which was suspended until the end of the ADM litigation. ","PatriciaCommins"
"U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co dealt a blow to its Halewood plant in northwest England on Thursday, announcing 1,300 job cuts and apparently switching production of a new model to plants in Spain and Germany. Just months after giving the factory its global quality award for 1996, Ford told workers and their union leaders the new version of its mid-range Escort model would not be built at Halewood near Liverpool, an unempolyment blackspot. The proposed job cuts will reduce Halewood's workforce to just over 3,000, compared with a peak of 14,000 in the 1960s. The workers believe the new model, due in 1999, will be built instead at Ford's plants in Valencia, Spain, and Saarlouis, Germany. Ford has not said where the new model will be built. Angry trade unions, including the Transport and General Workers Union (TGW) and the AAEU, blamed the decision on what they see as a lack of legal protection for British workers. Britain has opted out of European Union's Social Chapter, which sets out working conditions, making it ""cheaper to dump labour in the UK than on the continent,""one union boss said. Ford attempted to soften the blow by saying Halewood could be the site to build a new vehicle, probably a multi-purpose people-carrier, but this remains at the concept stage. And Ford said that Halewood would continue to make the current Escort model through the year 2000. ""The actions we have announced today at Halewood assembly operations give the plant a realistic future, with an exciting new vehicle in the medium term, subject to approval and performance objectives being achieved,"" said David Gorman, European vehicle operations manager for Ford. ""We have had to take these steps to ensure our manned capacity is in line with our forecasts for sales,"" he said. Industry analysts said the failure of the Escort rather than problems at the plant were largely behind this decision. Ford of Europe is suffering mainly because people refuse to fall in love with the Escort-the small family car that competes with the Volkswagen Golf and Opel Astra, they said. ""People just didn't like the Escort. It was not as exciting as the competition, and Ford kept on having to revamp it,"" said Charles Young, director of Automotive Research at J.D.Power-LMC Automotive Forecasting. Ford Europe lost $472 million in the third quarter of 1996, up from a loss of $320 million in the same 1995 period. A Ford spokeswoman in Germany said the Halewood decision should be seen more in the context of Ford's continued over-capacity in Europe as a whole rather than in any purely national terms. Halewood workers pledged to fight the proposals, with the TGW describing them as ""morally unacceptable"" and threatening nationwide action. Union bosses said the Escort was a big seller in Britain and that some production should remain in the country. The local community, the Speke area of Liverpool, already suffers unemployment of up to 39 percent and its crime rate has worsened as businesses have pulled out, residents said. Landlord Mike Kelly of the Orient pub, the Ford workers' local, said, ""I don't think the government is interested in Liverpool."" ""I don't know how long this pub will be here now -- this place is becoming like a ghost town,"" he said. Local residents complained that shops, banks and supermarkets have closed as businesses moved out of the area, and saw the problem getting worse with the Ford news. Local Member of Parliament David Alton, an opposition Leberal Democract, told Reuters he had spoken to Ford, which said the jobs would be lost through voluntary redundancy. ""There's some good news in what they say as well -- that they're looking at Halewood as the probable European site for a planned new vehicle,"" Alton said. ""In Germany, if Ford closes its plant there, it has to pay its people 18 months pay in compensation. In the UK, we've got no Social Chapter, it's easier to shut us down,"" production line group leader Phil Gornall said. Larry Brook of the MSF union added: ""Britain is the cheapest place to dump labour. We are fighting for the future of Halewood."" Professor Garyl Rhys, a car industry expert at Cardiff University, said Halewood, now a model of industrial relations, was paying for the ""bad old days"" of the 1960s and 1970s, when the British car industry had a bad strike record. ""Because of the problems at Halewood and a number of other car plants in Britain, there was a reluctance to use them as sources for exports...You couldn't guarantee deliveries because of interruptions to production because of strikes,"" he said. Ford cars were, however, the three biggest sellers in Britain in 1996, with the Escort ranked number two behind the smaller Fiesta and ahead of the Mondeo. ","EdnaFernandes"
"Ford Motor Co. halted light truck assembly lines at three plants Friday as planned because of a strike at a seat supplier, but signed up another company to help it clear out the backlog of 7,700 Expeditions built without proper seats. Following an appeal from Ford Chairman Alex Trotman, Lear Corp. Chairman Kenneth Way agreed to have his company make seats for Ford's Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle once the walkout is settled, according to sources in the supply industry. Under the arrangement, Lear, which already is a large Ford supplier, would make second and third row seats for the Expedition, said Donna Parolini, president of International Business Development Corp., a consulting firm in Troy, Mich. Front seats for the vehicles are being made by Ford's Chesterfield, Mich., trim plant, Ford officials have said. Ford spokesman Bert Serre said the plant has been making a limited number of seats, less than 20 an hour. Ford suspended all production at its Michigan Assembly in Wayne, which makes the Expedition and F-Series pickup trucks, after the United Auto Workers and Johnson Controls Inc. failed to settle a strike, which entered its 11th day Friday. Ohio plants affected were the Econoline and Club Wagon full-size van assembly line in Lorain and a frame production line at Ohio Assembly in Avon Lake. About 6,800 workers were idled as a result of the action. Industry analysts said the strike has Ford in a huge bind. The Expedition is one of its most profitable and popular vehicles, earning Ford an estimated pre-tax profit of $10,000 each. Under normal production, it makes 840 vehicles at day Michigan Truck, the only plant where the Expedition is made. But to avoid angering its own UAW workers, Ford refused to accept seats made by non-union replacement workers. It had been making the vehicles with temporary seats. But after making about 14,800 Expeditions and Econolines without proper seats, Ford decided to shut production down completely. ""To interrupt Expedition production for any extended period of time would hurt Ford financially in North America,"" said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich. Because Ford and Lear do not want to provoke the UAW, Lear, which has unionized plants, would not start producing seats until the strike is over, said Parolini. Another issue prohibiting Lear from making seats immediately is the fact that it buys seat frames from the same Johnson Controls facility that assembles seats for Ford. Shutting down Expedition production means an extension of the three- to six-month wait that many consumers already face. Introduced last fall, the Expedition has been a huge hit with buyers looking for a sleek, larger sport utility. ""The reception of this vehicle has been the highest of anything I've seen since the original Mustang,"" said Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the largest Ford dealers in the country. About 500 UAW members struck Johnson Controls seat plants January 28 in Plymouth, Mich., and Oberlin, Ohio, when talks broke down on a new contract. Jeff Steiner, a spokesman for Johnson Controls' automotive unit, said no talks occurred Friday after they broke off late Thursday. No new negotiations were scheduled for the weekend. Steiner declined to characterize the discussions, which have restarted and collapsed several times since the strike began over terms for a new contract. ","ToddNissen"
"Hong Kong police are gearing up for all imaginable trouble during this year's handover to China -- from fireworks and street parades to protest rallies and guerrilla attacks, police said on Wednesday. Assistant police commissioner Lee Ming-kwai outlined plans to cope with an event that government officials have said will be the biggest international media spectacle since South Africa's 1994 post-apartheid elections. The centrepiece of the celebration around the handover is a joint Sino-British flag-changing ceremony at midnight on June 30 to be attended by about 4,000 dignitaries, including more than 60 well-known VIPs. Of these 60, about 30 are foreign ministers, with the remainder made up of former prime ministers and presidents or chief executives of major corporations, Lee said. About 7,200 journalists have registered to report on the event and police have been notified of more than 180 public celebrations. The mix of fireworks, street parades, demonstrations and large-scale ceremonies across notoriously crowded and congested Hong Kong is posing a logistical and security nightmare. ""We have difficulties because, I must say, this is a unique historical occasion,"" Lee told a news conference. ""A lot of people want to celebrate, a lot of people want to celebrate extravagantly or in large scale,"" he said. Police appealed through local media for cooperation from the British colony's 6.4 million population to ensure the huge jamboree celebrating its return to Chinese rule goes smoothly. Lee said about 2,000 officers will be at hand for the handover ceremonies with the remainder of the 28,000-member force, along with 5,000 auxiliaries, working in the community, where many local celebrations are planned. On Wednesday, police called on the public for early notification of public parties to allow coordination of events and keep the streets safe from clashes between different groups. A special police task force created to handle handover security started planning and training a few years ago. It is now bringing in X-ray machines, metal detector archways and explosives detectors along with extra explosives sniffer dogs and handlers to deal with the event. Lee stressed that the force was ready to confront even the most extreme scenario, including guerrilla attacks. ""We've got plans to handle that sort of situation,"" he said, responding to questions about recent bomb threats in Britain by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). ""I cannot envisage a picture the same as London. In terms of social order, in terms of crime rate, Hong Kong is in a far better position and there is no indication the IRA will come to Hong Kong and cause a problem,"" Lee said. ""But, of course, we have to take note and take precautions."" To gain experience, police travelled to a number of large-scale events, including World Bank meetings in Washington and Madrid, and four Conservative Party meetings in Britain, one of which was under heightened security because of an IRA threat. Hong Kong has had no history of terrorism since the left-wing riots of China's Cultural Revolution spilled into the territory in the 1960s. But in recent years, protests by pro-democracy groups have become common. There have also been bomb hoaxes recently, ostensibly by citizens upset by spiralling house prices. And last week, vandals damaged a new bridge which former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher is due to inaugurate on Sunday. ","SarahDavison"
"Japan's Finance Ministry served notice on Friday that it may take punitive action against Nomura Securities Co Ltd over suspected illegal deals involving a corporate client. Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference on Friday that the ministry would take strict measures, if necessary, after Japan's securities watchdog -- the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) -- completes its investigation into the dubious deals. Mitsuzuka said that it would be ""very regrettable"" if Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage, was involved in illegal trading as reported. On Thursday, Nomura publicly admitted that it was highly likely that two of its directors had been involved in illegal deals. At a hastily called news conference, Nomura vice president Atsushi Saito said that Nomura had found out that the directors made deals regarded as discretionary transactions with a corporate client, and they also transfered profits from Nomura's own account to the client's account. He said that both of the actions are illegal, and the SESC has been investigating the case. The revelations are yet another blot on the reputation of Japanese business, already hurt by scandals over unauthorised markets trading, shady oil deals and cosy contacts between bureaucrats, politicians and corporate executives. After the securities industry was hit by a scandal over compensating favoured clients for losses in the early 1990s, Japan banned brokers from making discretionary transaction contracts with clients as these give brokers free rein to make investment decisions.   Brokerage industry officials said any punishment would not be imminent and could possibly take the form of a suspension of Nomura business. Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities, said: ""Investigations take a long time to complete in the first place and as the market is at a crucial stage ahead of the end-March book closing, punishment measures will probably not be announced or carried out in a hurry."" A market source said that in the past, illegal activity by brokers has resulted in a partial business suspension as the functions of the trading section of the brokerage cannot be halted completely. However, there is a possibility that a more severe penalty, such as a suspension of buying and selling on Nomura's own account, could be imposed if the authorities conclude that illegal actions did take place, he said. Nomura shares fell in the wake of the news conference, finishing 50 yen lower at 1,530 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after being ask-only at the opening. But many analysts and market sources said that Nomura's business was unlikely to be greatly undermined by the news and that the stock price should prove resilient. They also said that that the market had to some extent digested the scandal as the media reported on the suspected impropriety last year. ""I've told our boys it's great buy opportunity,"" said one foreign analyst. Another securities analyst, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson International's Robert Garone, said: ""This is not devastating for Nomura or the brokerage industry."" Ayako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd, said, however: ""I reviewed the rating for Nomura after yesterday's news and reduced it to neutral from buy."" She said that the topside of Nomura's shares would be heavy for a while until the stock market fully digests any punishment imposed on Nomura by regulators and its impact, if any, on Nomura's business. But she said it was unlikely Nomura would lose its top ranking among Japanese brokerages. ""I don't think Nomura will fall from the current top position even in the long term,"" she said. But any change in top management at the brokerage may hamper Nomura's ability to take swift, proactive steps to deal with Japan's ""Big Bang"" financial reforms, she added. ","FumikoFujisaki"
"IBM Corp's Czech unit said on Monday it would appeal against a Defence Ministry decision to award a 1.3 billion crown ($45 million) deal to deliver an information system to a consortium of EDS and Digital Equipment Corp. IBM said in a statement that EDS-Digital did not fulfil a tender condition that stipulated participation of only those companies which had accomplished projects in the Czech Republic to a similar extent. ""There are a number of reasons why we are appealing, we are still working on it,"" said IBM's spokesman Michal Urvalek. He declined to give more information on the appeal. The IBM move comes on the heels of Unisys Corp's announcement on Thursday that it too would appeal the decision. Any appeals must be delivered to the ministry this week. IBM placed third in the eyes of an 11-member committee evaluating bidders in the tender, behind Unisys which came in first and EDS-Digital, which won the contract after the ministry decided not to follow ratings. Implementation of the staff information system is seen as a large step on the path to make the Czech army more compatible with armed forces of NATO countries, but finding its supplier has been a struggle. Unisys won an original four billion crown supply tender which was annulled last year after Czech competition authorities found irregularities in the process. The original tender was cancelled by the Defence Ministry, but the former Ministry for Economic Competition intervened and cancelled that decision before ordering a new tender itself. Unisys and IDOM, a unit of Deloitte and Touche, were ousted from the new tender earlier this year for application violations, but were later allowed to re-enter the competition. Unisys denied the mistakes, as revealed by the ministry, ever happened. In announcing the winner, Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny said the technical quality of EDS-Digital and Unisys bids was almost identical, but EDS was chosen because its offer was 109 million crowns cheaper. After Vyborny's announcement, Unisys immediately said it would appeal to the Economic Competition Office if necessary. On Monday Unisys officials added they could not rule out a request for police to investigate the tender proceedings. ""Our lawyers are investigating this possibility...but it is priority number two, a step after other possibilities fail,"" said Jiri Nykodym of Unisys's Czech unit. Unisys said Vyborny was wrong to take the decision since under tender rules, price should have been a decisive factor only if two bidders received identical scores from the commission. ""The tender rules were broken and in fact, the way of evaluation of bids was changed in the course of the tender at the moment when it became clear that...Unisys would have won the tender for the second time,"" Nykodym said. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003 ($ = 29.14 Czech Crowns) ","JanLopatka"
"Boeing Co. stock surged Tuesday after the company decided to scrap plans to build a costly stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet. Boeing shares jumped $5.625 to a record $112.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, accounting for much of the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is one of 30 stocks in the index of blue-chip companies. Industry analysts estimated the move by the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, announced late on Monday, could reduce Boeing's research and development costs by more than $2 billion over the next five years and boost annual earnings by as much as $1 a share. NatWest Securities analyst Nick Heymann said the decision not to proceed with the risky project removed a cloud of uncertainty over Boeing as it ramps up production to meet rising demand and prepares to complete its planned $14 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp. ""It's fantastic news,"" he said. While officials at Boeing rival Airbus Industrie said the European consortium would go ahead with plans for an all-new superjumbo jetliner called the A-3XX, Heymann said he thought that project was dead. ""Airbus never really had the resources to go ahead with their aircraft,"" Heymann said. He said it was even less likely the European consortium could raise the funds now that Boeing has talked with the same customers and determined market conditions did not justify the investment needed for a new big jet. Boeing said it would cost more than $7 billion just to develop a new wing and make other changes needed to produce two new versions of the 747 that would add range and capacity. Airbus has said it can develop and all-new jet for $8 billion, but analysts peg the total costs at closer to a whopping $15 billion. Citing increasing ""route fragmentation,"" especially across the Pacific Ocean, Boeing said it plans to focus its development efforts on new versions of the medium-sized 767 and 777 twin-engine models. Boeing already has begun offering an increased-capacity version of the 767 that could be launched with an initial order in the next few months. Boeing also is considering new versions of the 777 that would add both capacity and range. Heymann said Boeing also plans minor changes in the 747 including new digital cockpit electronics and computer software. The revamped plane would be the same size with the same range as the current 747-400, Boeing's latest version of the four-engine plane. Alfred Goldman, a stock market analyst at brokers A.G. Edwards and Sons, said the rise in Boeing stock accounted for nearly half of the Dow's rise of about 34 points, to 6,878, at midday. ","MartinWolk"
"John Major's Conservatives can no longer rely on the loyal support of much of Britain's press to help deliver the votes needed to secure a fifth successive election victory, editors and political analysts say. ""It's the Sun wot won it,"" Rupert Murdoch's top-selling tabloid trumpeted after Major's ruling party defied the opinion polls and secured a slim 21-seat majority in 1992. Traditionally pro-Conservative newspapers, some 70 percent of Britain's press, threw their full weight behind Major five years ago, rubbishing opposition leader Neil Kinnock at every turn and warning voters not to trust Labour's promises. ""If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights,"" was the Sun's election day message, illustrated with a front-page picture of the Labour leader's head framed in a lightbulb. But media watchers believe that Major is unlikely to enjoy such unequivocal support against Labour's Tony Blair in an election which the prime minister announced on Monday would be held on May 1. Labour has a big lead in opinion polls. ""It won't be possible for the Sun to be as enthusiastic about Major and negative about Blair as they were about Major and Kinnock last time around,"" said Ian Hargreaves, former editor of the Independent newspaper. ""They have poured so much crap on Major's head that it wouldn't be possible to back him enthusiastically and retain credibility with their readers,"" added Hargreaves, who now edits the left-leaning New Statesman magazine. Kinnock was portrayed as volatile and untrustworthy by much of the press in the last campaign. Blair is a media-savvy moderate who has taken his party to the centre ground since becoming leader in July 1994 and is a harder target to attack. Major's battle to keep his party together over future relations with the European Union has reduced his standing among the pro-Conservative newspapers, many of which demandi a stronger anti-European line. ""It would be inconceivable and a mistake for the Sun not to deliver its vote but it might not be done with the rasping clarity we have come to know and love,"" Hargreaves added. ""I would expect the Sun to be pro-Tory but I think the tone may be that of a 'plague on both your houses'. I think that might be something you see in quite a bit of the press."" POLITICAL BIAS British newspapers wear their political sympathies on their sleeves, not only writing trenchant editorials but also slanting their news coverage in a way that amazes many foreign readers. The support is important as newspaper circulation remains high in Britain. The combined circulation of the national dailies has been in gradual decline but still tops 14 million each day. Among the mass-market tabloids, the Daily Mirror and its Scottish sister the Daily Record were alone in backing Labour in 1992. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both stuck to their customary pro-Conservative line, as of course did the Sun. Among the broadsheet ""quality"" press, Murdoch's Times and Canadian Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph both backed the government while the Guardian supported Labour and the Independent lived up to its name by remaining broadly neutral. Most surprising of all was an election day editorial in favour of Labour from the Financial Times, the daily staple of business people. Blair understands the power of the press and provoked controversy in 1995 when he accepted an invitation to address a conference organised by Murdoch's News Corp in Australia, the media magnate's homeland. The Labour leader has dined with several newspaper proprietors and editors who have reacted with warm words to Blair. But Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell still believes he is ""dealing with a press that basically wants to do us in if it can"". MURDOCH'S INFLUENCE Murdoch's influence over the British press is hard to overstate, his News International arm controlling around 35 percent of the market through its ownership of the Sun, the Times and Sunday titles News of the World and Sunday Times. ""Labour are haunted by the Sun 'light-bulb' front page and are determined to avoid a repetition of that,"" said Andrew Jaspan, former editor of Britain's Observer newspaper, commenting on Blair's efforts to build bridges with Murdoch. There has been speculation that some of the News International stable may come out and back Blair. Campbell says the Sun and the Daily Mail, often called the voice of Middle England, are the most important papers for his party but he is cautious about the chances of their endorsement. ""I don't think even the most zealous right-wingers in those papers want to get back to where they were with Neil Kinnock,"" he said. ""Having said that, I've always said that if we could actually win the endorsement of a paper whose endorsement we didn't have at the last election, that would be a huge bonus."" The mid-market Express, known as a ""Conservative party cheer leader"", is one possibility. United News &amp; Media, the paper's parent company, is now controlled by Labour supporting peer Lord Hollick, nicknamed ""The Red Baron"". ABILITY OF MEDIA TO SWING VOTES IN DOUBT Despite the anecdotal evidence and the Sun's claims, there is some doubt about the extent to which newspapers are able to affect voting patterns although opinion polls show readers of the Telegraph, Times and Sun are increasingly turning to Labour. ""It does look as if the tabloids are able to swing people and the Sun seems better at doing this than the Mirror,"" said Bill Miller, politics professor at Glasgow University. ""Mirror readers are more likely to be politically committed whereas the majority of Sun readers are not political animals and more open to influence,"" he said. But Miller, who has studied the effects of newspapers on voting, said the importance of the press can be overstated. He notes that the Sun, for example, sells only four million copies in a nation of 35 million voters. ""There is a net influence -- perhaps a swing of one percent which last time would have made the difference between Major's majority and a hung parliament."" But he said that this was not enough to affect the 15 to 20 percentage point lead which Labour holds in most opinion polls. ""If you want to annoy an incoming government you must expect to bear the consequences. It may be that the classic Tory tabloids realise this is not the election for them,"" he said. ","KeithWeir"
"Media mogul Rupert Murdoch treks to Capitol Hill Thursday to make a public pitch for his $1 billion Sky satellite-broadcast venture as a powerful new competitor to cable television. ""He's going to sound like the saviour. He's going to present himself like the saviour. Members of Congress will watch and applaud. But we'd better watch our wallets,"" said Stephen Effros, president of the Cable Telecommunications Association, a trade group representing cable operators. Murdoch has been lobbying Congress to pass legislation that would benefit his new venture, to be formed through a 50 percent stake in Colorado-based EchoStar Communications Corp. On Thursday he is expected to appeal to a Senate Commerce Committee hearing for help to make Sky a potent force to cable operators, whose subscription rates have leaped at more than double the rate of inflation over the past year. Cable companies are worried -- insiders have dubbed Sky ""Deathstar"" -- and the industry is rallying to battle the Murdoch venture on the legislative and regulatory fronts. Effros complained that Murdoch is trying to ""violate every public policy in this country to protect against the power he's accumulating."" A spokesman for Murdoch's News Corp. was not available to comment. Sky is set to be running in early 1998. It is expected to offer more than 500 channels of high-quality digital TV, Internet services, and retransmission of local TV broadcasts representing more than 75 percent of U.S. TV households. Direct broadcast satellite operators -- whose customers receive the service over a pizza-sized dish -- have nearly 5 million subscribers, up from practically zero three years ago. Murdoch and other satellite broadcast companies want a big chunk of the cable industry's 65 million subscribers. Industry analysts believe Murdoch is in a position to do so. ""He comes in with a lot of motivation, a lot of capital, a lot of experience, and a lot of chutzpah,"" said analyst Jimmy Schaeffler of The Carmel Group in Carmel, Calif. Murdoch also is using his political weight to convince lawmakers to pass legislation to clarify the copyright laws so Sky can retransmit local TV station signals to its customers. Other satellite broadcast companies do not provide the broadcasts. To outflank opponents, Murdoch wants to attach the measure to a must-pass $4 billion spending package that appropriates money for U.S. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and disaster relief, according to congressional and industry sources. The effort has run into opposition from lawmakers such as Representative Thomas Bliley, R-Va. The commerce committee chairman wants the measure to go through the normal -- and longer -- legislative channels involving committee hearings and votes. ""Bliley has dug in his heels. And it doesn't sound like its negotiable,"" said a congressional aide. In any event, Murdoch's testimony Thursday could get a sympathetic reception from lawmakers anxious to jump-start competition after last year's big communications bill. Competition in the cable business suffered after big phone companies scaled back plans to offer cable TV. Meanwhile, cable rates jumped 8.2 percent in the 12 months ended in February -- vs. a 3 percent rise in consumer prices. ""There's no competing service that has functioned at a level to cause cable rates to decrease,"" said Mark Buse, an aide to Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican. Buse said McCain, who chairs the commerce committee, has met with Murdoch and ""believes there is an an awful lot of validity to what Mr. Murdoch is trying to achieve."" In a preview of Thursday's hearing, cable industry officials insist they face competition from the likes of satellite broadcasters, regional Baby Bell Ameritech Corp. and now Murdoch's Sky. ""Cable is facing some very real competition already,"" said Torie Clarke of the National Cable Television Association. ","RogerFillion"
"China's Deng Xiaoping launched the greatest economic boom on earth and justified his reforms to doubting Marxist ideologues with one deceptively simple phrase. The maxim that Deng used as an ideological figleaf to cover his near-heretical treatment of Marxist economics was ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"". The phrase that would justify private enterprise, ownership of property and lifting of price controls in a state run by the Communist Party saw the light of day in Deng's opening speech to the 12th party congress on September 1, 1982. ""We must integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of China, blaze a path of our own and build a socialism with Chinese characteristics -- that is the basic conclusion we have reached after summing up long historical experience,"" Deng told the elders of the central committee. The congress was crucial for Deng's nascent economic reforms, already running into resistance from his orthodox Marxist colleagues who feared -- rightly as it turned out -- that his employment of market forces would erode three decades of Stalinist command economics. ""Deng's greatest contribution of all was that simple phrase 'Chinese characteristics',"" said one Western diplomat. ""It ensured that you could do anything you thought was appropriate. It should be engraved on his tomb."" That single phrase enabled Deng to dump the revolutionary fervour nurtured by the late chairman Mao Zedong in favour of doing pretty much what he wanted. ""This was a huge leap forward compared with the Mao era,"" said a Chinese political scientist. ""This sentence guided China on to the path of modernisation. It marked the shift from Mao's path to Deng's path and enabled Deng to do an enormous number of things."" It ended the sole system of public ownership. Collective and private enterprises were born. It also ended cradle-to-grave care and control by the party. Chinese could be sacked, they could resign. They were free to find their own jobs. They could move house. They had to pay for their own education and medical care. The command economy gave way to market forces. What Deng created was no longer socialism, neither was it capitalism. It was somewhere in between. It was socialism with Chinese characteristics. ","JaneMacartney"
"Ivory Coast plans to discuss further reform of its cocoa industry in May, officials said on Monday. This follows a review by a committee of industry, donor and Ivorian delegates on February 5-7 which identified quality and marketing problems. ""The Prime Minister attaches great importance to the deliberations of this committee and its conclusions,"" Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze said afterwards, adding that the state Caistab marketing body would retain a role in future. ""The state must retain a quality control role,"" he added, saying no solutions to concerns had been agreed but that proposals would be discussed in May. ""The product must be stamped with an Ivory Coast quality label."" Findings of the consultative committee -- set up in October and chaired by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan's technical adviser Philippe Mian -- would be considered at cabinet level before May. A government statement released after the private talks gave no details of discussions but said prices, quality, the auctions, cocoa conditioning and fixed contracts had been on the agenda. World Bank officials, seen before the talks as opposing changes to the rules governing Ivorian cocoa auctions, said they would reconsider ideas put forward by exporters. ""There will be another ASAC (World Bank Agricultural Sector Adjustment loan) meeting in April,"" World Bank spokesman Jean-Claude Balcet said on Friday. Cocoa and coffee sector liberalisation linked to an earlier $150 million ASAC loan led to the introduction of an export auction system that the industry believes encourages overbidding for contracts. Donors want a sharp reduction in the role played by the Caistab, which until 1994 monopolised internal and external marketing and whose functions now include setting guide farm gate prices. ""The Caistab still has substance,"" Gauze said. ""There has been a dispersal of its activities and we are now attempting to re-centre them.' He added, ""It is the government which forms policy and the Caistab which effects a marketing plan."" Exporters want the Caistab to act as a trade service, providing quality assurance, trade information and statistics. Government ministers recently said that Caistab statistics were not reliable. Ivory Coast only carries out port cocoa quality checks, but proposals for detailed checks from farm to port are expected to be put forward in May. ""Quality is the name of the game,"" Netherlands Cocoa Association managing director Loouis Bensdorp said on Friday. Amsterdam expects to receive 350,000 tonnes of cocoa in bulk rather that in bagged form next year in response to the requirements of large processors. One shipping line manager told Reuters up to 50 percent of Ivorian cocoa could soon be shipped in bulk. But this would mean quality and origin would be harder to monitor. Liberalisation of cocoa and coffee markets in Cameroon and Nigeria led to the emergence of a large numbers of inexperienced operators and a loss of quality premiums. -- Abidjan + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said if the rapid expansion in the country's current account deficit does not subside by the end of next year, a devaluation of the crown might be needed. Speaking on Czech Television late on Wednesday, Dlouhy repeated government policy that a devaluation is currently not necessary to boost exports and stem the current account defict forecast at 5 to 6 percent of gross domestic product this year. In a panel discussion, Dlouhy was asked whether he could see the need for a devaluation of the crown in the future, if the deficit kept growing. ""If (growth in the deficit) doesn't stop, then I think at the turn of 1997-98 it will be the time when you will correctly push me into more emphatic measures of the types that I would not like to take, like a devaluation,"" he said. Some independent economists have suggested that a nominal devaluation in the currency might be needed if the record trade deficit does not subside. But the government and other economists have said that net capital inflow, plus tourism and services revenue should comfortably pay for a merchandise trade deficit which grew to 85.3 billion crowns in the first seven months of 1996. That compares with a 49.5 billion crown trade deficit for the same period last year. ""I would like to see a stabilisation of the increase of the deficit during the first half of next year,"" Dlouhy said. ""If it ranges around five percent of GDP, this economy, with its revenue from tourism and services, is capable of financing it."" Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and central bank governor Josef Tosovsky have both recently ruled out a devaluation. Tosovsky said a strong crown would force companies to be more efficient. The comments sent the crown to its all-time high last Friday against the mark/dollar basket to which it is pegged each day, but profit taking has eased the currency a bit in recent days. Dlouhy added that he is strongly against protectionist measures, but would seek to use other tools to help the trade balance. ""I will never agree with (an) import surcharge or higher protectionism, but I will agree with using the relevant legislative tools like the anti-dumping law, stricter (quality) controls, and more money for pro-export policy,"" Dlouhy said. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JohnMastrini"
"The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) signed an agreement on Thursday to hook up the Hong Kong Futures Exchange (HKFE) to its NYMEX ACCESS trading system, a move that may challenge Singapore's trading headstart. Officials from both exchanges said Hong Kong's cash trading base and trading expertise could not compare with Singapore's, especially in the energy field, but rising oil and metals use in Asia, particularly China, would see a growing demand for risk management and hedging opportunities. ""I see great potential in China, refineries in South Korea and the rest of Asia, potential that provides the key to this (linkage),"" NYMEX president Patrick Thompson said at a news conference after the agreement was signed in Hong Kong. The link with Hong Kong, expected to go into operation around the end of March 1997, would allow HKFE members to trade existing NYMEX futures and options contracts on the ACCESS system during local Hong Kong trading hours under a mutual-offset system. The agreement with the HKFE seemed to throw into doubt NYMEX's intention expressed in 1994 to cooperate with the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX), where two energy contracts already trade, albeit sluggishly. While officials of the exchanges denied that rivalry with Singapore had catapulted Hong Kong into Thursday's deal, Thompson suggested the linkup with Hong Kong -- and with Sydney in 1995 -- would render a linkup with SIMEX more unlikely. ""Talks are progressing very, very slowly and Singapore is certainly not as much of a priority with us now as previously,"" Thompson said, adding the deal with the HKFE would introduce constraints that would affect any future deal with SIMEX. SIMEX would also be cut out of any new futures and options contracts that NYMEX was working to introduce in Asia with the help of a newly formed Oil Advisory Committee. The committee, made up of 30 members from Asia's oil community, would work out new contracts tailored to physical products traded in the region in terms of pricing and quality. The first meeting, held last week in Singapore, brought together representatives from state oil companies, major oil players, Wall Street traders and top brokers, all of whom were eager to see the introduction of new oil futures contracts. ""We were gratified by the interest shown...and the unanimous crying need for new products,"" Thompson said, adding new contracts would be launched not with SIMEX but with the HKSE. New crude and gas oil (diesel) futures contracts received overwhelming votes from the committee, but more meetings would be held to determine the type and specifications of the new product as well as its pricing formula, Thompson said. NYMEX, the world's largest physical commodity exchange, offers contracts on the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude, heating oil, natural gas and unleaded gasoline on its energy complex and gold, silver and copper on the metals complex. NYMEX, together with its COMEX division, trades a daily volume of 310,000 contracts each day during day trading hours. Its overnight ACCESS system rakes in around 5,000 contracts each night, and the volume has risen between 25 to 30 percent each year since it was launched in 1993. Hong Kong would be the fifth location where ACCESS trades can be executed, after New York, Sydney, Chicago and London. NYMEX officials will visit Hong Kong in coming months to train exchange members in energy and metals futures trading, said Ivers Riley, chief of the HKFE. -- Hong Kong newsroom +852 2843 6441 ","TanEeLyn"
"Czech politicians are struggling to overcome scepticism about the merits of NATO membership, with opinion polls consistently showing Czechs the coolest of the central European frontrunners towards joining the bloc. While surveys show a majority of Hungarians and Poles in favour of joining the alliance, they say less than 40 percent of Czech citizens back NATO membership. ""Many consider NATO to be just military manoeuvres around Europe, and maybe it is our fault that we haven't been able to explain the importance in the solidarity of values,"" Czech Senate Chairman Petr Pithart told Reuters in an interview. But Pithart, elected to chair the new upper house of parliament in December, also believes there is a lingering lack of respect for the army which would make a referendum on NATO membership, sought by the political opposition, irrelevant. ""The relationship to NATO, the less strong will here compared with Poland or Hungary or wherever, is evidently for me more a result of the scepticism against the army of the Czech republic than against NATO,"" Pithart said on Thursday. The Czechs, along with Poland and Hungary, are widely expected to be invited to join NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) at a summit of member states in July. NATO membership has been the top foreign policy aspiration of the Czech government, along with joining the European Union. Disdain for the Czech army built up after World War Two and during 40 years of communism, when many Czechs saw the military as subservient to Moscow. Opinion polls also show that many people are simply tired of being tied to a military bloc. Pithart, who was the Czech Republic's first post-Communist prime minister and is now affiliated to the centre-right Christian Democrats, is joined in his opposition to a referendum on NATO by the conservative current Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. But the chairman of the lower house, Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman, has joined ultra-right and Communist members of parliament in calling for a referendum, although he says he and his opposition party are in favour of joining NATO. ""Certainly to be against holding a referendum is dangerous because it indicates you feel a majority of people are against (NATO membership),"" said Pithart, a political scientist and leading dissident under Communism. ""But to use (a referendum), which we've never used in the political tradition of this country, is absurd."" Pithart said Czech politicians must start rebuilding the prestige of the military by pointing out the army's solid performance with NATO in the IFOR and SFOR missions in Bosnia. ""Because in our modern history one of the major casualties is that the army has somewhat lost prestige and...respect,"" Pithart said. Echoing a favourite theme of his friend, President Vaclav Havel, Pithart said it was necessary to also stress the non-military underpinnings of NATO representing a family of democratic nations in Europe.

"Convinced there is no quick end in sight to a crippling seat supplier strike, Ford Motor Co. said Monday it was moving ahead with a plan to resume production of its Expedition full-size sport utilty vehicle with seats from another company. Ford hopes to finalize its restart efforts by the middle or end of this week, said spokesman Bert Serre. Lear Corp., the substitute seat supplier, plans to start making the seats later this week. The automaker halted production of the Expedition and Econoline and Club Wagon full-size vans early Friday afternoon, idling 6,800 workers in Michigan and Ohio. Ford had hoped a 14-day strike by about 500 United Auto Workers union members at two Johnson Controls Inc. seat plants would be settled. In deference to its own union workforce, Ford refused to accept seats made by non-union replacements. Ford, however, made 7,700 Expeditions and 7,100 Econolines without seats, before it ran out of storage room and grew concerned over Johnson Controls' ability to meet the backlog and regular production demand. Over the weekend, Ford made its own labor negtiators available to help resolve the dispute. ""From our position, we're disappointed that Johnson Controls and the UAW haven't been able to reach a settlement. We've done everything we could,"" said Serre. ""Now, we've made the decision to act."" The seat agreement with Lear is a temporary one, company officials said. Lear spokeswoman Leslie Touma would not disclose what Detroit area plant will make the seats. Touma also declined to comment on what reaction Lear's unionized workers might have to the company's decision. ""Ford is a valued Lear customer, and we're trying to help them out during this time,"" she said. Ford will first focus on putting seats in new Expeditions built once production resumes, said Serre. It will then turn its attention to the backlog of Expeditions built without seats. The Expedition is one of Ford's most profitable vehicles, generating an estimated $10,000 in pre-tax profits, according to analysts. Johnson Controls and the UAW have not held discussions since Thursday, and none are scheduled, Steiner said. The two sides are at odds over terms for a new contract. ","ToddNissen"
"Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) said it set four new handling records during the territory's pre-Christmas peak season in December. HACTL managing director Anthony Charter told Reuters that imports were especially strong when new daily, weekly and monthly records were set. A new daily import handling record of 2,661 tonnes was set on December 26, according to HACTL's performance records. ""The daily tonnage record (for the after Christmas) is most unusual. Imports into China have been very strong, noticeably machinery,"" Charter said. A new weekly import record of 15,720 tonnes was also recorded between December 16 and 22. December as a whole was also a record month for imports with 67,572 tonnes landing at Kai Tak airport. December 15 also saw a new daily record being set for both imports and exports combined of 5,788 tonnes, HACTL figures show. Charter said HACTL's long range forecast is for 8 per cent growth this year and he personally thinks it may reach 10 per cent. ""We have all been surprised by the trends of the last three or four months and there is not much to indicate a slowdown for the next six months,"" Charter added.

"Financial services group Cater Allen said on Friday its purchase of Glasgow-based stockbroker Aitken Campbell from Union Plc would complement its existing activities in share dealing and stock lending. ""We already have a number of allied operations like City Deal and in Cater Allen we have a significant stock lending operation,"" Cater's managing director David White said in an interview. White declined to divulge the price of Aitken Campbell but said the amount was not significant and that, while contracts remained to be signed, both sides had sought to reassure both the market and Aitken staff by making an announcement. ""Aitken fits in quite nicely with City Deal and will be a sister company, we're not merging it into anything,"" White added. He also noted one of the attractions of Aitken Campbell was that it runs one of only four electronic trading systems in the market -- the others belong to BZW, Kleinwort Benson and Merrill Lynch. Cater still maintains its discount house and other money market activities and has also moved into fund management. Union announced on February 25 that it was at an advanced stage in talks to sell Aitken Campbell as part of a major reorganisation, which saw the historic firm give up its role as a money market counterparty to the Bank of England. Union is thought to have received a bid approach for the rest of the company, mainly an asset play based on its banking licence and desirable headquarters building in the heart of the City, from millionaire Joe Lewis who already owns 24 percent of Union. Caribbean-based Lewis recently hit the headlines by investing 40 million stg in football club Glasgow Rangers.

"The battle for Thomson-CSF heated up on Wednesday as the French government announced terms for its privatisation and rival companies made clear they would fight for control of the profitable defence electronics firm. The sale, part of the state's restructuring of France's defence industry around a few ""national champions"" as a step towards wider European consolidation, has dragged on for months and provoked bitter public opposition, but the government and bidders forged ahead on Wednesday. As expected, books-to-missiles conglomerate Lagardere made clear its intention to bid and engineering group Alcatel Alsthom said it planned a joint offer with combat plane maker Dassault Industries. Both bidders said their offers would allow for far-reaching co-operation with state-owned aircraft and defence company Aerospatiale, a necessity since Aerospatiale and Thomson already co-operate on many projects. ""Like all the candidates, we are ready to take into account the business electronics and defence activities of Aerospatiale in our industrial plan, with the sole concern, for us, of strengthening Thomson-CSF,"" Lagardere said. Alcatel and Dassault said they were pleased by the government's statement Aerospatiale was directly concerned by a defence sector restructuring resulting from Thomson-CSF's sale. ""This confirms the industrial logic elaborated by Alcatel and Dassault, whose plan develops the possibility of major cooperation between Aerospatiale and a privatised Thomson-CSF,"" the joint Alcatel-Dassault statement said. On Tuesday, the government excluded Aerospatiale from the bidding because it is state-owned. It has previously said it planned to merge Dassault and Aerospatiale later this year. The government's announcement of terms and conditions marks its second attempt to sell Thomson-CSF through a private sale after a first effort failed last year when the state tried to privatise it as part of the Thomson SA electronics group. France's Privatisation Commission thwarted the government's first attempt to sell Thomson SA last year to Lagardere, which planned to hold onto Thomson-CSF and sell loss-making Thomson Multimedia unit to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea for a symbolic franc. On Tuesday the government said the successful bidder would become the majority owner by acquiring more than 50 percent of Thomson-CSF's capital and voting rights. In the case of a group bid, the lead company must plan to hold more than a third of Thomson-CSF's capital and voting rights, the Finance Ministry statement said. The government hopes to pick the winning bid by June 30. Firms bidding must have at least five billion francs ($868 million) in equity capital and the same amount in 1995 turnover in non-consumer and defence electronics, it said on Wednesday. The government repeated it would hold a ""golden share"" which gives it an effective veto over changes in ownership to protect the state's strategic defence interests. Bidders must declare themselves by 1100 GMT on March 28. The Finance Ministry would tell the candidates whether they were eligible within five working days, the ministry said. Offers must be delivered by 1100 GMT on May 7 and bidders must make an irrevocable offer to buy Thomson-CSF within four months of that date. In a group bid, the partners must set out planned individual holdings and the contractual relations that exist between the companies, the statement said. Thomson-CSF's capital consists of 119.5 million shares, of which 41.7 percent is in public hands. The rest is owned by Thomson SA and Sofivision, with the state holding one share. Thomson SA is state-controlled. Some 6.65 million Thomson-CSF shares will be reserved for employees and former staff. ","PierreTran"
"A leasing unit of HSBC Holdings Plc said on Wednesday it would buy recently-privatised British train rolling stock leasing company Eversholt in a politically controversial deal worth 726.5 million pounds ($1.2 billion). HSBC said its Forward Trust Group financing unit, part of retail banking group Midland Bank plc, would buy Eversholt's shares from their venture capital-backed management owners for 453.4 million pounds and repay debt of 273.1 million pounds. The widely-leaked Eversholt deal has been heavily criticised by opposition politicians. Labour Party leader Tony Blair on Tuesday said the profits likely to flow to some members of its management was ""entirely unjustified"". Blair, who is preparing to fight a general election due in the next three months, said in Parliament that the level of gains anticipated for managers after just 14 months as owners of the company could be seen as ""profiteering"". However, Blair's allegations were based on claims that the deal would be done for 900 million pounds rather than the 726.5 million disclosed today. Eversholt was bought from the government for 580 million pounds. The Labour party said it would publish a dossier showing how ""fat cats have hit the rail privatisation jackpot"" at a news conference later on Wednesday. Graham Picken, chief executive of Forward Trust, said it had paid a fair market price for Eversholt and refused to comment on how much money Eversholt's directors might have made on the deal. ""As far as we are concerned, we were presented with the opportunity late last year,"" Picken said in an interview, ""and, after due diligence, we are paying a fair market price."" Venture capital backer Candover Investments plc said in a separate statement that its 17.7 million pound investment in Eversholt had increased in value to 100.4 million pounds as a result of the sale. Blair attacked the large sums that Eversholt directors would make on the, saying that its managing director Andrew Jukes was set to make 20 million pounds on an investment of 110,000 pounds. Picken said the purchase of Eversholt was a natural expansion and excellent fit for Forward Trust which has been providing finance to the automotive and rail industries since 1928. He said there were substantial opportunities for growth in the business, especially in the area of new rolling stock which the train operating companies will require. ""We believe that the combination of our financial skills and the railway and engineering expertise of Eversholt will make this work,"" Picken added. Picken foresaw healthy competition in the sector and said new entrants could emerge, although Forward Trust was not planning any further acquisitions. ""We are not opportunistic, leasing is a core area and we are making a long-term commitment,"" Picken said. ","JoeOrtiz"
"Mercury Finance Co.'s woes deepened Friday when the company said it would be unable to pay $17 million in commercial debt due the same day, and its stock lost nearly 90 percent of its value. The stock lost $13 to $1.875 on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of more than 27 million shares after it opened for trading Friday afternoon for the first time since Tuesday. It fell as low as $1.625. Based on the more than 172 million shares outstanding as of early November, that would mean a loss of more than $2.2 billion in market capitalisaiton for the company. On Wednesday, the company said it found problems in its bookkeeping that caused it to overstate earnings by $90 million over four years. The consumer finance company said Friday that as a result of downgrades from several debt rating services, it would not be able to issue new short-term debt, known as commercial paper, to repay maturing debt and could not make the payments due Friday. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Fitch Investors Service downgraded the company's commercial paper to a default rating. Lake Forest, Ill.-based Mercury said it was in discussions with its lenders to satisfy its working capital needs, but could not predict the outcome of the discussions. The company also said it had retained the services of Salomon Brothers Inc. to advise on its current and future capital needs, as well as all related issues. Mercury said Wednesday it had to restate its earnings for the past four years by a total of about $90 million lower because of accounting irregularities. Mercury said the problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its controller, James Doyle. But Doyle's lawyer reportedly accused Mercury of a charade and said Doyle was cooperating with federal authorities. A special committee of Mercury's board, formed to investigate the accounting problems, has instructed its lawyers to contact Doyle's attorney, to attempt to reach Doyle and to obtain information on the investigation, Mercury said Friday. Doyle's lawyer was out of town Friday and did not return repeated phone calls. The company said it also directed its lawyers and accounting firm to expeditiously complete a thorough investigation of the auditing, accounting practices and procedures of the company and report to the board. Another class-action lawsuit accusing the company of violating securities laws by issuing misleading and false financial statements was filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago.

"A broad coalition of corporations went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to lobby in favor of relaxed export restrictions on computer encoding technology. On Thursday, the Senate Commerce Committee will mark-up the Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996 known as Pro-CODE, a bill that would abolish most export restrictions. Under a Cold War-era munitions statute, only weak encryption programs created in the United States can be sold abroad, although domestic use of encryption is not regulated. Companies in the high-tech industry argued they are losing business to foreign competitors who are not bound by U.S. export restrictions. And multinational companies in other industries said the the restrictions hamper their ability to conduct business overseas. ""We are at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis our foreign competitors and that is an unacceptable situation,"" Gregory Garcia, director of international trade affairs for the American Electronics Association, said at a press briefing here. The Pro-Code bill, sponsored by Republican Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Democratic Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont and others, has bipartisan support in the Commerce Committee. ""We support the Burns bill because it does enable companies to utilize encryption technology securely which is vital if we're going to compete in a very tough global marketplace,"" Victor Parra, president of the Electronic Messaging Association, said. The association represents companies that rely on electronic communications, including Exxon Corp, Citicorp and Boeing Co, Parra said. Encryption programs use mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key."" Earlier this week, Senator James Exon, the Nebraska Democrat, came out against the current bill in a letter to Commerce Committee chairman Sen Larry Pressler. Exon will likely offer amendments at the mark-up, an aide to the senator said. The Clinton administration opposes the Pro-CODE bill, arguing that export of encryption technology would hamper law enforcement and intelligence gathering operatiobns.

"Rains spread inland from coastal Ivory Coast cocoa areas this week after February drought which has threatened to stress trees and reduce late mid-crop (April-Sept) potential, weather and crop analysts said. Industry sources say the mid-crop is likely to determine whether the 1996/97 season harvest is in line with government projections of 950,000 tonnes or close to 1.1 million tonnes -- as some industry players predict. ""The trees are still holding up but heavier rains will be needed in early March to ensure mid-crop prospects,"" one said. ""There are plenty of flower pinheads (buds) on trees but rains are needed to prompt pollinating activity by insects."" Flowers would give pods maturing in August and September. Weather data show little rainfall up to February 20 but another crop analyst returning to Abidjan along the coast this week drove for four hours through heavy rain showers. The first heavy rains for three weeks fell as a thunderstorm over Abidjan on Thursday, following the appearance of clouds over the past 10 days. ""Heavy showers have fallen in the past few days in coastal areas but northern Ivory Coast is still experiencing dry Harmattan weather conditions,"" said a national weather station spokesman. Ivory Coast produced a record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 crop after a bumper 200,000 tonnes mid-crop. Some industry forecasters raised 1996/97 crop forecasts after strong main crop arrivals. Mid-crop prospects are expected to be clearer by mid-March. Upcountry buyers said rains had also fallen inland as far as Gagnoa. New grass could be seen growing through fire-cleared verges on remote roads suggesting rains in those areas. Buyers north of Gagnoa said dry dusty condions had not yet cleared. Crop analysts said a build-up of dust on leaves cutting photosynthesis would only be washed off if rain continued to fall. ""If early March rains are good, trees will react well. There is no sign they have suffered any more than normal,"" one said. ""It is the dry season after all,"" he added. Official weather data for the second 10 days in February showed a total of 13.1 millimetres were recorded at 10 weather stations compared to 0.6 mm in the previous 10 days. Rains were concentrated in coastal regions east of Abidjan with little falling in the commercial capital itself. Data for the past week were not immediately available. In the first and second 10 days of February in 1996 rainfall totalled 303 mm and 361 mm. Weather analysts said this year's totals were 21 percent of the long-term average after higher than normal January levels. Rains have traditionally increased from little rainfall in January towards the main rainy season from April to June followed by a dry spell in July and August. Deforestation has meant convection rainfall patterns are more uneven than in the past with more usually falling in areas with stands of trees left intact -- mostly western areas where new cocoa tree planting is concentrated. Temperatures in cocoa growing countries usually range between a minimum of 18-21 Celsius and a maximum of 30-32C. Temperatures in some Ivory Coast areas have touched 37C in February. Soil moisture levels had partly compensated for the heat after heavy December and light January showers, said crop analysts. The data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall for the second 10 days of February in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan: Dalao 0 mm, Gagnoa 0 mm, San Pedro 0.1 mm, Tabou 0 mm and Man 0 mm, Dimbokro 0, Yamoussoukro 0 mm, Abidjan 2.7 mm, Sassandra 0 mm, Adiake 10.3 mm, Korhogo 0 mm. -- Abidjan Newsroom + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"Chinese lawmakers on Friday called for the ruling Communist Party to tighten control over the nation's armed forces, saying new defence legislation was essential to bring law to the military. Members of the standing committee of the National People's Congress had agreed to submit a draft defence law for approval by a full parliamentary session, the Xinhua news agency said. ""It must be made clear in the law that absolute party leadership over the military must be strengthened,' to ensure a correct political path for the People's Liberation Army (PLA),"" the official agency quoted leading committee members as saying. The three-million-strong PLA has for decades been considered the ""gun"" of the Communist Party (CCP), but analysts say leaders are keen to buttress their control in the face of concerns over the army's loyalty and its growing financial independence. Beijing has tried to rein in the PLA's vast business empire and to strengthen the network of communist cadres charged with overseeing political education and policy among military ranks. The 13-chapter defence law, which began to be drafted in September 1993, has reportedly been long delayed by high-level disagreement over the extent to which it should formalise the Party's leadership role. The law is also expected formally to empower the military to crush rebellions and struggles for regional independence -- roles the army has already shouldered in the past. ""Most lawmakers expressed the view that formulation of the national defence law is crucial for the rule of law in the military field,"" Xinhua said. Foreign analysts of the Chinese military say some army loyalties have been weakened by conflicting institutional interests, business activities and growing corruption. Efforts to boost military loyalty by current party leaders -- few of whom enjoy the military credibility of their revolutionary forebears -- had been unrelenting since 1989, wrote analyst and scholar David Shambaugh earlier this year. ""No doubt the Party's efforts to ensure control over and gain the 'absolute loyalty' of the armed forces arise not only from the CCP leadership's own insecurities but also from the military's growing autonomy,"" Shambaugh wrote. Concerns over the influence of the military's business activities were echoed by legislators reviewing the draft law. The PLA should be banned from business for profit and military expenditure should be guaranteed by the government to make the armed forces concentrate on protecting state security, Xinhua quoted lawmaker Huang Yuzhang as saying. Huang had also called for a commitment by China not to threaten the security of other nations to be added to the law to illustrate Beijing's policy of ""active defence"", it said. Concerns that growing military power could herald future expansionism have risen among China's regional neighbours in recent years, as Beijing has moved to upgrade military technology and boost its power at sea and in the air. China, which has in past decades fought fierce wars across several of its borders, says such fears are entirely unfounded. The state should provide sufficient funds for the research and development of military technology and for more technicians to translate progress into combat power, Xinhua quoted PLA parliamentary deputy Cheng Shouliang as saying on Friday.

"The possibility that landing fees at Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok (CLK) airport could be the highest in the world are a matter of concern for the International Air Transport Association (IATA), its director general Pierre Jeanniot said on Tuesday. He told Reuters that he hoped the increases in fees over those at the existing Kai Tak airport would be reasonable and would ""consider the economic impact on both airlines and Hong Kong"". Jeanniot was speaking following a speech to the Hong Kong International Aerospace Forum which included key representatives from the territory's Airport Authority. Last week, Hong Kong IATA representative Gilbert Chow said new research showed that fees at CLK, which is due to open in April 1998, could be up to four times higher than at Kai Tak. If confirmed this would bring landing fees to around US$12,000 for a Boeing 747, industry sources said. The research was based on revenue forecasts and the expected numbers of flights in and out of CLK, extracted from the business plan suuplied to IATA by the Airport Authority, Chow added. The Authority has repeatedly said charges for landing and aircraft parking will not be announced until next year after full consultations with the airlines. ""They may be higher than existing charges but it is premature to speculate on their level. The Authority is committed to completing and operating a cost-effective airport according to prudent commercial principles,"" an airport statement said. Later on Tuesday, IATA's director of corporate communications, William Gaillard, who was accompanying Jeanniot, said Hong Kong could become the most expensive airport in the world and a quadrupling of fees was ""obviously crazy."" ""We appeal to the Authority to be reasonable when they come to setting the new fees. The damage that could be done is tremendous. We realise there may be an increase but it should be gradual and by a small amount,"" Gaillard told Reuters. Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department said current landing fees for a Boeing 747 are about US$3,000. IATA said the most expensive landing fee is currently US$9,000 at Japan's Kansai airport. Hong Kong IATA representative Gilbert Chow, who is also station manager for Northwest Airlines, said he would like to be proved wrong by the authority. A meeting due to be held this week with authority executives has been postponed. The next meeting is due to be held in February, Chow said. ""This is a major concern to us and we are making the appeal -- don't hit us from day one. The airline business is very competitive but on the other hand it brings a lot of economic benefit to the entire territory. If the increase is so dramatic, then airlines will not be able to cope and the increase wil have to be passed onto the consumer,"" Chow told Reuters. Industry sources said the Airport Authority, under pressure to recoup massive construction costs, is also under increasing pressure from a growing lobby of airlines which see future profit margins under threat from higher fees. There have already been previous warnings about fees doubling which have alarmed airline groups including the Orient Airlines Association. One of the main users of the new airport, Cathay Pacific Airways Limited also recently voiced its alarm and warned that Hong Kong's economy risked being damaged if airport fees were set too high. - Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"Under pressure from President Bill Clinton to quit pitching hard liquor on the airwaves, the nation's distillers urged the president on Friday to gather the beer, wine and spirits industries together to develop a common advertising code. But the White House showed little enthusiasm and the wine and beer industries rejected the move, scoffing at the suggestion that their products were similar to hard liquor. ""Common usage tells us all drinks are not the same,"" the Wine Institute said in a statement. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), in a letter to Clinton, urged the president to use his ""bully pulpit"" and bring the industries -- along with broadcasters -- ""to the table"" to develop and adopt within 90 days a common code for alcohol ads. The initiative came after Clinton asked the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday to study ways to prevent the hard liquor industry from selling its products over television and radio. The hard-liquor industry last year abandoned a decades-old voluntary ban on such promotions, and Clinton called on the industry's executives to renew their moratorium. ""This code would set the same responsible standard for all beverage alcohol advertising and would provide uniform guidelines for the broadcasters,"" DISCUS President Fred Meister told a news conference, without going into specifics. ""This common code would send a strong message that alcohol is alcohol is alcohol,"" he said. DISCUS contended it was unfair to draw a distinction between advertising for hard liquor and for beer and wine, whose ads were not covered by the voluntary ban and have run on television and radio for decades. The industry's voluntary ban has been in effect for TV ads since 1948 and radio ads since 1936. Responding to the liquor industry's proposal, a White House spokesman said: ""What the president is trying to do is prevent backsliding"" on the part of liquor companies. Meister declined to discuss details of what his industry would seek in a common code, saying he did not want to ""preempt the process."" But beer and wine industry officials signalled they would have no part of such a process. ""There are obvious, significant differences between beer and hard liquor. For these reasons an advertising code covering both types of products is neither practical nor workable,"" the Beer Institute said in a statement. A spokeswoman for the National Association of Broadcasters said: ""We haven't seen any details on what they're asking for. ""Until we have a chance to see what exactly they're asking for and what's involved, we can't really respond."" ","RogerFillion"
"British Steel saw its share price skid to a 12-month low on Thursday after a rash of profit downgrades from analysts who said the pound's surge against the mark could slash group profitability. British Steel told Reuters that the pound's advance against the mark was ""a concern"" and reiterated that it was carrying out a cost-cutting review which could see some jobs being axed as a result of the currency factor. Analysts at Natwest Markets cut their profit forecast for the current year and joined Merrill Lynch and SocGen in halving profit predictions for the year after, ending March 1998. All three blamed sterling's relentless rise against the mark and said that not only were exports to Europe in danger, but imports to Britain were also on the up as customers chose the cheaper option. One analyst said ""I think the pound will stay around the 2.60 Deutschemark level. The mark-based steel market is a big European market and the current exchange rate makes British Steel look expensive not just abroad but at home as well. ""British Steel is being hit on both fronts."" The British group's shares are currently trading at 151- 1/2 pence per share, down two and a half pence on the day. The shares have not been this low since January 1996 and have retreated from a high of 201-1/2. Merrill analyst Paul Compton said the pretax profit downgrade on Wednesday to 280 million pounds from 650 million for the year to March 1998 was purely due to the potential impact of the UK currency. ""British Steel was probably using 2.30 (marks) to the pound for 1996/97,"" said Compton. ""In 1997/98 it now looks like they will have to raise it to as much as 2.65 marks and the impact is around 350 million (on profits)."" Sterling is currently trading around the highest levels seen since it exited the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in late 1992. When Merrill made its forecast downgrade on Wednesday, the currency was trading at around 2.65 marks to the pound and $1.69. SocGen analyst Andy Chambers told Reuters he had cut the British Steel pretax profit figures for the year to March 1998 to 400 million pounds from 700 million. Industry sources said Natwest Markets had gone further by slashing the current year pretax profit forecast to March 1997 to 477 million pounds from 611 million. Natwest has cut its forecast for the following year to 355 million from 449. All analysts reported that British Steel would be hit in European export markets which are mark/pound sensitive and that as the pound gains ground, the domestic market has also become vulnerable with customers buying cheaper imports. Of British Steel's eight billion pounds in sales, the company said 50 percent is exported. A spokesman for the steel giant said that up to three billion pounds of its total sales are sensitive to the pound/mark exchange rate. ","EdnaFernandes"
"Vodafone Group, Britain's biggest mobile telephone group, raised headline annual profits by 13.5 percent on Tuesday and said it was plotting to overhaul its distribution strategy to kick-start sluggish market growth. Vodafone, which boasts more than four million customers worldwide, lifted pre-tax profits to 539 million pounds ($880.8 million) -- the top-end of analyst expectations -- including gains from disposals. Turnover grew 25 percent to 1.749 billion pounds and dividends rose 20 percent to 4.81p. A maiden operating profit from its international operations of 10.5 million pounds helped boost profits and analysts expect overseas investments to take up the reins of future group earnings amid increasing competition and price cuts at home. Vodafone's chief executive Chris Gent told Reuters in an interview that subscriber growth in Britian was likely to continue to slow this year -- and Vodafone might cut tariffs next year to help attract new customers. Vodafone last reduced tariffs around two years ago. But since then, its biggest purely digital rival -- Orange Plc -- has rolled out its network and the smallest operator in Britain, One 2 One, will also soon have a national network. ""I can see it (price cuts) happening again in the summer or autumn of 1998,"" Gent said. Vodafone also plans to unveil new distribution plans next month, including rationalising its 12 brands under one or two names and introducing a unified billing system to help win fresh subscribers, Gent told Reuters. One 2 One, jointly owned by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc and U S West Inc, highlighted cut-throat competition in the market by repackaging tariffs last month -- and prompted concerns that Britain is ripe for a rash of price cuts. Mobile telephone penetration is currently stuck around 13 percent in Britain, compared to around five percent in France, 7.5 percent in Germany and the Netherlands -- and a hefty 29 percent in Sweden. Gent, who is hoping that British penetration will rise to 15 percent next year, expects the group to win only 350,000 to 400,000 net new subscribers this year, a touch lower than last year's 415,000 level. ""I suspect this year will be similar to last year -- perhaps a little bit down but not much,"" he said, adding: ""I believe we'll see accelerated growth in the UK once we get beyond 15 percent penetration."" Last year already saw subscriber growth levels fall  34 percent from 1995/96 levels. Analysts note that Finland, which has almost three times the British penetration levels, is growing faster in a quarter than Britain did in the whole of last year. But broker SBC Warburg adds: ""In our view, renewed growth is a question of 'when' rather than 'if'."" Gent puts down unenthusiastic growth to fewer incentives to win customers and a high level of churn -- when subscribers end contracts -- while customers migrate from its older analogue network to its digital services. Vodafone has around 1.3 million customers on its analogue network and some 1.6 million digital subscribers. The company saw its market share slip 1.5 percent to 40 percent and the key average revenue per subscriber figure -- the amount of profit the company makes on each of its customers -- fell to 427 pounds from 481 pounds. Vodafone is now growing faster internationally than in Britain and Gent expects 650,000 new customers to take up its international affiliates' services this year. Brokers Lehman Brothers expects overseas interests to contribute 279 million pounds by 1999/2000 -- and analysts expect Vodafone's shares, trading unchanged at 271.5p on Tuesday -- to start reflecting this value over the next nine months. Although Vodafone said it was not actively seeking new licences, it will consider acquisition opportunities. The company said it was ""very likely"" to exercise its option to raise its holding in SFR, France's second network operator, to 20 percent this year. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds) ","KirstinRidley"
"The ""Great Leap East"" in Shanghai real estate has begun, with the property market in the Pudong zone beginning to look up, thanks to official pressure on foreign banks to move over there, property analysts said. But the overall outlook for Shanghai's office property market remains grim from the developer's point of view -- vacancy rates are around 30 percent and likely to rise to 60 percent by the end of 1997 due to a forest of new buildings, the analysts said. Pudong's Lujiazui district has been designated by the Chinese authorities as the future ""Wall Street of Asia"". But the office space glut and transport difficulties have kept people away, until now. ""The great leap east is in progress,"" said Sam Crispin, senior manager with real estate firm First Pacific Davies in Shanghai. ""There's been a rapid shift in interest with the banks moving over there. The service sector will then follow,"" he said. Leading the leap to Pudong are the foreign banks which have been bluntly told by the Shanghai city government that they will not be able to do local currency business unless they put their headquarters in Pudong. Eight foreign banks have been given approval to do local yuan business in the past month, and they are busy setting up their Pudong operations, while other foreign banks with full branches in Shanghai are lobbying hard to gain the same privilege. Crispin said Lujiazui's office vacancy rate was probably around 75 percent at present, and would probably remain at that figure for the rest of the year. ""I don't see any significant decline by the end of this year because there's significant amounts of stock coming onto the market,"" he said. James Hawkey, research manager for Jones Lang Wootton in Shanghai, said that while vacancy rates in Pudong were high, the take-up rate was accelerating. ""The vacancy rate (in Pudong) is currently 69.7 percent, but that's to be expected for a newly-developed area,"" he said. ""There's a lot of new supply in 1997, but vacancy rates will probably start to move down,"" he said. With supply far in excess of demand for the foreseeable future, the analysts said they saw Shanghai real estate prices overall sliding further. The foreign banks are paying $20-24 per square metre per month for prime Pudong office space, compared to rates double that or more on the other side of the river in central Shanghai, analysts said. ""Rates (in central Shanghai) are likely to slide over the next couple of years. They may come down to about $30, but what the market is seeing now is that companies that want quality space are willing to pay for it,"" said First Pacific Davies's Crispin. Another real estate broker said he saw the price floor for quality office space in Shanghai at somewhere close to $10-15 per square metre per month. ""The bottom of the pit is the limit, there's too many buildings,"" the broker said. ""But there's still a shortage of really good properties."" A Chinese real estate broker said grade A real estate in Pudong was already renting for around $15 per square metre per month. ""The overall occupancy rate is about 30-40 percent, although some of the better buildings are over 50 percent. But it will be three to five years before Pudong property is really fully absorbed,"" the broker said. ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"Michael Grade, who shocked the British media world this week when he announced he was quitting Channel 4 television, said on Wednesday he was to head First Leisure Plc. Grade is to become executive chairman of the company by July 31. Current chief executive John Conlan plans to leave the business by the end of the year. Founded in 1982 by Grade's uncle, Lord Delfont, First Leisure operates a range of leisure business from bowling alleys and bars to the Blackpool Tower tourist site. ""I think I have a feel for what entertains the British public,"" said Grade when asked about his new role at a company where he is already non-executive chairman. Grade, 53, announced on Monday that he was quitting as chief executive of the Channel 4 commercial televison network after almost a decade in the job. Grade, who comes from a leading British showbusiness family, won plaudits at Channel 4 for building the station's audience share to more than 10 percent while maintaining its reputation for distinctive programming. ""The fear I had was that I would get stale,"" said Grade, commenting on his decision to leave the world of television. Grade said he wanted to ""quit while he was ahead"" at Channel 4, having apparently seen off attempts to privatise the station and won the battle to end a system of payments to the ITV commercial television companies. His move is certain to ensure a higher profile for First Leisure, a company with a market capitalisation of only around 600 million pounds. The company had pre-tax profit of 43.7 million pounds ($71 million) in the year to end-October on turnover of 183 million. First Leisure shares added 18.5p to 359.5p on Wednesday as the market welcomed news of Grade's appointment. But Grade said ""continuity not change"" would be his motto. ""Anyone who is expecting radical change will be disappointed,"" he said. ""We have a major development programme ongoing. That is where the growth of the company is coming from. That is the strategy."" First Leisure is spending 55 million pounds this year alone on new bars, nightclubs and fitness centres, part of an investment programme worth a total of 100 million pounds. Channel Four has helped to produce hit British movies such as Four Weddings And A Funeral and Trainspotting in recent years and there had been speculation that Grade might seek to take First Leisure into the movie business. However, Grade denied press speculation that the company planned to bid for Britain's Rank Film Distributors. Grade, who was on an annual salary of around 450,000 pounds at Channel Four, would not be drawn on how much he would earn at First Leisure. Conlan, who denied he had been forced out of the company, was paid some 400,000 pounds in 1995. ($1=.6175 Pound) ","KeithWeir"
"The Prague Stock Exchange, as expected, backed off last week's year-high on a round of profit taking on Monday, but analysts said market sentiment remains bullish for the coming weeks. After a strong rise last week, market heavyweights SPT Telecom, CEZ and Komercni Banka, which combined account for over one-half of the PX50 index, all fell sharply to drag the index down 0.28 percent to 598.0. ""The market has corrected a little bit, but there seems to be good support at this level,"" Marco Anderegg of Patria Finance told Reuters. ""Foreign investor interest remains solid and towards the end of last week broader issues were gaining interest so it looks solid for a lot of the market,"" he added. SPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, closed down 75 crowns at 3,700, while CEZ, which accounts for 14 percent, was off 28 crowns to 1,202 and Komercni, with market cap of 11 percent, lost 25 crowns to 2,620. ""We saw some of the blue chips such as Komercni and SPT rebound in late deals, which could show that the market's weakness will be short-lived. I expect to see prices begin rising again soon,"" said one local trader. The PSE has since a steady uptrend in 1997 after a fourth quarter 1996 slump took 25 percent off the index after a lack of commitment on the part of government officials to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency undermined the market. The index has gained 9.7 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors. Bram Buring of Brno Broker Group said the correction could last for several weeks as lower-than-expected company results begin to flood in, possibly taking as much as five percent from the index before it rebounds. But, he added: ""Foreign investors are definitely interested and kicking starting the market...and we expect that to continue on but things have overheated a little at the moment."" Analysts added that the recent strong performance of the crown should also boost the equities market since investors are shielded from wide currency fluctuations. The crown has gained over three percent against its dollar/mark basket since the beginning of the year, and analysts have predicted it will hold its value or strengthen further in the coming weeks. In late afternoon trading on Monday it was holding steady at 5.32 percent above its basket mid-point, up slightly from the central bank's daily fixing at +5.28 percent. The crown was fixed on Friday at 5.23 percent. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","AlanCrosby"
"Canada's top securities regulator said on Thursday it is probing whether Bre-X Minerals Ltd, mired in controversy over its Busang gold find in Indonesia, breached insider trading and disclosure laws. The Ontario Securities Commisson said the Calgary-based gold prospector has been under investigation since the end of 1996. But it did not reveal details of the probe until today. ""The OSC can confirm that the investigation relates to whether there has been a breach of continuous disclosure requirements or insider trading provisions,"" the regulator said in a statement. The OSC said it has not determined whether there is enough information to begin formal proceedings against Bre-X, but the investigation is focusing on whether there were breaches of Ontario's Securities Act. The regulator's announcement was among several fresh twists in the Bre-X Minerals saga. A group of Canadian Bre-X shareholders launched a class action lawsuit on Thursday, adding to the five court actions the company already faces in the United States. Frantic trading in Bre-X shares handcuffed the Toronto Stock Exchange once again on Thursday -- the third time this week that the TSE has stopped Bre-X due to heavy order volumes and a creaky computer system. A much-anticipated report on Bre-X's assay program at Busang confirmed the company's orginal findings on Thursday. But analysts said the highly technical report by Kilborn SNC Lavalin Inc also raised new questions about the controversial gold project. Bre-X has been under seige since last week when its partner in Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. , revealed that early drilling samples performed during its due diligence process on the Busang gold property in the rain forests of Borneo turned up only tiny amounts of gold. Panic selling lopped nearly C$3 billion off the company's market value last Thursday and the stock has since played havoc with the TSE's old computer trading system. Bre-X climbed C23 cents to C$3.34 on brisk turnover of 5.02 million shares before the Toronto exchange was forced to stop trading at 1243 EST/1743 GMT on Thursday. The TSE again cited ""systems problems caused by high levels of order flow in (the) company's stock."" The trading problems irritated investors and further embarrassed the exchange, which has been the butt of jokes recently on the U.S. financial news television channel CNBC. The stock continued trading on the Nasdaq, Montreal and Alberta exchanges. The TSE said it will resume trading at 0930 EST/1430 GMT on Friday. Kilborn, a unit of engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc performed the original resource calculations on Busang showing it contained an estimated 70.95 million ounces of gold. The firm confirmed its findings on Thursday, based on assay samples provided to it by Bre-X. ""The standard deviation and variance observed in the analysis of the database is consistent with previous test work done on Busang samples...,"" said the report, which was released by the Toronto Stock Exchange and the OSC. Bre-X chief executive officer David Walsh promised on Monday the report would shed light on Bre-X's testing methods. But Bre-X told the TSE and OSC on Thursday that the report contained no new material information. ""Our view is investors should have as much information available to make their own decisions. We thought it should be out there,"" OSC chairman Jack Geller told Reuters. Analysts said the Kilborn report does not resolve the controversy over Busang, but did provide a few details not known before. The hammer mill process used by Bre-X ""can produce a non-reliable sample in the preparation process,"" a mining analyst said. ""If there is a problem here, it is in within the sample preparation. It is not in the assays, it's problem in the sample preparation."" Bre-X has hired an mining consultant, Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd, to conduct an independent drilling program and audit of the Busang site. Strathcona is expected to deliver its report by early May. ""What everyone is waiting for is the actual independent drilling by Strathcona,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.

"Chrysler Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Eaton said Tuesday that the automaker will report record earnings for the full 1996 year, based on record worldwide sales of 2.97 million vehicles. ""We're going to have a record year,"" Eaton told Reuters in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show.   Chrysler's previous annual profit record came in 1994, when the company earned $3.713 billion. It earned $2.025 billion in 1995, when sales were held to 2.61 million units by the launch of its current line of minivans. Eaton also said Chrysler in 1997 should be able to exceed its 1996 sales results because the company will be able to produce about 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than it built in 1996.   The increase will be made up of added capacity for the new Dodge Durango sport/utility vehicle in Newark, Del., as well as increased line speeds for the Dodge Ram pickup truck in St. Louis, and increased production of Dodge Dakota pickup trucks in Warren, Mich. Chrysler plans to unveil the Durango at the Detroit auto show later Tuesday.   In other capacity moves, Eaton also said Chrysler has tentatively planned to add a third production shift to its Bramalea, Ontario, car assembly plant after it launches production of a new generation of LH family sedans later this year. The LH line includes the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and LHS and Eagle Vision, which also are expected to be introduced at the show. Eaton said despite sluggish industry car sales the increasing popularity and profitability of light truck models, the automaker has not cut back on investment in future car programs.   However, he said Chrysler may shift its investment plans if trucks continue to gain market share. ""We're going to put the money where the market goes,"" he said, adding that new, more efficient truck engines should allow Chrysler to continue to increase truck capacity without violating federal fuel economy laws.   Eaton said he is pleased with the financial stability that Chrysler has acheived in recent years, but it still needs to continue to prove itself to Wall Street to earn a higher stock price and raise its price-to-earnings ratio above the current level of 7.3 percent. Chrysler shares were trading down 1/4 at 35-3/8. He reiterated that Chrysler can earn still earn a profit even if U.S. automotive industry sales fall by 20 percent. ","DavidLawder"
"The Asia-Pacific region should work towards lowering telephone charges to stimulate usage and promote economic growth, Australian Telecommunications Minister Richard Alston said on Thursday. ""An important emphasis of our work must be to ensure that users benefit from progress being made in telecommunications,"" Alston told the second Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) telecommunications ministers meeting. ""At the most basic level this means providing access to people who have lacked it, by extending the reach of networks and by lowering prices to ensure that genuine access is available to all our people,"" Alston said. ""Our experience is that real cost reductions are possible, but they are less likely to be achieved under monopoly arrangements,"" he said. Alston cited Australia's example. In June, privately owned telecommunications and pay television group Optus Vision started to offer local telephone calls at 20 cents per call, which was 25 percent cheaper than that charged by state-owned Telstra.

"Strippers can dance naked in Canada as long as they keep their distance from the customers. Exotic dancers on Thursday cheered a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that bans lap dancing, but club owners warned it would turn off customers and put some establishments out of business. ""I think it's great. Dancing is for seeing, not touching,"" said a dancer at Filmores, a well-known Toronto strip club. Canada's top court ruled on Wednesday that lap dancing -- sitting naked on a customer's lap and rubbing against him -- was indecent and a criminal act. Andy, a lunchtime patron at the Zanzibar strip club on Toronto's seedy Yonge Street, said the court ban was unnecessary. ""The only thing criminal about it is if prostitution is involved. Some girls just take it too far,"" said the apprentice electrician as a dancer gyrated on the stage behind him. Canada's lap-dance brouhaha began in 1994 when an Ontario judge ruled that a variety of sexual acts at a Toronto strip club did not offend community standards. After the ruling, lap dancing quickly spread to other clubs across the country. A former stripper, Katharine Goldberg, led a public crusade against lap dancing, arguing that some dancers were forced by club owners to masturbate customers and perform other acts. ""This should end the suffering of so many young women and protect the health and lives of many people,"" Goldberg said. But Canadian newspapers have quoted other strippers who resented Goldberg's potrayal of them as sex slaves. Most customers obeyed the no-touch rule and it was more lucrative than table dancing, they said. A lap dance can cost up to $20 each with some dancers taking home between $300 and $500 a night. The Supreme Court upheld an appeal court decision that overturned the original 1994 court ruling. The appeals judge said lap dancing degraded dancers and encouraged clients to treat women as sexual objects. ","DarrenSchuettler"

"Lawyers acting for Peter Young, the fund manager suspended last week by Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), said on Monday there were no grounds for allegations of criminality and there had been no such allegation in the proceedings which had been served on him. ""There is no allegation of criminality in the proceedings which have been served on Peter Young and there would be no grounds whatsoever for any such allegation,"" solicitors Peters &amp; Peters said in a statement.   Young was suspended when MGAM, a subsidiary of German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG, said it had found ""suspected irregularities"" in three of its funds, two of which were managed by him. Young, whose personal assets were frozen after MGAM and fund trustee Royal Bank of Scotland obtained an injunction, has not been available for comment. Trading in the funds was halted last Monday but resumed on Thursday after a 180 million pounds ($280.7 million) cash injection by Deutsche Bank and reassurances that investors would not lose out.   The problems centre on the valuation of the high proportion of unlisted high-technology stocks held in the funds. They are being investigated by British investments watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO). Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which prosecutes major financial crimes has taken no official action. It has been in contact with IMRO, but has so far only been kept briefed on developments and denies a criminal investigation is underway.   ""Weekend reports that the SFO was about to get involved were wholly speculative. The director must have reasonable grounds to suspect that serious or complex fraud offences have taken place,"" SFO spokesman James O'Donoghue told Reuters on Monday. The probe into what took place within MGAM is widely expected to take some time, with a complex web of holdings and companies around the world to be unravelled. Both MGAM and IMRO have drafted in forensic accountants to look into the fund management business of the three funds, MGAM has enlisted Ernst &amp; Young and IMRO Deloitte Touche.   MGAM has also appointed law firm Slaughter &amp; May to help untangle a labyrinth of investments. Slaughter &amp; May confirmed its appointment but would not comment on the investigation. The fall-out of the episode for Deutsche Bank continued on Monday with the news from credit rating agency Moody's that it is looking at the bank's rare and treasured triple-A credit rating in the light of the MGAM situation. And investment bank Salomon Brothers said the worry that Deutsche Bank might return to its accident prone image of the early 1990s may be the most serious concern stemming from problems at the bank's asset management arm.   But Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the bank's investment banking arm, said redemptions from the funds had dropped by over half on Monday compared to the 83 million pounds redeemed last Friday and the 110 million pounds which flooded out last Thursday. ""Just under 39 million pounds was redeemed today,"" DMG spokesman James Murray told Reuters. ""As expected the redemptions have slowed down significantly. There is still enough cash left in the funds."" ""What we are seeing is a stabilisation,"" he added.   He said there had been just over 300 million pounds in the funds after the Deutshe cash injection and if redemptions continued to drop there would be sufficient cash. Murray confirmed that investors would be compensated, but that the amount would only be decided after the investigation. ""If compensation is found to be due then it will be paid by us,"" he said, adding that it would be calculated by an independent accountant appointed by IMRO. He said the preliminary part of MGAM's investigation would take between four and six weeks. ($1=.6412 Pound) ","AlexanderSmith"
"Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that the Czech National Bank may have gone too far in its attempts to slow inflation quickly and the result may have been a slowing in economic growth. Speaking at Prague's Zofin Forum of business leaders Klaus said there was no way to slow inflation quickly, and that central bank steps last year to rein in consumer prices were more than the government wanted. ""At this moment I see in the Czech economy the existence of an array of short-term irremovable inflation factors which we cannot simply get rid of, and I also do not see any easy way to a faster slowing of inflation,"" said Klaus, a monetarist professor of economics. Klaus took issue with restrictive monetary measures of the Czech National Bank last year which helped cut inflation to 7.3 percent year-on-year in February from levels above nine percent in the previous year. He said that the government differed with the central bank on whether monetary tightening measures to slow inflation would slow the economy. ""I believe that in our context and in our structural parameters disinflation bought at the high price of a marked loss in the pace of economic growth was more than we would have wished,"" he added. Still, Klaus told his audience that February's inflation rate was ""satisfactory"". He said that 1996 full-year gross domestic product growth ended one percent lower than the government originally expected. He did not give a specific result. The government's original forecast was growth of 4.8 percent. Full-year official GDP results are expected later this month. Klaus said factors in this slowing of growth were weak demand for exports because of weak growth and protected markets in western Europe. Another reason was the ""unfavourable structure of our domestic demand -- consumer as well as investment."" Klaus however stressed the ""restrictive measures of the central bank"" and its role on demand as a factor and said the CNB ""used"" the chaos after inconclusive June elections to raise interest rates and tighten minimum reserve requirements. He said the main problem facing the country's economy was a widening trade deficit, but he ruled out a devaluation of the crown to help the situation. ""I am only reminding you that the cure for our trade deficit cannot be any devaluation of the crown and fortunately the government, the central bank and the majority of analysts agree with this,"" Klaus said. The Czech trade deficit, spurred by imports of raw materials and machinery needed for industrial restructuring, widened to a record 160.3 billion crowns for the whole of 1996, up from 95.7 billion the previous year. The deficit is forecast to grow even further in 1997, to around 210-220 billion crowns. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003 ","JohnMastrini"
"A leader of the crushed 1989 democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square predicted on Thursday there would be no similar crackdowns in China or Hong Kong under Chinese rule, but there would be pressure to conform. Han Dongfang, a former railwayman who formed a free trade union in the 1989 student-led democracy movement, said China's leaders had learned lessons from ""this historical misunderstanding"" and would not use the army this way again. In June eight years ago China's communist rulers sent the People's Liberation Army into Beijing and ruthlessly put down the movement with heavy loss of life. In Tiananmen Square, the hub of the protests, it was as though hungry children were tempted by a green unripe apple of democracy, the 34-year-old dissident, now living in exile in British-ruled Hong Kong, said in an interview. ""They reached up and ate it, and suddenly they realised it tasted very bad,"" Han said. ""You cannot blame those hungry children, and you cannot blame the apple for being so green. So June 4, 1989, was a big historical misunderstanding,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody can use tanks and machineguns again to crack down on a social movement."" China's next social upheaval, if it happened, was likely to involve workers and farmers complaining they had no food or money. ""Do you think machineguns and tanks can crack down on such hungry, angry people if they are going to die of hunger anyway?"" Many of Hong Kong's 6.4 million people have been worried that China will break its hands-off promise and introduce repressive rule in the territory. Beijing has already unveiled plans to repeal some Hong Kong legislation protecting civil rights when Britain hands the colony back on July 1 -- ordinances it has said violated the territory's future China-designed constitution. China also plans to dissolve the elected legislature, saying the council was elected under reforms enacted over its objections. Han said that after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month, President Jiang Zemin's ruling group was too busy with internal problems to crack down on Hong Kong. ""They face very, very big problems in the villages, unemployment in big state enterprises, which are to be reformed, and in the ethnic minority areas,"" Han said. Han said Hong Kong was a goldmine for China. ""Chinese leaders will only break the golden egg if Hong Kong becomes a very big danger to their power. I don't think that will happen,"" Han said, speaking a day after Hong Kong announced record fiscal reserves of HK$330 billion (US$42.3 billion). Beijing has promised the territory will retain a high degree of autonomy and its capitalist system for 50 years. Han spent two years in jail for ""counter-revolutionary acts"" after Tiananmen, and was then released and allowed to go to the United States for medical treatment. When he tried to return to China in 1993, his passport was cancelled, forcing him into exile in Hong Kong. Asked if he thought China would crush the Hong Kong democracy movement after the sovereignty change, Han said Beijing would be more subtle than in 1989. He said China would try to influence Hong Kong through prods and whispers to its new legislators and leaders -- all of whom have been screened by Beijing before the handover -- and that the business community would support curbs on democracy. ""The Chinese leaders have gained a lot of experience since 1989 inside China. They welcome businessmen and tell them they will have better conditions for their business than before, in a society with no social movements, no trouble for business."" Han said he trusted Hong Kong's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, who was selected by a Beijing-backed committee. ""He is not a bad person. I don't think he'll send protesters to jail. He's not going to wear the same trousers as the Chinese government."" (US$1=HK$7.8) ","PeterHumphrey"
"TNT Express Worldwide is to double the number of staff it employs in China and open five new branches within the next year, general manager for Hong Kong Bryan Chan told Reuters. The express freight firm said it has also applied for full landing rights at Shanghai and Xiamen to extend its dedicated Asian Air Express freighter service. TNT uses two British Aerospace 146 and a Boeing 727 freighter in an overnight delivery service between Manila, Hong Kong, Singapore, Jakarta, Taipei and Seoul. Industry observers point out that it took TNT five years to gain rights for the six existing destinations, so permission for the Chinese destinations is expected to be a slow process. ""We realise it may take time but Shanghai is a very good point to connect to the Philippines and gives us more options to eventually allow us to close the loop in our Asian network,"" Chan said in an interview. He said a main task for Eric Wong, newly appointed general sales manager for Hong Kong, will be to promote expansion of the air network. TNT currently has nine China branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, Shenzhen, Qingdao, Nnnjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou in a joint venture with the state monopoly Sinotrans Group. TNT plans to open new offices in Xiamen, Shenyang, Xian, Wuhan and Ningbo employing 300 more staff some of whom are due to arrive in Hong Kong this month to begin training, Chan said. TNT currently employs 273 staff in Hong and 300 employees in its China branches, he added. TNT will also be focusing its expansion programme on southern China and the Pearl river delta. ""There is a big need for logistics and value added services in southern China including warehousing, documentation and pick and pack. With the increase in volume we need more staff and more infrastructure. We will try to offer the same 'one stop shop' service as we offer in Hong Kong,"" he added. TNT said it expects its profits in Hong Kong to increase by 43 per cent this year after a 30 per cent increase in revenue along with a 20 per cent increase in China revenue. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 5017 Fax+44 171 542 5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"China's President Jiang Zemin granted a rare meeting to members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday in a campaign aimed at boosting ties with the American Congress. A beaming Jiang was shown on state television receiving the 22 representatives -- the biggest U.S. congressional delegation ever to visit China. ""Improving Sino-U.S. relations and developing them on a healthy basis is in the interests of both countries,"" he said. ""I had very good discussions with President (Bill) Clinton in Manila in November and we reached some important understandings. ""The Chinese side is willing to grasp the present opportunities and, along with the United States, to reduce difficulties between our two countries."" Beijing and Washington have been trying to mend ties that were badly strained by a series of disputes over the past two years ranging from Taiwan to trade and human rights. In Manila, Jiang and Clinton agreed on an exchange of presidential visits in 1997 and 1998 that would be the first since President George Bush came to China in early 1989. Analysts said China's communist leadership -- and Jiang in particular -- were eager to boost ties with the Congress, fearing that Beijing had suffered by relying too heavily on its links to the U.S. administration in the past. They noted that the Beijing believes it was led astray by administration assurances that Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui would not be permitted to visit the United States in 1995. Congress pushed hard for Lee and the landmark private visit was eventually allowed to proceed, a decision that enraged Beijing. China turned its anger on the island, which it considers a rebel province, first breaking off a semi-official channel for talks with Taipei and later holding missile tests near the island in March last year. Jim Kolbe, the Arizona Republican who is leading the congressional delegation, told reporters shortly before his meeting with Jiang on Tuesday that Chinese leaders had recognised the need for contacts with Congress. ""The Chinese are becoming much more skilled and have much more contact"" with Congress, he said. Members of the congressional group told reporters that human rights had come up in discussions with other Chinese officials and would be raised during the meeting with Jiang. Jiang met a U.S. Senate group led by minority leader Tom Daschle last November. Jiang, who is known to be fond of Western pop songs, was said to have entertained that group with some of his repertoire. It was unknown if the Kolbe delegation would be treated to the same welcome.

"Europe's envoy in Hong Kong on Thursday said the European Union had lost credibility by falling into public disarray over a resolution at the United Nations designed to censure China for human rights violations. ""We are now not as credible an interlocutor matching the commercial clout we have because we are not united,"" Etienne Reuter, head of the European Commission in Hong Kong, said in an interview with Reuters. ""We haven't helped our own image, and we haven't helped the cause of furthering human rights in China... It has certainly weakened our position here,"" the envoy said. The Geneva resolution, sponsored by Denmark and backed by the United States, failed to win EU support when France said that recent human rights improvements by China suggested dialogue was better than confrontation. This is the first year the EU has failed to back the resolution since the 1989 Beijing massacre, when China crushed democracy protesters in a bloody crackdown around Tiananmen Square. ""This means that...when (people in Hong Kong) look for help or support they will tend to look first to North America or maybe even to Japan, rather than believe the Europeans have the cards to play. That is, I think, the sad reality,"" Reuter said. Denmark, the United States and human rights activists condemned the EU's silence, which fell in the year that Hong Kong reverts from British to Chinese rule. The United States is also usually seen as the most outspoken defender of human rights in Hong Kong, but Reuter argued Europe also should have a role to play. Under the ""one country, two systems"" formula, Hong Kong will retain considerable autonomy for 50 years as a Special Administrative Region within China. But as the July 1 handover nears, concern is rising that many key freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people will soon be lost. Moves by future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa to trim civil liberties have provoked condemnation from many sides in Hong Kong and prompted criticism from the United States. Beijing responded by telling the United States to stop meddling in China's internal affairs. The EU's Reuter said he hoped the ""Geneva debacle"" reminded Europe that its future influence in Hong Kong depended upon unity, particularly as the handover approaches. ""The indications for a smooth transition...are good, so I would not like to paint a dark scenario for the future, but I certainly think it is important for the Europeans to realise they can only be effective here if they are united,"" he said. The incident also had drawn attention to Europe's urgent need for a common foreign policy, one geared more to common interests rather than values. ""You will always have realists versus idealists, and people thinking, 'Why should it be our job to be the world's policeman or the world's preacher?' (This) is a discussion which concerns everybody in Europe and not only France,"" he said. An outstanding deal by an Airbus Industrie-led consortium to build a 100-seat plane in a Chinese joint venture had little to do with France's objection, Reuter said. ""I don't think people should think it's only because of a couple of Airbuses that France did not support the concept of the resolution in Geneva,"" he said. French President Jacques Chirac is due to sign the deal during a visit to China in May, although Beijing said recently that more work was needed to finalise the contract and called upon the European side to offer better terms.

"CE Electric claimed 50.03 percent of British target Northern Electric in a fiercely fought bid on Saturday but, in an unusual twist, needs takeover panel approval on crucial extra acceptances to declare victory. A spokesman for the U.S. company said additional acceptances were still being counted. CE Electric held 49.77 percent of the regional electricity company (Rec) by its own 1300 GMT deadline on December 20, just short of control, but in an unprecedented move the British takeover panel stepped in to extend final deadlines.   The panel said late on Friday that the deadline for the 782 million pound ($1.30 billion) contentious offer had been extended to 1300 GMT on Christmas Eve and said any acceptances arriving after CE's Friday deadline must have its consent. No one at the takeover panel was immediately available for comment, nor was Northern Electric. The Financial Times newspaper said on Saturday that the extension of the deadlines suggested the panel felt shareholders had not been treated fairly in the last days of the 650 pence per share bid. CE Electric said in a statement earlier on Saturday that the panel had ""prohibited Northern's advisers from purchasing Northern Electric shares at anytime prior to the close of CE Electric's final offers."" The American energy group had complained to the takeover panel earlier this week over share buying by Northern's advisers, brokers BZW and Schroders, which it claimed was ""frustrating action"". But the panel cleared the purchases, which amounted to 2.32 percent of Northern, late on Thursday. It said in a statement then that at a hearing of the panel BZW and Schroders had ""accepted that there was no doubt about their intention -- it was to defeat the bid. However, they denied that there had been any breach of the code."" The panel said such purchases have ""long been accepted."" The bid, which was raised from an original 630 pence per share offer on December 6, has been hotly contested by Northern, which claims the price undervalues it. Northern had claimed it had the backing of its largest institutional investor, the Prudential, which holds around 11 percent, as well as other funds including M&amp;G and Foreign &amp; Colonial. But prior to Friday's deadline, CE Electric already held 30 percent of Northern, bought on the open market, and had previously declared acceptances which brought its holding up to around 34 percent. Northern is the only one of the original 12 cash-rich Recs to have successfully fought off a takeover bid, spending 560 million pounds on shareholder benefits to fend off Trafalgar House, now part of Norway's Kvaerner, last year. Nine of the 12 Recs have been sold or agreed to takeovers since they came up for grabs when the government's protective golden share expired in March 1995, just five years after privatisation. If CE Electric wins control of Northern, only two of the original 12 Recs will remain independent -- Yorkshire and Southern. Analysts see Yorkshire, which could carry a price tag of around 1.4 billion pounds, as the more vulnerable of the two, as Southern could cost a predator over two billion pounds and has firepower to mount a fierce defence. American companies already own three Recs with two others in agreed takeovers, Dominion Resources with East Midlands and Entergy with London Electricity. U.S. companies are hotly tipped as potential buyers for remaining Recs as they are attracted to the UK's friendly regulatory environment and see the country as a good English-speaking springboard into continental Europe.

"China's financial markets breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday as the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping removed a major element of uncertainty that had overshadowed them for years, analysts said. The single most sensitive and volatile factor for the markets in and around China in recent years had been the health of Deng. Suddenly, it's not there any more. ""The official announcement has finally removed the main disturbing factor in the markets for the past few years,"" said a Hong Kong stock analyst based in Shanghai. ""It's the start of a new era. The new focal point of concern will hopefully be more economic fundamentals,"" the analyst said. Local Chinese brokers agreed that Deng's death late on Wednesday removed a key negative factor from the markets. ""His health has long loomed large on the markets,"" said one stock analyst in Shanghai. Bruce Richardson, Shanghai representative of HG Asia, said traders were relieved the wait was over. ""For years, people have been saying that when he goes there will be a deep drop which will present a buying opportunity. I'm a little surprised that the markets have digested the event so quickly,"" Richardson said. ""It shows that people are taking a forward-looking attitude. sentiment is very positive all around,"" he added. Stock markets in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan moved higher on Thursday after gyrating wildly at the opening after the news. Hong Kong stocks had jumped 1.96 percent or 256.96 points, by midday after an initial loss of 92 points. The weighted index in Taiwan rebounded from an earlier fall to close 21.19 points, or 0.28 percent, higher at 7,678.04. The Shanghai foreign currency B index was up 0.29 percent or 0.188 points at 65.318 while Shenzhen was up 0.63 percent or 0.89 points at 142.64. Some analysts have predicted a power struggle in the wake of Deng's demise while others viewed the current leadership structure headed by Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin as being basically stable. China markets would now be looking for signs to indicate which group of pundits was correct, analysts said. ""The main concern is political instability,"" said a broker in Shenzhen. ""People will be watching to see what measures the government takes over the next few days."" ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"Canada is raising the amount of investment required of prospective immigrants seeking to settle in the country, Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard said on Friday. Under a program designed to attract investment, one way foreigners seeking to live in Canada may be granted an immigrant visa is by pledging to invest in the economy. But Robillard told a news conference the required amount would be raised to avoid abuse and to ensure adequate economic impact. ""While we won't be changing the basic selection criteria for investor entry to Canada, we will be changing the amounts needed to invest, the ways in which that capital can be used and the way in which the program is administered,"" she said. ""It's the most practical way to ensure growth and employment at the local level."" She denied that passage into Canada was for sale. ""Our citizenship is not for sale in this country,"" she said. ""The amount of money invested is not the only criteria here."" Investors account for about three percent of total immigration to Canada each year. Currently they must invest $250,000 Canadian ($180,000) to gain entry. That is being raised to C$450,000 ($325,000) for the richest, most popular destinations -- Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. For the rest of Canada the rate will rise to C$350,000 ($250,000). At least 60 percent of the capital must be invested in small and medium-sized businesses. The provinces will be able to direct the remaining 40 percent to their chosen priorities. The immigrant investor program was introduced in 1986 to attract experienced business people and their money to Canada. The program has attracted C$3.75 billion ($2.74 billion) since its inception and created more than 33,000 jobs, Robillard said. ","HeatherScoffield"
"Britain's opposition Labour party said on Monday that it believed problems at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) could have been uncovered earlier and warned other financial institutions to be more vigilant. ""The preliminary indications are the problem was not determined as soon as it should have been,"" said Alistair Darling, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. ""Alarm bells ought to be ringing in all major institutions. They should ask themselves if something similar could have happened,"" Darling said in a telephone interview. Trading in the three funds, which were worth an estimated 1.4 billion pounds ($2.18 billion), was suspended last week when MGAM, part of the giant Deutsche Bank group, disclosed suspected irregularities in the funds and began a probe. The problems centre on the valuation of the high proportion of speculative unlisted high-technology stocks held in the funds. Trading in the three funds resumed last Thursday after a 180 million pound cash injection by Deutsche. Peter Young, the fund manager of two of the funds, was suspended and an injunction obtained by MGAM and Royal Bank of Scotland, trustee of the funds, to freeze his assets. An in-depth probe spearheaded by investment watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) is underway, and it has brought in accountants to work out how much compensation may be due to the 90,000 investors in the funds. Darling said the problems at MGAM showed the regulatory system was not perfect and there were still problems to be addressed, both by regulators and businesses. ""Good regulatory sense and good business sense go hand-in-hand,"" Darling said, adding that every large organisation should be asking itself if similar irregularities could occur within their own structures. While the Labour party stood by its proposals to make the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) directly responsible for regulating Britain's financial community, it would not make any recommendations on the latest episode until IMRO had completed its investigation into the matter. ""The central question which IMRO needs to look at is how was it possible for these problems to arise,"" Darling said. The fact that a succession of such problems were blamed on a so-called ""rogue trader"" or dealer was also a concern, as it raised the question of how those charged with compliance or those in senior management could miss such dealings. ""I'm concerned that when things go wrong the finger is pointed at a rogue activity. Ideally we want a system where it is simply not possible for one or two people to stray off the path,"" Darling said. He also said the role of trustees of funds was a matter of concern, adding it was important to find a way of ensuring they are not only independent but constantly vigilant. The role of a trustee is to represent the interests of investors and to ensure a fund is managed according to its mandate. ""The public needs to be confident that these funds are properly managed,"" he said. ($1=.6412 Pound) ","AlexanderSmith"
"Music companies are waiting for the world to rock to a new sound that will entice consumers back into record stores and drive up sluggish global sales. Without new global best sellers and an economic upturn, few analysts expect the global market to bask in the double-digit growth seen from 1984 to 1994 when people lined about around the block to get the latest records such as pop group R.E.M.'s ""Monster."" Discounting among retailers, international piracy of cassettes and compact discs and an ageing population, whose first stop at the mall might be a book store rather than a record store, have all hit the more mature markets. Global sales of pre-recorded music reached $39.8 billion in 1996, a 5.5 percent growth in retail value over 1995. Four billion compact discs, cassettes and records -- 4 percent more than in 1995 -- were sold. But the rate of growth is slowing. In retail value, global growth was 6 percent in 1995 and a hefty 15 percent in 1994. The figures, compiled by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which represents the world's record firms, confirm that growth in developing markets is surging. But more mature markets such as North America have been hit by static sales and falling prices. David Chermont, media analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that investors had become used to the lack of ""mind-blowing"" growth, however, in an industry which is made up of a mix of growth and cyclical markets that wax and wane with economic confidence. ""Double-digit growth is not sustainable even in the healthiest markets,"" he said. ""I feel quite comfortable."" Another analyst, who declined to be identified, noted, ""The whole industry can explode if a new sound suddenly arrives on the scene that starts driving sales."" Meanwhile, the main engine of growth has shifted away from the mature, developed markets, the figures show. The IFPI said, ""In 1996 around 70 percent of the world's music growth was generated in less developed markets -- in particularly from Latin America and Asia."" ""This compares to only 20 percent in 1993, when global growth was at a similar level to 1996."" But the trade body brushed aside concerns that the industry was under serious threat by technology such as CD-ROMs, booming international piracy and because the babies borne during the rocking 1960s were now approaching middle age and no longer bought music. ""There is a huge potential in music,"" Nic Garnett, director general of IFPI, told a seminar during London Music Week, noting that the global market had surged from $27 billion to almost $40 billion in the last five years. ""This is very much a thriving, global business,"" he said. ""No market is that mature where the exciting process of new artists coming through cannot re-ignite (it),"" he added. But he called on governments to protect the intellectual property business with copyright laws that prevent ""pirates"" from copying and re-selling cassettes or compact discs at vastly cheaper prices. Piracy is one of the most serious crimes threatening the $35 billion U.S. recording industry and represents losses of over $2 billion every year, the IFPI said. Five big music companies control about two thirds of the market -- PolyGram NV of the Netherlands; Japan's Sony Corp.; Warner, part of Time Warner Inc.; Germany's Bertelsmann AG; and EMI Group Plc of Britain.

"China's stock markets saw heavy turnover on Monday but little change to the key indices as the impact of Deng Xiaoping's death faded and profit-taking set in, analysts said. Investors expect little chance of any political problems emerging to shake the markets, at least for the next few weeks, they said. ""It seems to be all very stable,"" said stock analyst Alex Conroy with ING-Barings in Shanghai. ""I expect range trading for a while. There's no particular reason to be trading in a frenzy."" Shanghai's domestic A share index edged down 0.77 percent to 1,055.078 points on heavy volume of 1.02 billion shares while the B share index was little changed at 65.707 points, inching up just 0.21 percent against the close on Friday last week. In Shenzhen, the A index rose 0.95 percent to 362.69 points and the B index lost 0.15 percent to 150.73 points. ""The markets were under profit-taking pressure after the past two trading days of rises,"" said a Shanghai-based A share dealer with China Guotai Securities. ""Institutional speculative buying of heavily-weighted stocks pushed the (Shanghai B share) index up, but most investors took a wait-and-see attitude as Deng's death has been factored in and there is nothing else happening,"" said one broker. Traders said the markets had expected Deng's death to be this year's biggest negative factor. But the relative calm in the market on Thursday and Friday following Deng's death on Wednesday has helped improve sentiment. ""Shenzhen's A share index extended gains into Monday with fewer worries about stability in China after Deng Xiaoping's death,"" said a Shenzhen-based broker. Some stock analysts said the markets, in the near-term, would likely move in line with company results and technical factors. ""The most important factors in the short term will be company results with the annual report season now getting into full swing,"" said one analyst. ""The (Shanghai's B share) market has entered a correction peroid, and the performance of individual stocks will depend on their annual results,"" said a broker. But others are more cautious. ""I expect most investors to stay on the sidelines in the next few days, waiting for market-moving incentives,"" a Shenzhen-based analyst with a major Chinese brokerage said. ""I would suggest investors have more cash in hand as market sentiment does not appear quite stable,"" a broker said. The Shanghai Securities News on Monday predicted the stock markets will rise steadily in 1997 on the back of an improved national economy. The newspaper forecast in a commentary that Shanghai's composite index would soon rise to more than 1,100 points. The index closed at 1,009.564 points on Monday.

"The deteriorating health of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping has forced Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and other leaders to cut short provincial trips to return to Beijing, sources said on Monday. Party chief and state president Jiang returned at the weekend from a visit to the communist revolutionary base of Ganzhou in central Jiangxi province, said one Chinese source close to the party. Premier Li Peng also flew back to Beijing at the weekend, cutting short a tour of the booming, southern province of Guangdong, said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""Jiang Zemin and Li Peng cut short their trips and rushed back to Beijing because Deng Xiaoping's health was deteriorating,"" the source said. ""They went to see Deng...over the weekend,"" the source said. ""His health is not looking good."" Ninety-two-year-old Deng, whose policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded compound behind the Forbidden City of China's emperors in central Beijing. Diplomats have said one barometer of Deng's health in China's highly-secretive system is the travel of top leaders and close family members, with few willing to be out of town or abroad if Deng were close to death. Chinese sources have reported increasing rumours in Beijing in the past few days that Deng's health may be failing. Chinese officials say there is little change and he is all right for a man of his age. ""I think, for someone of that advanced age, the state of his health should be described as all right,"" said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman last week at a meeting of European and Asian foreign ministers in Singapore. Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper reported at the weekend that the architect of China's sweeping economic reforms had been rushed to hospital on Thursday after a massive stroke that followed an earlier, mild stroke. Rumours about Deng's health surface periodically and Hong Kong stocks tumbled last Friday on one rumour. Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival when he visited Shanghai and appeared frail and faltering. He is now believed to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity. China's elderly leaders exert great influence after their retirement in a society where age is revered and in a communist system in which officials spend years building up power networks. State-run Chinese media have rarely carried reports on Deng since he vanished from public view, partly because of his failing health and his own desire to retire to play a behind-the-scenes role. Deng retired from his last official position in 1990 and his only post is honorary chairman of China's Bridge Association, a title that reflects his passion for the card game. Deng was in the public eye at the start of the new year when state television ran a 12-part documentary on his life, but without details of his present circumstances and without interviews with his wife or children. Western diplomats say the longer Deng lingers the less impact his death will have on the delicate balance of power at the top of China's ruling Communist Party. ","JaneMacartney"
"Electricity generator Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc turned in lower than expected half year profits on Thursday but hiked its dividend by 11 percent. ""We aim to keep on delivering dividend improvement...doing it by expanding the business,"" chief executive Roger Young told Reuters in an interview. Pretax profits edged down to 61.3 million pounds ($101.6 million) from 61.7 million previously, below expectations of 63 to 70.7 million. The dividend was 5.28 pence per share. The shares were down 1-1/2 pence at 316.5p at 1145 GMT. Scottish Hydro said low rainfall had hit profits, as hydro-electric generation had been replaced in part by coal at a cost of 6.3 million pounds. But chairman Lord Wilson said in a statement that the second half had started well and he was confident of ""an encouraging result for the full 12 month period."" Scottish Hydro said it was preferred bidder for the 50 percent stake in Keadby power station, northeast England, owned by United Utilities, its joint venture partner there, and aimed to complete the deal by the end of the current financial year. Young said the plan would ""increase costs but also increase profits"", adding an extra 340 megaWatt of generation capacity to the company's existing portfolio. Scottish Hydro said the deal should increase gearing to around 50 percent if it went ahead and added that together with existing expenditure commitments, gearing should peak at 65 percent in 1998-99. ""We are confident of the prospects for Keadby and look forward to the opportunity to exploit its capabilities in the market place,"" the company said in a statement. Young said the company aimed to boost market share to seven percent from a current four percent by 1999 with a total investment in combined heat and power (CHP) plant for commercial customers of over 150 million pounds. The company said that action taken to raise output and cut costs would improve performance over the next two to three years and added that raising standards was a key aim. Scottish Hydro said that changes proposed to capital allowances in the British budget in November were expected to reverse a trend of falling tax rates but added it would not be possible to predict the impact accurately until full details were known. The company will be looking to expand its domestic business, Young said, but a resumption of talks with British Gas on the sale of the latter's supply interests was unlikely, he added. ""I would not be optimistic of a resumption,"" he said. British Gas announced in September that talks on the sale of its domestic gas supply business in England and Scotland to Scottish Hydro had been called off, scotching newspaper reports that the sale would bring in around 250 million pounds. Young said the breakdown was for administrative rather than commerical reasons. ""There was no serious commercial difficulty that caused the project to be dropped...British Gas had a lot of competition for its (administrative) resources,"" he said. But he said the moment for the deal might now have passed. ""Deals tend to have their day,"" he said, adding that there . were other discussions around, ""but nothing that we can talk about.""

"A top federal regulator Thursday urged banks to be more careful in issuing credit cards as an industry group reported that late payments by consumers jumped to a record level at the end of last year. The latest sign that consumers are overburdened with credit card debt came in survey by the American Bankers Association. The group said that in the fourth quarter of 1996 late payments jumped to 3.72 percent of credit card accounts, the highest rate since it began tracking delinquencies in 1980 and up from 3.34 percent a year earlier. The survey, in conjunction with earlier reports that personal bankruptices are at record levels and bank losses from credit card loans are growing, has bank regulators on edge. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, whose office oversees almost 3,000 nationally chartered banks, said the problems, while still under control, raise concerns about the safety and soundess of banks. ""We are continuing to see signs of slippage in some areas that you and we must address now,"" he told a New York State Bankers Association meeting in Washington on Thursday. ""It is worrisome to consider that there was a 44 percent growth in credit card losses and a 50 percent increase in credit card delinquencies during the past year,"" Ludwig said. Ludwig also noted that bank chargeoffs on credit cards ""increased significantly"" in January to 6.5 percent of the $220 billion of loans outstanding from 4.7 percent a year earlier. ""These statistics are particularly troubling given the current health of the economy,"" he said. As a result, the Comptroller's office issued an advisory to banks on credit underwriting standards and portfolio credit risk management, Ludwig said. ""The role of the regulator is to take action before potential problems become real problems,"" Ludwig said. ""Our goal is to remind national banks how changes in underwriting standards affect overall portfolio credit risk and to highlight the key component of an effective portfolio credit risk management process."" Tighter loan standards should prevent the problem from getting out of hand, but losses may grow further before the new standards have an impact, Ludwig said. ""Current losses likely represent weaker credits making their way through the pipeline,"" he said. ""We can expect some continued losses, but hopefully we'll begin to see positive effects of those cautious underwriting decisions."" Bankers had expected that tighter credit standards put into place in recent years would already have started reducing losses. ""We are disappointed that the numbers didn't improve,"" American Bankers Association chief economist James Chessen said. ""We had hoped that banks' tightening of credit standards over the last several years would have reversed the trend of delinquencies by now."" In the fourth quarter of 1996, 37 percent of banks reported tightening standards, a drop from 49 percent in both the second and third quarters of 1996, the association said. Delinquency rates also ticked up on home equity loans, the group reported. The delinquency rate was 1.42 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.29 percent in the previous quarter and 1.41 percent in the same period the previous year. On auto loans, the delinquency rate was 2.03 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.95 percent the previous quarter and 1.87 percent a year earlier. Delinquent payments are defined as 30 days or more overdue. ","AaronPressman"
"Exports of Ivorian cocoa totalled 150,000 tonnes in January taking the 1996/97 season's cumulative total to 416,000 tonnes since October 1, port sources said on Tuesday. ""Warehouses are still full,"" said one port source. Latest figures on arrivals of cocoa at ports were not immediately available but are widely expected to total 800,000 tonnes since October 1. The figures, for Abidjan and San Pedro ports, were expected to be clearer this week. Total dedicated warehouse space is put by sources at close to 400,000 tonnes, meaning stocks of around the same amount. Quality inspectors said bean humidity levels were around 7.5-8.0 percent with grain sizes of 95-100 beans per 100 grammes. Export standards allow a maximum of eight percent humidity and 105 beans per 100 grammes. Shipping line managers said break bulk (loose beans in holds) shipment of cocoa was proving more popular with clients than shipment in containers. ""There is a lot of demand for mega-bulk,"" said one shipping line manager, referring to the trade name for loose bulk, increasingly favoured by Amsterdam-based cocoa processors. Higher-than-expected arrivals of cocoa, coupled with low overseas demand and world prices, and difficulty in obtaining export contracts led to the build-up of stocks in January. Forwarders expect large shipments to leave against March delivery. Some exporters have held on to stock in the hope of rising prices. Prices last week hit 18-month lows. Arrivals figures are expected this week to indicate whether volumes reaching ports will tail off ahead of the April-Sept mid-crop. Exporters expect a total crop of around a million tonnes but private forecasters have said a good mid-crop could take total volumes closer to 1.1 million tonnes -- still short of last season's record 1.2 million tonnes. A firmer idea of mid-crop prospects is expected later this month as flower survival rates and pod-setting patterns emerge. Official port statistics for January will not be available until February. Official cumulative exports for the first three months of the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) season were shown as only 309,762 tonnes compared with 270,257 tonnes in the same period of 1995/96. -- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"As mining officials the world over await test results that may solve the puzzle of an Indonesian gold deposit, reports Sunday suggested the news may be bad for Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and its controversial Busang find. Calgary-based Bre-X is expected to release the long-awaited study by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. before North American markets open on Monday. But Bre-X officials on Sunday declined to comment on a report that the company will urge more tests to determine just how much gold is at Busang. ""Bre-X will argue that what's now needed is a large bulk sample from the Busang site for further testing,"" the Toronto Star newspaper quoted an unnamed Bre-X insider as saying. ""Any mining company in our position would want further testing,"" the source was quoted as saying. A bulk sample would involve more extensive drilling, sampling and assaying of the site. Strathcona's report is based on samples from six holes drilled at Busang. Some observers said talk of a bulk sample suggested the Strathcona report was negative for Bre-X, which has estimated Busang contains 71 million ounces of gold, potentially the richest site in the world. ""If the rumor is (Bre-X) needs a bulk sample, then that's because the small amount of sampling that has been done is disappointing,"" George Duncan, president of mining consultant Acurrassay Laboratories, said by telephone Sunday. Duncan said Strathcona President Graham Farquharson is well regarded within the mining community and has a reputation for being conservative in his findings. ""Somebody once said he is a mine buster,"" Duncan said. Bre-X hired Strathcona to review the project in March after doubts emerged over what has been called the gold find of the century. Busang partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. said on March 26 that its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold. That same day, Strathcona told Bre-X the gold at Busang may have been overstated due to invalid procedures. The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion U.S.) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11). Other analysts predicted the final word on Busang will only come after further drilling. ""This deposit is going to have to be drilled off,"" John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada, said Sunday. ""My guess is that there is gold there, but what really made this deposit was the size and the higher grade. Presumably, the higher grade is not there,"" he said. With billions of dollars in limbo, nervous shareholders have traded rumors for weeks on Internet chat sites. Bre-X's stock closed up 19 cents (14 cents) at C$3.23 ($2.34) on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday. The TSE has set special trading rules for Bre-X shares on Monday to handle the huge volumes expected when the Strathcona report is released. Frantic trading after Freeport's announcement in March overwhelmed the TSE's computer trading system. The Strathcona report will be closely watched by some shareholders who have launched class-action lawsuits against Bre-X and some of its key officials. The suits charge that Bre-X executives gave inflated projections about the size of Busang's gold deposits so they could pump up the stock and sell it off for big profits. The Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's top securities regulator, is currently probing Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws. Foreign investors are also monitoring the outcome of the Bre-X affair, which has tarnished Canada's reputation within the world mining community. Other major mining countries, particularly Australia, have criticized Canada for its lax regulation of smaller mining companies. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"Facing financial strains, companies that won wireless phone licenses at last year's $10.2 billion federal auction are urging the government to take steps to make it easier for them to pay off their bids, industry and government sources say. Top bidders NextWave Telecom Inc. and Pocket Communications Inc., plus several other winners, have asked regulators for a more lenient timetable to pay the government for licenses to offer a new generation of cellular service, the sources said this week. NextWave's winning bids totaled $4.7 billion, while Washington-based Pocket's added up to $1.4 billion. The bids have become loans from the government, with the winners paying interest on the money owed for the licenses. They want to make the hefty interest payments annually, instead of quarterly. The added time would help the companies, which face rough sledding on Wall Street, drum up money to build ""personal communications services,"" or PCS, systems. The winners at the 1996 Federal Communication Commission auction, reserved for small firms, paid a price more than double that paid by big carriers like AT&amp;T Corp. in 1995. ""These guys have a ticking time bomb on their hands,"" a Wall Street source said of the existing payment schedule. Industry officials also want the FCC to clarify certain repayment rules. And they want the Treasury Department to take over from the FCC the job of payment collection, hoping the department's financial expertise will spell relief for cash-strapped firms. ""Anything that makes it easier for companies to pay is going to make the companies more attractive to investors,"" said attorney Lynn Charytan of Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering, who represents Pocket Communications. FCC officials are mulling their options. ""Our existing rules provide some flexibility. Whether that's enough flexibility is under consideration,"" said one agency official. PCS technology is expected to make the wireless phone a mass-market product, allowing consumers to use different communications services -- such as phone, paging, fax and Internet access -- through a single handheld device. Earlier this month, NextWave, Pocket and seven other PCS winners asked the FCC to permit annual interest payments. The companies, in a letter to the FCC's wireless bureau obtained by Reuters, said annual payments would give them more flexibility to tap the stock and bond markets when conditions are favorable. And they said such payments would let them capitalize on the new World Trade Organization pact on telecommunications. The agreement is expected to make it easier for foreign investment in U.S. communications companies. The companies said the competitive pressure to build their PCS systems quickly ""places a strain"" on new entrants to the business, ""whose challenge is further complicated by an increasingly cautious domestic investment climate."" Investors are wary of betting on wireless carriers out of fear the market is becoming flooded with competitors. ""I see no reason why the capital markets will be any kinder to wireless companies in '97 than in '96,"" said analyst Johathan Atkin of BIA Consulting Inc. in Chantilly, Va. Industry officials also want the FCC to clarify whether a company would be in default on all of their licenses if it misses an interest payment on just one of the permits. The FCC's rules do not address that issue. The agency is seeking comment on whether to issue a clarification. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt two weeks ago broached the idea of making the Treasury responsible for payment collection. He cited a ""tension created by the FCC's present dual role as regulator of and creditor to the wireless industry."" Advocates argue the changes -- including the more lenient payment schedule -- are in the FCC's interest. For one, they would mean less paperwork for the agency. And they said it would be counterproductive for several companies to default on payments. That could hurt the bidding at future airwave auctions and lower the potential price for any PCS licenses the FCC re-auctions after a default. Some industry officials suggested the FCC may not want to appear too willing to change the rules and be accused of catering to industry interests. ","RogerFillion"
"Chrysler Corp., moving to shed its last defense subsidiary, said Monday it agreed to sell Pentastar Electronics Inc. to a management-led investment group for less than $50 million. Pentastar Electronics, based in Huntsville, Ala., produces electronic test equipment for tanks and other military systems. A remnant of Chrysler's former position as the nation's major tank builder, Pentastar has about 350 employees and annual sales in the $50-million range. Terms of the sale to PEI Acquisition Corp. were not announced, but the price is less than Pentastar's annual revenues, said Tom Noojin, Chairman of Huntsville-based Hickory Venture Capital Corp., the major financial partner in the deal. Chrysler said it hoped to close the sale before the end of 1996, but noted that the certain conditions may push the closing into 1997. A company spokeswoman declined to say whether the automaker would book a gain on the deal. The new company, which will operate as PEI Electronics Inc., also negotiated significant changes to the new United Auto Workers contract at the plant. Noojin said the deal preserved UAW wages and benefits for current workers, but allowed PEI to hire new workers at lower wages that are more typical of the defense industry. The company also won permission to change work rules and job classifications inside the plant to improve efficiency. Existing PEI workers, however, will have opportunities to transfer back to Chrysler's Acustar Electronics unit in Huntsville, which makes automotive electronics. ""This could not have gone through without the cooperation of the United Auto Workers,"" Noojin said. ""As a stand-alone facility, the union would have made this company non-competitive."" UAW officials could not be immediately reached for comment on the pact. PEI expects to hire about 200 new workers over the next 12 months as it executes expansion plans that were curtailed over the past two years by Chrysler's efforts to sell the subsidiary, Noojin said. He added that Hickory, an affiliate of Memphis-based First Tennessee National Corp., will remain a passive investor. Joseph Ritch, another local investor in the deal, said the company hoped to expand its business by developing commercial applications for its diagnostic test equipment, which plugs into tanks and other equipment to help technicians make repairs. The transaction will complete Chrysler's plans to divest all of its aerospace and defense businesses. The automaker in June sold Electrospace Systems Inc., a defense electronics unit, and Chrysler Technologies Airborne Systems Inc. to Raytheon Co.'s E-Systems Inc. unit for $475 million. Chrysler sold its tank business in 1981 to General Dynamics Corp. Chrysler also has said it wants to divest other non-core businesses, such as its Dollar and Thrifty rental car chains, as part of its plans to focus on its core automotive business. Separately, Chrysler said it had broken an eight-year-old record for U.S. calendar year sales with more than a month to go in the year. Chrysler said its 1996 sales through November 22 reached 2,214,289 cars and trucks, toppling the company's 1988 record of 2,208,057 vehicles. Chrysler shares rose 37.5 cents Monday on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $34.875. ","DavidLawder"
"A Czech cabinet decision to require deposits on consumer goods imports will be less harmful for inflation than the rejected option of import surcharges but may have little impact on the trade deficit, analysts said on Friday. But they praised a government plan, revealed on Wednesday as part of an economic revival package, to cut public sector wage growth to 7.3 percent this year from the planned 11.9 percent, saying this would be more effective in pushing down demand for imported products than the deposit programme. The analysts polled by Reuters said the deposit programme, which will come into effect on Monday, would not have a great impact on consumer prices. Under the deposit scheme, importers will be required to deposit 20 percent of the value of imported consumer goods on an interest-free account for 180 days. The commercial banks will channel the money from their branches to state-held development bank Konsolidacni Banka. Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, officially announcing the new measure on Friday, said he hoped the restriction would reverse the trend of the widening trade deficit, but did not make a more specific forecast. ""Deposits are a better way than an import surcharge, which would raise inflation, and import quotas, which would be unwelcome internationally,"" said ING Barings analyst Boris Gomez. He saw little impact on the trade deficit from the deposit scheme but added that imports could fall as a result of a decline in domestic demand caused by lower wage growth. ""I believe that the government will be able to go ahead with the wage restrictions. The question is whether the private sector will follow,"" Gomez said. Minister Dlouhy said the deposits would apply to some 30 percent of imports, including selected foodstuffs, cars, electronics, textile products, furniture, and appliances. Vladimir Kreidl of investment bank Patria Finance said the wage growth limits were ""very drastic and ambitious"" and said staff were likely to be laid off in order to meet the target. ""If well implemented, the measures should benefit the economy...The trade deficit should be reduced by 30-50 billion crowns from the originally expected 200-220 billion (1997 deficit),"" Kreidl said. The trade gap rose to 160.3 billion crowns last year from under 100 billion in 1995, and official estimates before imposition of the import deposits were projecting this year's deficit to range around 210 billion. But Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka said the import deposits would have virtually no impact on the trade balance. ""I am leaving my prediction (of the foreign trade deficit) unchanged at 180 billion,"" he said, adding that a major change could come only through a change of the exchange rate policy. Analysts said the programme would have minimal impact on inflation, which fell to 6.8 percent year on year in March. ""The effect in the cost of imported goods would be a year-on-year increase in inflation of about 0.3-0.4 percent,"" said Jack Schrantz, head of research at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment in Prague. ""But this will be offset by other factors such as decreased government spending and a slowdown in the economy,"" he added. Other measures taken by the cabinet include 25.5 billion in budget cuts, setting up an independent capital market oversight body, promoting exports, and fighting more intensively against economic crime. The package also calls for speeding up privatisation of state-held companies, relaxation of monetary policy, and separation of banks' investment and commercial arms. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"The French government on Wednesday called off the controversial sale of electronics group Thomson SA in a major policy U-turn after weeks of staunchly defending its choice of buyer. It was the second privatisation to be halted in less than a month after a decision to suspend the sale of state-owned bank CIC. It comes at a time when Prime Minister Alain Juppe, at a record low in opinion polls, is anxious to avoid another labour revolt following last month's truckers stoppage. The Finance Ministry said in a statement the suspension of the proposed Thomson sell-off to Lagardere Groupe was due to objections to the planned sale of the company's consumer electronics unit to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics. But the office of Prime Minister Alain Juppe said renewed talks about the sale could start soon. ""The government will launch consultations as rapidly as possible allowing the privatisation to take place on a basis that will be defined very quickly,"" Juppe was quoted as saying. ""The aim of privatising Thomson addresses the necessity for France to have an electronics and defence industry of global standing,"" he said. Industry Minister Franck Borotra said in a statement the privatisation of Thomson remained essential ""The goal of privatisation of Thomson, and in particular TMM (Thomson Multimedia), remains essential for the future of the company,"" Borotra said. ""TMM needs to cuts its debt, enter new markets and improve its competitiveness in order to better exploit its technological and human resources,"" he added. Several thousand workers of Thomson Multimedia marched in Paris and other cities on November 20 to protest against a sale to a booming Asian competitor, fearing for their jobs and working conditions. Staff were also enraged by Juppe telling parliament in October their hi-tech company was worthless. The prime minister said the company was ""worth not even a franc, it is worth 14 billion francs of debt."" The government said in October it had picked Lagardere because it was best for French defence interests and would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc after a 10.8 billion franc ($2 billion) state capital injection. Lagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58-percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its own Matra Defense Espace. The Finance Ministry's surprise suspension announcement came on the day the European Commission had been expected to give the green light to the deal. The ministry said the Privatisation Commission ""declared itself incapable of giving a favourable opinion to the Lagardere Groupe offer, because of the terms of Daewoo Electronics' purchase of Thomson Multimedia."" It added the companies could continue their discussions with the Privatisation Commission and the state would pursue talks with the European Commission about conditions for a capital increase, on which Brussels had expressed reservations. Shares in Lagardere and Thomson-CSF were suspended, while those of Alcatel fell three percent with investors expecting the group to make a new bid that could create uncertainties about the financing and its own profit recovery. Lagardere said in a statement it was still interested in taking over Thomson, which it said was of strategic importance. A spokesman for Alcatel Alsthom said only that the company ""took note"" of the decision. ""The chances (for Alcatel) have got to be increased by this, if they can come up with a different offer,"" said a Paris share broker, adding the decision was a blow to the government's standing. ""It doesn't look good for the French government."" Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk recently said he was ready to make a new offer for Thomson, breaking weeks of silence after French newspapers suggested Chirac might have been influenced by a disputed report of British plans to take over the company. Britain's GEC has said it is willing to talk about a cooperation deal with whoever wins Thomson. ($1=5.271 French Franc) ","MarcelMichelson"
"Automakers, eager to fill Americans' insatiable appetite for sport/utility vehicles, plan to introduce a variety of new models at next week's North American International Auto show here. The annual festival in Detroit features new heights in size, style, luxury and refinement for the once-crude go-anywhere haulers. Analysts are watching most closely the public reaction to Ford Motor Co.'s new luxury behemoth, the Lincoln Navigator, and Chrysler Corp.'s smaller Dodge Durango, which borrows its meaty front-end styling from the Dodge Dakota pickup truck. But they also have their eyes on Subaru's new Forester, a car-based hybrid sport/utility vehicle that is among the first of a coming new breed of vehicles with truck-like bodies atop passenger car underpinnings. The industry's continued fixation on sport/utility vehicles is understandable. U.S. compact sport/utility sales were the second-fastest growing segment in the industry in 1996, increasing 17.9 percent through November to 1,575,627 units and making up 11.3 percent of the market. The only segment to grow faster was full-size sport/utility vehicles, up 51.5 percent to 379,260 vehicles through November. ""They're technically trucks, but a whole lot of people driving them don't know they're trucks,"" said James Holden, Chrysler's executive vice president of sales and marketing. ""The minivans and Jeeps are in suburban garages all over the place, so the definition of trucks is sort of blurring."" In 1996, trucks, including sport/utility vehicles and minivans made up 66 percent of Chrysler's total vehicle sales. The introduction of the Durango -- slightly larger than Ford's Explorer -- is expected to push that percentage even higher, and Holden said new sport/utility vehicles will push up other automakers' truck mix as well. Ford is trying to push the luxury limits of the segment with the Navigator, a vehicle based on the F-150 pickup truck swathed in soft leather and likely to be priced in the same mid-$40,000 range as the Range Rover and Lexus LX450 vehicle. Ford also is testing the consumer waters with two other concept sport/utilities, including an all-wheel drive version of its Taurus station wagon and a design study for a future Explorer model featuring more aggressive styling. Mercedes-Benz also aims to whet the appetites of luxury sport/utility buyers by showing off the chassis for its Alabama-built M-Class sport/utility, which enters production next year. It is not showing off the vehicle's body, which is expected to be toned down from a concept vehicle shown at last year's show. Mercedes also will spotlight a segment that has received little attention in recent years -- the luxury coupe -- by introducing its new CLK coupe to the world. The car borrows its elliptical headlamp styling from the larger E-Class sedan. General Motors Corp., which dominated last year's show with the introduction of four new mid-size sedans, is expected to limit its splash to sports car buffs with the introduction of its first all-new Corvette in 14 years. The fifth-generation plastic-bodied 'Vette is expected to offer more power and performance, but also more comfort and interior room for drivers and luggage. More practical cars also are scheduled for introduction, including Ford's new Escort coupe, and Chrysler's next-generation LH family sedans -- the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde, LHS and Eagle Vision. Toyota Motor Corp will unveil its first serious assault on the U.S. minivan market, an all-new U.S.-built minivan based on the Camry family sedan. The Toyota Sienna is scheduled for introduction later this year. ""This is the first real Japanese foray into a North American stronghold,"" said Michael Robinet, an auto analyst with CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich.

"International music and film group PolyGram on Wednesday reported an almost 18 percent fall in earnings after taking dramatic action to respond to a slowdown in record sales. PolyGram's 1996 net income after tax and extraordinary items dropped to 608 million guilders ($327.4 million) from 741 million guilders in 1995. The company held its dividend at 0.95 guilders per share. The results topped market forecasts and PolyGram shares surged 4.80 guilders to 88.10 on the Amsterdam stock exchange on Wednesday morning. PolyGram took a post-tax charge of 114 million guilders as it reorganised its music operations, cutting some 400 jobs. That move came as the music industry stalled after a decade of rapid growth. Global music sales had risen to $40 billion dollars in 1995 from $14 billion in 1986 but the rate of growth slowed to an estimated three percent last year. ""This will be a challenging year for PolyGram's music division, particularly in the U.S. where market instability is likely to persist for the next six to 12 months,"" PolyGram president and CEO Alain Levy said. ""Nevertheless, we remain optimistic that our continued success in breaking new talent and the measures we have taken to adapt to changing markets around the world will create the right conditions for long-term growth,"" he added. Levy told Reuters that PolyGram, which boasts artists such as U2, Van Morrison, Elton John and The Cranberries, should see some swift benefits from its restructuring. He said there should be some positive effects this year but added: ""That is not essential. What is essential is to be adapted (to market conditions)"". PolyGram is restructuring the operations of its Motown unit, moving the label's headquarters from Los Angeles to New York as it seeks to recreate its heyday of the 1960s and early 1970s. It is also reorganising its European music distribution and marketing operations and restructuring its classical music division. PolyGram's music division increased its sales by five percent to 7.95 billion guilders but operating profit dipped slightly to 1.11 billion guilders as margins were squeezed. PolyGram's infant film division moved into profit in the second half of last year thanks to the success of films such as Sleepers, Mr Holland's Opus and Dead Man Walking. The division has secured 14 Oscar nominations this year. Levy said that the film business had done ""extremely well"" in its four years of operation but was now entering a crucial phase as it moved into bigger budget movies.

"Hong Kong's property sector on Thursday assailed the government over new measures to try to curb sky-high housing prices. Property developers and analysts said the measures announced on Wednesday were not only inappropriate in a free-wheeling society but also may not work. ""It is an unwarranted intervention in normal commercial decision-making process,"" the Real Estate Developers' Association of Hong Kong said in a statement. ""It attacks the very foundation of Hong Kong's free market economy principle."" The government's regulations require developers to put unfinished flats on to the market earlier than before. Private flats must now be put up for sale 15 months before they are ready instead of 12 months previously. For government-subsidised flats, the period has been extended to 24 months from between 12 and 18 months at present. In addition, developers will have to put flats on to the market within six months of the government granting approval for them to sell, and to release no less than 20 percent of every batch of housing units that is built. The moves quickly drew fire. Some analysts said the government was tackling only the symptoms of the problem and not tackling its roots. ""You can go on for eternity producing short-term remedies. All they are doing is dealing with the symptoms at the moment, and not dealing with the actual cause (that) can only be eradicated by planning,"" said Paul Dwyer, head of Vigers Corporate Valuation Consultancy. Another analyst with an Asian firm said the measures could backfire. ""This mere pushing forward of units in an environment where supply is already very tight...if anything, will provide room for more speculation as more units are in the market now,"" he said. ""Prices could rise faster as demand is very strong, so the government is actually shooting itself in the foot,"" he said. While the government's pledge to release some 587 hectares (1,450 acres) of land for residential use earned some bouquets, the property community urged it to do more. ""We've got industrial land but nobody wants to build on industrial space in Hong Kong,"" said Dwyer. ""It's a matter of rezoning this land, putting money in to create the infrastructure and enhancing the environmental atmosphere, then you'll be able to use this land for residential purposes."" A major property developer, who declined to be identified, criticised as unfair the requirement to push on to the market at least 20 percent of unfinished flats in every batch of units. ""It's like a regulation requiring a restaurant to cook 20 percent of its eggs, 20 percent of its lamb, regardless of whether they have customers outside,"" he told Reuters. Hong Kong's seemingly endless property boom, which has not been threatened by the British territory's imminent handover to Chinese rule, was highlighted this week when developer Sino Land Co Ltd paid a record HK$11.82 billion (US$1.53 billion) for a residential site on Hong Kong island. --Hong Kong newsroom (852) 28436441 ","TanEeLyn"
"British insurance and asset management giant Prudential Corp Plc on Wednesday beat analysts' forecasts with an eight percent rise in first half profits to 421.0 million pounds ($655 million). Prudential chief executive Peter Davis said the company wanted to buy a home loan lender to build its customer base but he refused to be drawn on which building society, if any, the Prudential was talking to. ""We are interested in buying a building society but for its branch network and its customer base rather than its mortgage book,"" Davis said in an interview. The Prudential, which next month will launch a telephone banking business, raised its interim dividend by 9.4 percent to 5.8 pence per share. The first-half data included 33 million pounds of start-up costs for the new banking operation, which chief executive Peter Davis said was on course for launch on October 1. Davis said the life insurance business was benefiting from a general upturn in consumer confidence in Britain. ""Customers are feeling a little more confident and are more willing to make commitments."" But Davis noted that single contribution products were still showing far more growth than those that require a longer-term commitment or regular contributions. Prudential's single contribution sales rose by 50 percent in the first half of the year compared with a gain of 15 percent for regular contribution sales. Davis said the personal pensions industry had still not completely thrown off the stigma of a private pensions scandal in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said consumers were starting to realise they must make adequate pension provision. Prudential said funds under management had risen by four percent since the end of 1995 to 85 billion pounds. Profit from this business rose to 14 million pounds from eight million in the first half of last year. Davis hoped there would be no lasting knock-on effect on the fund management industry from recent events at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), but said the affair was sure to make investors look closely at the standing of the institution with which they have their money invested. ""It's likely to be a swings and roundabouts thing,"" Davis said. ""There will probably be a general loss of confidence but we will also see some flight to quality and security.""

"French chocolate group CEMOI is building a new cocoa processing factory in Ivory Coast which will open in October 1997, the company's managing director said on Wednesday. ""The factory can process 60,000 tonnes of beans a year,"" Managing Director Patrique Poivrier told Reuters by telephone from CEMOI's headquarters at Perpignan, in the south of France. He put the cost of the project at 160 million French francs. Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual crop locally by the year 2000 to add export value and remove lower quality late season (May-Sept), or mid-crop, beans from international markets. CEMOI's factory would open at its full capacity but could be upgraded to 120,000 tonnes after two years, producing cocoa liquor and cocoa cake and butter, Poivrier said. Work began at the construction site in northern Abidjan (Yopougon) on Friday, he added. CEMOI, one of Europe's largest chocolate confectioners, uses 40,000 tonnes of raw cocoa beans a year and would sell products from the extra 20,000 tonnes capacity mainly to Europe and perhaps China. ""We are also looking at markets in China,"" he said. Poivrier said the factory had been planned to secure a regular supply of good quality cocoa and by-pass Ivorian commodity exporters. Ivory Coast already has three cocoa processing factories with capacity for processing up to 160,000 tonnes of beans a year. Europe's Callebaut Barry group owns two factories. Ivorian exporter SIFCA owns a third, with some share participation from U.S.-based Arthur Daniels Midland. It plans to expand capacity by 21,000 tonnes by 1998.

""Sooner or later the market will realise that 30 percent is too much of a premium to pay (for control of MCI),"" said Oliver Ehrenberg, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming. Shareholders in MCI Communications Corp, America's second biggest long-distance carrier, were voting on the merger on Wednesday, while BT investors are due to vote on April 15. One key investment institution in London said it remained largely neutral on the deal. ""It looks as if it has some advantages but it also looks like quite a high price,"" the institution, which asked not to be identified, told Reuters. Top BT executives have been meeting large institutions to discuss the rationale for buying the 80 percent of MCI that BT does not already own. But BT, whose shares outperformed the market during a recent road show to market the deal to investors on both sides of the Atlantic, said the response from most had been ""very positive"". ""Obviously there is a large amount of money at stake,"" a BT spokesman said. ""I think generally speaking people understand why we are doing it...There is a very good business case for why it is being done."" The merger between BT and entrepreneurial MCI, which the two groups expect to clear regulatory hurdles by the autumn, will create a powerhouse called Concert Plc. The combined business will have annual revenues of more than 25 billion pounds ($41.2 billion), annual cash flow of about 7.5 billion pounds and 43 million business and residential customers. Concert wants to provide clients around the globe with local, long distance, international and mobile phone services as well as multi-media, Internet-based services and systems integration for business clients. BT has promised that the merger, after an initial five percent earnings dilution, will yield savings from combining overlapping services of 1.5 billion pounds over the first five years and 500 million pounds pre-tax annually after that. The United States is the world's largest telecoms market. It is also home to 40 percent of the world's largest multinational company headquarters -- some of the most valuable customers for global telecoms alliances. While analysts expect powerful institutional investors to back BT in its attempt to gain a firmer foothold in the U.S. telecoms market, some have questioned whether a 2.5 billion pound premium for the rest of MCI will yield the ""tremendous growth prospects"" promised by the two companies. ""We hear the arguments brought foward to support the deal, but we do question whether the merger will translate into enhanced returns for former BT shareholders,"" says Ehrenberg. BT promises continuing dividend growth. But MCI, which plans hefty investments to grab a share of the local U.S. telecoms market, says the major attraction of the deal is BT's strong financial resources. ""With increased competition and enormous investment demands, we think investors will increasingly wonder whether Concert can really increase its dividends by six percent per annum for the forseeable future...,"" Ehrenerg says. Fleming, which says the company's gearing level might surge to 150 percent in the next three years, has downgraded its recommendation on BT to ""sell"" because it says the group's valuation looks stretched against other European telecom groups. BT has already raised its intitial gearing projection from around 65 percent to 80 or 90 percent since last November. But Fleming's gearing calculation includes a 1-1.2 billion pound windfall tax if Britain's opposition Labour Party wins the May 1 election, an approximate 1.6 billion pound acquisition of the remaining 40 percent of BT's mobile phone business Cellnet as well as other investments in Europe and Asia. SBC Warburg is less negative. The broker has recommended buying the stock, saying BT will create ""substantial value"" in its international investments and growth businesses. Its official share price target is 480 pence. BT's shares climbed 4p to 431.5p on Wednesday. ($ = 0.606 British Pounds) ","KirstinRidley"
"Toronto's key stock index closed higher on Tuesday with a boost from soaring banking issues, but the broader market was pulled lower by weakness in the heavily weighted gold group. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index rose 45.65 points to end at 6126.92. However declining issues edged out advances 515 to 479, while another 300 traded flat. ""The banking sector did well,"" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie. Canada's six biggest banks soared to record heights after influential U.S. investment firm Goldman Sachs hiked ratings on five out of the six. The financial services sector rose more than 1.7 percent. However, ""we've still got a problem in the gold sector,"" Beattie said. Golds continued to tumble on dropping bullion prices. Trading was brisk today at 102.9 million valued at C$1.76 billion ($1.3 billion). Ten of Toronto's 14 sub-indices surged, led by consumer products, banks, conglomerates and oils. The weaker sectors were golds, transportation, forestry products and media. The hottest stocks were the banks. The Royal Bank of Canada jumped 1.60 to close at 54.85, below its new high of 55.30. Goldman Sachs put Canada's largest bank on its recommended list, along with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the nation's second biggest. CIBC shares rose 1.25 to end at 66.70, also below a new record of 67.50. Despite being left out of the upgrades, the Bank of Montreal, the third largest, rose 1.10 to 50.15. Base and precious metals miner Princeton Mining lost two cents to reach 0.42 on nearly three million shares, topping Toronto's most actives. It announced a private placement of special warrants at C$0.35 per share, convertible to one common share each, to raise C$5.4 million ($4 million). ","LydiaZajc"
"International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings that were slightly better than expected, bolstered by its service business, growth in software sales and tight expense controls. The world's largest computer maker said net income rose about 18 percent to $2.02 billion in the quarter from $1.71 billion in the 1995 quarter. Earnings per share rose faster, to $3.93 from $3.09, since IBM had 7 percent fewer shares outstanding in the quarter due to stock buybacks. Wall Street analysts had expected profits of $3.88 a share on average, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates. Analysts and investors said the results looked good, but some said IBM stock might come under profit-taking pressure on Wednesday. ""It's an excellent number, it's an excellent quarter. You really can't say anything bad about it. But I think it may cause a brief period of selling because Wall Street (sells) on that kind of news,"" said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood. ""They were mixed results, software and services were great"" and European results were somewhat encouraging, said David Takata, a Gruntal &amp; Co. analyst. But he said weak mainframe computer revenues were disappointing. Some analysts had been predicting mainframe revenues rose in the quarter due to strong new products. The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer maker said service revenues jumped 22 percent in the quarter and personal computer sales rose, but sales of mainframes fell and RS/6000 minicomputers were flat. Software revenues rose 4 percent in the quarter, and hardware sales increased 2 percent. Revenues overall rose 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion. Expenses fell 2 percent in the quarter from the 1995 period, IBM said. ""We showed good growth in the fourth quarter despite a difficult year-over-year comparison, continued weakness in Europe and a greater-than-expected currency impact,"" IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner said in a statement. ""Although we still face many challenges, IBM is a much different company than it was only a few years ago,"" he said, noting IBM's services business accounted for 21 percent of revenues at the end of 1996 compared to 13 percent in 1993. The impact of converting revenues received in foreign currencies into dollars erased three percentage points from the fourth-quarter revenue gain, IBM said. That compared with about a two point positive impact in the 1995 quarter. Net earnings for the year rose to $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share, from $4.2 billion, or $7.23 a share, in 1995. The 1996 results included a charge for research and development from the acquisition of Lotus Development Corp. Full-year revenues rose 5.6 percent to $75.95 billion from $71.94 billion. In a break with tradition, IBM released its results after the stock market closed rather than before the market opened. Analysts said there was no particular significance to IBM reporting after the close. IBM was trying to avoid the drastic swings in its stock that have come during a conference call with analysts it hosts after the earnings are released. The stock closed up $1 at $168 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. By region, revenues in North America rose 11 percent to $9.6 billion in the fourth quarter, Asia-Pacific rose 6 percent to $4.3 billion and Latin America gained 4.0 percent to $1.1 billion. Revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were $8.1 billion, little changed year over year. ","TheresePoletti"
"Scottish-based Stakis Plc on Wednesday reported a surge in visitors to its casinos and a sharp rise in its hotel room rates, with chief executive David Michel in confident mood about future trends. ""In real terms we are just back to where room rates were in the late 1980s. Room rates have just about reached their pre-recession levels in the provinces,"" Michels told Reuters. The company's hotels, excluding the Metropole in London acquired in November for 327 million stg ($543 million) from Lonrho, showed an occupancy level of 71.8 percent in the first 13 weeks of 1997, a touch down from 72 percent last time. But its average room rate rose to 50.10 stg over the same period, up from 45.58 in 1996. ""In the first quarter we did 10 percent, but I still think the average will be 7.5 percent or more over the year,"" said Michels. ""Our forecast is to finish this year at 76 percent occupancy,"" he added. Although January was a typically dull month for hotel occupancy, future bookings are at similar levels to last year, giving every confidence Stakis can achieve its target, he said. The group's hotel occupancy was also pulled back slightly in the period by the temporary closure of the Stakis Tyneside where work is underway on a 3.5 million stg refurbishment. During the six weeks Metropole traded under the Stakis flag, it showed 64.7 percent occupancy at an average price per room of 64.77 stg for its 2,266 rooms. In a trading statement, Stakis said attendance at its 23 casinos rose to 603,000 in the quarter up from 525,000, but the spend per head fell to 110 stg from 129 . Turnover at the casinos rose 20 percent to 14.2 million stg driven by the 17 percent increase in attendances. The fall in spend per head mainly reflected the sale of the Barracuda casino in April last year to Ladbroke, said Michel. The spend per head at the Barracuda averaged 450 stg. But Michel was encouraged by the increased casino attendance. ""More people realise that they are a reasonable night out, you don't have to spend 100 stg,"" he said. ""We have spent a year trying to make them do so, we've made a number of conversions, one big new build, and promotions to our base membership of 900,000, and we have introduced new training tables."" The improvements coincided with an increase in newspaper and television interest in casinos. Stakis shares were up 1-1/2p at 103p in early trade. ($1=.6021 Pound) ","TimFarrand"
"General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jack Welch defended his $28.2 million in salary, bonuses and incentives for 1996, telling shareholders Wednesday that market forces determined pay packages for top U.S. executives. ""The issue is the competitive marketplace,"" he told a critic at GE's annual meeting. ""The market is willing to play at a certain level ..."" Stockholders at the meeting defeated a proposal to limit Welch's pay to $1 million unless put to a shareholder vote. The proposal to limit Welch's pay received 9 percent of the votes cast, with 91 percent backing Welch's existing compensation arrangements. Bill Patterson of the AFL-CIO group of labor unions, a supporter of the effort to put a cap on Welch's paycheck, said Welch's compensation was 148 times more than that paid on average to GE's 239,000 employees. The proposal was made by a Teamsters union pension fund. Patterson said the pay, even with Welch's highly acclaimed management successes and the stellar stock market performance of GE's shares since he became chief executive 16 years ago, was a source of bitterness and cynicism for many GE workers. Welch said he was well paid and was benefitting from the labor of all GE's employees. He noted that stock options were now distributed to some 22,000 GE employees, as opposed to only 200 as recently as 1988. Big pay packages, including deferred compensation plans, were needed to retain top performers, Welch said. He said some top GE executives, such as the current head of AlliedSignal Inc. had left the company for more pay and broader opportunities. Welch, the latest U.S. chief executive to be criticized for high compensation, last year received $6.3 million in salary, $15.1 million from a long-term incentive program and $6.2 million by excercising options on GE stock. He was also paid almost $600,000 in benefits, such as life insurance, according to GE's proxy statement. Walt Disney Co. stockholders, including several leading institutional investors, two months ago challenged a 10-year pay package given Chairman Michael Eisner worth as much as $771 million. Twelve percent of Disney shares were voted against the Eisner pay package. One study said CEO pay rose about 20 percent in 1996 and 16 percent in 1995. ","MichaelConnor"

If you take Europe and the U.S. together, the market is worth about 100 billion pounds, of which only 30 billion is outsourced.""

"The Prague Stock Exchange, battered and bruised in 1996, should recover next year as officials implement plans to shore up confidence in the sagging bourse, analysts said. Many an analyst had predicted similar bullish fortunes for the bourse in 1996, only to be undermined by lack of commitment on the part of government officials to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency. But a new commitment from Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and bourse officials to clean up the market has once again triggered an optimistic outlook for the coming year. ""Because most foreign investors have such a poor view of this market, they are under-invested here,"" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. ""Once you start to create better conditions, you should see it translate into a strong positive trend next year,"" Sykora said. The bourse started 1996 with a bang, rising 36 percent over the first three quarters to put the PX50 index at a year-high of 582.0 in September. But it went out with a whimper as investors stepped up criticism of the lack of transparency in Czech markets and particularly of the failure of the Central Securites Registry (SCP) to release detailed price information. Most off-market trades are registered at the SCP. While smaller exchanges in Budapest and Warsaw built on earlier gains, the PX50 dropped by nearly a quarter to just above 500 points, a level where it continues to linger at. After months of decline, government officials finally threw their support behind the creation of an independent supervisory body for the market, but it will take months to develop it. Until then, the finance ministry is supposed to transfer its market oversight department into a separate office which will get more resources from the government to do its job. Until recently, Prime Minister Klaus had showed little enthusiasm for a plan by PSE chairman Tomas Jezek to create a body modelled on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Klaus has long believed market regulation, now conducted by the finance ministry, should be minimal. But he capitulated in mid-December saying an independent body was needed, and then surprisingly announced that all prices of OTC deals registered at the Securities Centre would be published from February 1. ""An absolute priority for 1997 is the creation of an SEC-type body,"" Jezek told Reuters. ""It is a positive step in the development of our market. I hope it will show our commitment to making the market more transparent."" Though it may not be a panacea to the market woes, analysts agree that the oversight commission would be the most important step the PSE could take in 1997. ""The lack of regulation was one of the main reasons for the bourse's fall and with improved market regulation, the stable political situation and good corporate earnings growth, the PSE should perform well,"" said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance. He added that Patria expects the PX50 index to rise by about 20 percent next year to ""around the 600 level"". But transparency is not the only issue that will effect the bourse in 1997, analysts say. Once the toast of post-Communist Europe's transformation process, the Czech economy has, like the market itself, underperformed this year. Growth in industrial production has slowed, compared with 1995, amid a broader slowing in GDP growth which stood at 4.0 percent year-on-year for the first three quarters, putting full year original estimates of 5.1 percent virtually out of reach. In addition, the central bank's constant struggle to keep inflation in check has pushed interest rates up sharply, cooling private consumption and hurting the bottom lines at many Czech firms. ""Investment costs have been significantly higher for a lot of companies, and we are seeing this eat into the bottom lines of smaller firms that can't raise money abroad,"" said one foreign analyst. But many blue chip firms such as telephone monopoly SPT Telecom have continued to invest heavily this year, and according to Anna Bosong, an Eastern European equities analysts at ING Barings, should show a marked improvement next year. She said that ING has forecast a contraction in earnings per share (EPS) of 4.9 percent for the Czech market in 1996, but sees a turnaround in 1997 to an increase of 10.9 percent. ""Czech firms have been investing heavily in improving capacity and basic infrastructure and this should come back to help in the coming year, improving earnings performance as well,"" she said.

"China has set realistic targets in its 1997 budget but analysts said on Sunday that debt-ridden state-owned enterprises and high unemployment remain thorns in the government's side. A 1997 budget deficit target of 57 billion yuan ($6.87 billion), was, at less than one percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a ""very healthy level and good for a developing country,"" said Hoong Yik-Luen, head of China research at ING-Barings. Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, in his budget report on Sunday, announced a 7.2 percent cut in the budget deficit from 61.442 billion yuan in 1996, which was itself 10.8 percent below target. ""Very few countries in the world today have a budget deficit around one percent of GDP,"" Hoong said. ""If you look at the United States, it is probably three to four percent, so they (China) are doing better in terms of budget deficit control than a lot of First World countries,"" he said. The government's use of domestic bond issues was a clever and thoughtful way of soaking up China's surplus cash for domestic investment, he said. China issued a total of 196.742 billion yuan in debt last year, 1.485 billion yuan above the targeted figure and an increase of 27 percent over 1995. The 1997 target for domestic and overseas debt announced by Finance Minister Liu is 248.596 billion yuan ($29.95 billion), up 27.3 percent on the 1996 figure. One analyst in Shanghai said government authorities ""are realising there is a lot of money domestically"" as bank deposits far outstripped bank loans. By issuing domestic bonds -- though minute in value compared to developed countries that issue domestic and international debt -- the government was able to soak liquidity back into the system. ""If you look at the fact that all the bond issues were sold to domestic investors, then basically it is not an external debt problem,"" Hoong said. ""It is actually recycling domestic savings and moving the money from people's hands, preventing them from spending and thereby accelerating inflation, and bringing that money back to the government,"" he said. ""Then the government relies on domestic savings to invest domestically."" Another analyst in Shanghai said one reason for the popularity of bonds was the lack of investment alternatives. ""One of the reasons that bank savings outstrip loans is because there is a lot of money in the system and people want to get some kind of return on it,"" she said. ""The other problem is that the lending rate is too low. The banks could be lending a lot more than they are and they could be doing it very productively if they were allowed to do their own lending,"" she said. This was due in part to China's tight credit policy of the past few years, she said. While credit would probably be eased in 1997, bank deregulation was not on Beijing's agenda, she said. Stability, however, was a top government priority, especially after the death last month of Deng Xiaoping, whose 18-year leadership steered China from Stalinist backwater to economic powerhouse, analysts said. After three years of belt-tightening aimed at slowing growth that threatened to spin out of control, China should now be concentrating on such pillars as infrastructure development to create jobs and kick-start the sluggish economy, they said. China's estimated 100,000 state firms reported their first ever combined net loss in the first quarter of last year, but a banking source said the economy's reliance on them has fallen from 100 percent before 1979 to around 40 percent now. The need to retrench up to 150 million people had been factored into the government's long-term economic policies, he said, and for the sake of stability could not be done overnight. ""It has to be done slowly,"" another of the bank analysts said. ""And we would prefer it to be slow because if it is too hasty it could result in some very unproductive mergers."" She and others put real national unemployment at close to 15 percent. The 1997 target for urban unemployment unveiled in Sunday's budget was three percent. China's official urban unemployment rate was 2.9 percent at the end of the third quarter of 1996, with no figure available for all of 1996. Officials have said the figure could be around seven percent. An inflation target of six percent for 1997 was realistic and achievable after 1996's 6.1 percent, Hoong of ING-Barings said. ""They have shown they feel comfortable with the inflation rate,"" he said. ""The question now is stability and stability will come if everyone has a job."" ","LynneO'Donnell"
"Russia's plans to cut electricity tariffs for good payers could jolt its giant aluminium industry, the world's largest exporter of the non-ferrous metal, into bigger profits, officials and analysts said on Monday. But not all plants, they said, would benefit equally. ""Well, this is certainly a pretty good development,"" said Galina Stelmakova, deputy director for development and investments at Kontsern Alyuminiy, the Russian producers' group. ""It will streamline the economic situations at smelters. Fuel and Energy Minister Boris Nemtsov, in charge of revamping natural monopolies in the energy and transport sectors, said earlier that electricity tariffs for domestic industry would drop by up to 30 percent from July. Nemtsov said only users which paid on time for supplies would be eligible for the lower tariffs -- a condition many, but not all, Russian smelters meet. Industry officials said that with electricity accounting for about 25 percent of the cost of producing a tonne of primary aluminium in Russia, lower power tariffs could help profits. Yuri Shlaifshtein, a board member at Bratsk, the world's largest primary aluminium smelter, said leaner tariffs could help the Siberian plant's longterm plans to attract foreign investment for modernisation. ""I can only welcome this decision,"" he said by telephone, adding Bratsk always paid on time, in cash, for its electricity supplies. ""This won't affect our general production levels but it will make them more stable over the longterm."" Russia, home to the world's largest smelters, exported 2.44 million tonnes of primary aluminium last year, the most of any producing country. Its total output was 2.87 million tonnes. The reduction in power costs are not likely to be felt evenly, since different regions have different rates. The so-called European part of Russia, where only about 15 percent of Russia's aluminium is produced, pays the highest tariffs. Irkutsk, another large East Siberian smelter, pays about 10 percent of its per-tonne production cost of $1,200 for electricity. In sharp contrast, the European smelters pay up to $600 for electricity for each tonne. Boris Arlyuk of St Petersburg, Russia-based Alumconsult said the rate cuts would help the Kandalaksha, Nadvoisky and Volgograd smelters in the European part of Russia most of all, since those plants had the highest energy costs. But they were also the least solvent, paying for electricity with metal or promissory notes, and might not be able to produce cash up front as Nemtsov wanted, he said. Russian smelters are struggling to secure longterm electricity supply contracts to increase profits and plan for the future. Nemstov's rate cuts are part of a wider drive by Moscow to spark life into industrial output in general, which has plummeted in the years since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Ironically, electricity rate cuts could benefit the Siberian smelters the least, since some of them may have already secured longterm supply contracts with regional hydroelectrical plants. ""Now if we can just get the government to agree to a lower tariff for three years,"" Shlaifshtein added. ""And then get it to do the same thing for railway tariffs."" Nemtsov, a young reformer who is also a first deputy prime minister, has also promised to cut rail tariffs -- a move the smelters would welcome. Industry officials have said the cost of transporting Russian metal to world markets is more than twice the Western industry average of around 24 percent. Kontsern Alyuminiy said in March that average Russian smelter profit margins had fallen to one percent in 1996 from 16 percent two years before. --Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520 ","LynnleyBrowning"
"A plan on how the Czech Republic will diversify natural gas supplies, now coming solely from Russia, has been delayed for several weeks, the Industry and Trade Ministry said on Tuesday. ""We are gathering information, analysing it, and it's going to take several weeks (before the issue is put before the government),"" ministry spokesman Miroslav Konvalina said. A plan had been expected to be submitted to the government sometime in January. Konvalina gave no reason for the delay. Officials have declined to say which partners the government was considering, though government representatives have held talks on limited deliveries from Norway. The ministry is drawing up plans for four options for securing gas supplies, but has given no details. No matter which plan is accepted, Russia is expected to remain the dominant supplier. It said the four options being considered are: - Purchasing all natural gas from Gazprom, using two different shipping routes, with a long-term agreement until 2016, with price guarantees until 1998. - Purchasing some Russian gas indirectly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and Germany's Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF AG. Gasunie would start supplies in 1998, delivering up to two billion cubic metres in 2005, with the agreement lasting until 2014. In case of a fall in Russian supplies, it would deliver its own gas through Wingas, a joint venture of Wintershall (65 percent) and Gazprom (35 percent). Wintershall offers a similar scheme, with deliveries starting on January 1 next year, rising to one billion cubic metres in 2000, under a deal until 2016. Negotiations with these firms are in the stage of initiating a supply contract. - Finalising and maintaining the agreement for Norwegian gas, which was given preliminary approval this year, until 2017. - A limited purchase from Mobil Europe Gas Inc, Germany's Brigitta Erdgas und Erdoel (BEB) and British Gas Plc . The Czechs have ended their dependance on Russian crude oil by building a new pipeline to Germany, but are still completely dependant on supplies provided by Russia's Gazprom. The Czech Republic consumes around eight to nine billion cubic metres of natural gas per year, but volumes are expected to rise to some 12-13 billion cubic metres by the turn of the century. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"China's President Jiang Zemin has emerged to rule China after seven years in waiting as heir apparent to Deng Xiaoping and, at 70, among his most pressing tasks will be to identify his own successor. Diplomats said finding an heir could be crucial for Jiang if he is to ward off attacks from ambitious younger men or from power-hungry elders who want to run the show from behind a bamboo curtain -- the means chosen by China's Empress Dowager 100 years ago. ""Jiang Zemin, who while Deng Xiaoping was alive was the young successor, has become at the moment of Deng's death the incumbent leader who is immediately faced with a succession crisis,"" said Australian Sinologist Geremie Barme. China's leadership has carefully displayed a united front since Deng died on Wednesday aged 92. China-watchers say this may be a facade. ""It'll be like a duck swimming -- on the surface it'll be calm but underneath it'll be turbulent,"" said one Chinese analyst, quoting a Chinese proverb. In imperial China, the transfer of the ""mandate of heaven"" to a new emperor was rarely smooth. While the latest power shift so far has been seamless, analysts said later upheavals could not be ruled out. Jiang must now confront his own mortality and fend off other aspirants to power, among them Qiao Shi, the former security tsar who now heads parliament, economic supremo Zhu Rongji and Premier Li Peng. He will also face assault on his authority from the last two surviving veterans of Deng's generation, former president Yang Shangkun, 89, and former head of parliament Peng Zhen, 95, whose communist credentials are second only to those of Deng. In a system where Deng held supreme power until he drew his last breath -- even though he retired from his last post in 1990 and never held a top job -- political pedigree and traditional respect for age rank high. Political acumen will be crucial. In the seven years since he was launched into China's top job, Jiang has toiled to make his position unassailable, battling to boost support while picking his way through the political minefield at the top of the party. Analysts say he certainly now ranks as first among equals in a society that finds itself without an all-powerful strongman for the first time this century, but he may have tried too hard. ""Unlike Deng Xiaoping, Jiang has shown himself to be an unwise political strategist for he has, in an unprecedented move in post-imperial Chinese history, claimed and maintained control of all three major arms of power,"" Barme said. ""It is strategically suicidal,"" he said. ""It is not wise to be front man in everything."" Analysts said the time may have come for Jiang, well above the official retirement age of 65, to act quickly. ""If he was a wise leader, he would quickly manoeuvre himself into a position where he could appoint a successor who could carry out his legacy -- just as Deng appointed a successor,"" Barme said. ""So Jiang is faced with the urgent task of devolving power to younger leaders, but may not have the wisdom to carry out such a strategic reformulation of his position"". Diplomats agreed that Jiang's amassing of top jobs could hurt rather than help his survival after Deng. His most immediate challenge comes from Premier Li Peng, who completes his second and final term next March, but whose future post must be decided, albeit in secret, at the crucial 15th Party Congress in October. Li wants another job. He wants to be president -- or better still head of the party -- and he can argue that Jiang should give up at least one of his jobs, Chinese political analysts say. But Jiang cannot afford to give up his job as head of the party, and doesn't want to stop being president. Therein lies the future power struggle. ""Jiang Zemin enjoys the trappings of power,"" said one Western diplomat. ""He likes the pomp and ceremony, the fanfare and red-carpet treatment. He likes to bask in the limelight. ""That is a reason why the Li Peng question is so problematic,"" he said. ""If Jiang were willing to give up the presidency then the retirement of Li Peng from the premiership would not create so many problems."" ","JaneMacartney"
"Its tough line unshaken by the death of leader Deng Xiaoping, China pressed ahead on Monday with a controversial plan to roll back political freedoms in Hong Kong, drawing a rebuke from colonial Governor Chris Patten. Deng, who died last week, was the architect of the ""one country two systems"" formula for the conversion of Hong Kong into a special, autonomous capitalist zone of China when British rule ends at midnight on June 30. Despite widespread misgivings about China in this bustling territory of 6.4 million people, thousands of residents paid their respects to Deng for the fourth day on Monday in a mourning ceremony at a shrine inside China's official mission. On Sunday night, China's parliament approved a plan to throw out or amend a clutch of Hong Kong laws, including those that provide for democratic elections and protect civil liberties. The plan trims back the bill of rights, the law on forming political parties and another on free association which takes a liberal approach to public protests and demonstrations. The laws were part of London's effort to sow the seeds of democracy in the twilight of more than 150 years of British rule. China has accused Britain of violating the 1984 Sino-British handover treaty. Patten accused China's National People's Congress of turning a deaf ear to the wishes of most Hong Kong people. ""(Sunday's decision) casts doubt on the freedoms and autonomy which have been promised to Hong Kong and the rule of law on which they are based... It will cause legal confusion and invite legal challenge,"" Patten said. ""It is already crystal clear that what the community wants to see is the preservation of Hong Kong's current civil liberties..."" Sunday's decision was also attacked by Hong Kong's Democratic Party, the largest in the territory's legislature. ""China's latest move means the die is now very much cast,"" a spokesman for the party told Reuters. ""China has shown it is not going to respect the will of Hong Kong people. The NPC is a political body making a decision that will remake Hong Kong in blatant breach of handover agreements which say Hong Kong's laws shall remain unchanged."" He said the move violated the internationally registered 1984 Sino-British handover treaty, called the Joint Declaration, and Hong Kong's future constitution, the Basic Law. Beijing's move to crimp basic freedoms flies in the face of official protests by Britain. London has challenged China to go to the World Court to seek a ruling on the legality of China's plan to replace Hong Kong's elected Legco with an appointed provisional legislature. In a related development, a leading Hong Kong member of the Preparatory Committee on the handover said Hong Kong would not be allowed to amend new election rules that his panel was preparing for the territory. Neither Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting, Tung Chee-hwa, the provisional legislature, nor the post-colonial government, could change the rules, Lau Siu-kai said. Slightly over half of Preparatory Committee members are from Hong Kong and the rest are from the mainland. Its decisions generally echo policy statements by senior Beijing officials. The rules would govern the first election of a long-term legislature some time in 1998 to replace a provisional body that China has appointed to make laws from July 1. ","PeterHumphrey"
"French books-to-missiles conglomerate Lagardere Groupe said on Tuesday it does not expect to make a profit on its ambitious multimedia activities until 1998, despite leading market positions in the U.S. and France. Arnaud Lagardere, the son of founder Jean-Luc Lagardere and the New York-based head of the multimedia (Grolier) activities, told a news conference that while the results were improving, there would still be a loss for 1996 and 1997. ""We will hit the break-even point during 1997 and 1998 will be the first full year that we will be above break-even,"" Lagardere said. ""In 1996 our contribution to the group will be slightly negative but it will be an improvement over the previous year,"" he added. Grolier, the number two interactive encyclopaedia publisher in the U.S. behind Microsoft and owner of Hachette and Filipacchi and titels such as Elle, is the largest content contributor to America Online in the U.S. It has annual sales of some 2.5 billion french francs ($448 million). Lagardere is also the owner of the Club Internet access provider which is number three in France behind CompuServe and AOL and has big ambitions for the Intranet market of closed web services for companies. ""1997 will be the year of the Intranet in Europe,"" Lagardere said, pointing out that while Europe was lagging behind the U.S. with only 22 percent of companies having such a service, the majority of companies was planning to start such a service. That is where the hardware people of Lagardere come in. Noel Forgeard, chairman of the Matra Defence Espace unit which is vying for state-owned Thomson-CSF, said the company would try to find investors and industrial partners for a multimedia satellite project targeted for 2005. Lagardere is already partner in the Orion satellite project and its MCNSAT service can provide high-capacity internet and multimedia transport for companies. The company is currently working on two projects, called ""TurboPC"" and ""West"", which would turn digital television sets into stand-alone internet computers. The TurboPC project envisages that computers can receive information from a satellite through a small dish -- like the ones to be used for digital satellite television. In the first instance, the so-called return line remains ""terrestial"" via a telephone line. With ""West"", a series of at least three satellites would allow computers to use the satellite for the return as well. Forgeard declined to speculate on the investments needed, saying these K-band satellites were not comparable to mobile telecommunication satellite projects such as IRIDIUM which plans to launch 66 low-orbit satellites and has raised $2.65 billion. Forgeard said Lagardere would need to find investors and telecommunications operators to participate in the project. ""It is far too premature to speculate about the investments needed,"" he said. Arnaud Lagardere added that while the project was ambitious the company would not engage in investments or take on risks that would ""put the group into danger"".

"Nynex Corp. has until Monday to respond to charges it acted in bad faith by not signing an agreement with MCI Communications Corp. that would have allowed the nation's No. 2 long-distance carrier to enter Nynex's local market in New York state. MCI filed a motion against Nynex on Monday asking the state Public Service Commission (PSC) to impose sanctions on Nynex for failing to sign the so-called interconnection agreement, which would enable MCI to provide local phone access in the state. On Wednesday, state Attorney General Dennis Vacco filed papers with the commission seeking to bar Nynex from offering long-distance service because it discriminates against local-service rivals. Vacco has been an outspoken critic of the proposed Bell Atlantic Corp. takeover of Nynex, and its New York Telephone operating unit, on anticompetitive grounds. Nynex operates 11.1 million local service lines while competitors have less than 100,000 local service lines, according to state regulators' estimates. Nynex spokesman Mark Marchand said the New York-based company strongly disagreed with Vacco's assessment of their draft application for long-distance service in New York. ""Fifty phone companies are licensed with the PSC to provide all forms of local phone service,"" Marchand said. ""What they do is up to them. The market is open. There is no other state in the country which has a more competitive market."" Nynex has signed full interconnection deals with competitive access providers, including MFS Communications, a unit of WorldCom Inc.; Teleport Communications Group Inc. and WinStar Communications Inc. The deals would allow the companies to route traffic over their own network switching equipment. In addition, Nynex has reached resale pacts with Frontier Corp., among others, to allow companies to offer local access over Nynex's network. Most of the new entrants into the New York local service market are focused on profitable niches in the business services market, rather than residential service. The dispute is part of a broad change across the United States due to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, under which local and long-distance providers are seeking to meet regulatory requirements that would allow them to compete on each other's historic turf. Washington-based MCI, which has waged an agressive campaign to enter local service markets, so far has reached five interconnection deals -- two in California, where Pacific Telesis and GTE Corp. operate, and with the respective Baby Bells in Georgia, Minnesota and Iowa.

"Sprint Corp is keeping its options open on how to extend its local phone services across the U.S. in the post-deregulation telephone environment, but for now its cable TV allies are not participating at all. Interviews with key Sprint executives this week show the long distance firm will begin by reselling the local circuits of regional Bells but longer term it is keeping an open mind. ""The relationship we have with the cable companies at this point is for wireless only (not local telephone),"" said Sprint chief operating officer Ronald LeMay. The wireless partnership, Sprint PCS, is shared by Sprint, Tele-Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and Cox Communications Inc. It is building a pure digital network across the U.S for Personal Communications Services. The extension of local phone service has been the most troublesome part of Sprint's 1994 grand strategy to package wireless and wired phone service with cable TV. Sprint and its partners have grown away from their original plans to use cable networks to carry telephone services to consumers. Sprint already has seven million local phone customers, mainly in rural and suburban areas, but is aiming for the center of big cities for its service expansion. ""We're shooting for somewhere between 10 and 20 cities served by end-1997,"" Wayne Peterson, president of Sprint's local communications division told Reuters. ""We are on the verge of several resale agreements (with regional Bells),"" Peterson said, adding that they expect some to be finalised within 30 days. The 1996 Telecommunications Act which breaks open the regional Bells local calling monopoly sets a process for new competitors to negotiate access to local customers over the Bells' network. Talks have moved very slowly. No resale deals between Bells and the big three long distance operators have yet passed all approval processes, and to speed the deals, Peterson said Sprint was willing to accept the same terms as MCI Communications Corp and AT&amp;T Corp where they had already struck provisional deals. However Peterson was looking forward to the day when Sprint would own its own switches -- the modern successors to telephone exchanges -- in all the areas where it provides local services, which would boost the investment returns. LeMay said the 1994 deal with the cable firms assumed it would be impractical to resell Bell networks nationally. ""Frankly at the same time the Telecom Act began to develop and it became clear that the ability to become a reseller or a rebrander...on a nationwide basis was much more feasible than we assumed when we entered the cable relationship,"" he said. In addition cash shortages at some cable partners and technical hurdles to upgrading cable networks for telephone services caused some cable companies to hesitate. There were also disgreements, with some cable companies wanting to keep the benefits of Internet and other broadband services over the cable TV system out of the alliance. ""One of the things we disagreed on was the extent to which we should share the benefits of high speed data,"" LeMay said. He said no talks with the cable partners were taking place, but added the door was open if any of the companies decided to make a ""real commitment"" to local telephony. LeMay said Sprint had no interest in buying or taking a stake in Teleport Communications Group Inc, even though it owns networks in precisely the urban areas where Sprint needs local customers. Teleport is majority owned by Sprint's cable partners and by U S West Media Group's Continental Cablevision. ""Basically it is in our view a commodity function, and we don't have an interest in investing in a commodity function,"" LeMay said, adding that he would be interested only in buying networks like Teleport's if it was cheaper than building or renting them. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610 ","NickLouth"
"The United States on Tuesday raised the stakes in a battle to supply NATO aspirants in central Europe with advanced fighter aircraft by offering the Czechs free use of seven Navy Hornet jets for five years. Representatives of the U.S. Navy, on behalf of the U.S. government, offered to lease the Czech Republic seven McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 ""Hornet"" fighter planes under a no-cost, five-year agreement, McDonnell Douglas Corp.said. Czech officials reacted warmly to the offer, saying the support of the U.S. government was welcome, but that it did not guarantee success for the bid. ""We welcome the U.S. government's support but we will look at all bids. We have experts who will examine all of them and investigate which is the best,"" said Petr Necas, chairman of the parliamentary defence committee after a meeting with U.S. Navy vice-admiral John Allen Lockard. On offer are six single-seat F/A-18A and one two-seat F/A-18B aircraft currently used by the U.S. Navy. The offer also includes the supply, at cost, of replacement parts, pilot and ground personnel training programmes and support equipment. ""Supply and service costs will be the subject of further discussions,"" a company statement said. ""The advantage of the lease is that it allows the Czechs to quickly obtain the Hornets, and they would gain almost immediate operational and maintenance experience with these aircraft,"" McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman Barbara Anderson told Reuters. ""As opposed to purchasing, they can take that experience and then make a more sound purchase decision later,"" she added. Also competing for post-Cold War business in central Europe are U.S. Lockheed Martin, which makes F-16s primarily for the U.S. Air Force, the Anglo-Swedish consortium of SAAB and British Aerospace,, which makes the Gripen, and France's Dassault Aviation makers of the Mirage. Necas expressed disappointment that governments from other competing countries had failed to step forward formally to lend their support, saying it appeared the U.S. was far more active in the pursuit of a contract. ""I have to say that it's too bad for the Czech side that the activity of the French, Swedish or British governments from the perspective of cooperating (with their companies)...isn't comparable with that of the U.S.,"" he said. The Czech government, seeking to prepare for eventual membership in NATO, has been debating whether to buy any aircraft as proposed cuts in defence spending have clouded the debate over the upgrading of the fleet. The Czechs, along with Poland and Hungary, are seen as leading candidates for early NATO membership, when the western security alliance expands. Czech defence officials have said they have the will but not the wallet to buy brand new Western-made advanced fighters, but are keeping their options open as a battle over the long-term military budget goes on. They have said they would need about 24 fighters to replace their ageing Soviet made MiG-21s to be more compatible with NATO, but at more than $20 million per fighter, new western planes are too pricey. Czech pilots could begin training in the planes in six months, with delivery of the aircraft 18 months after the contract is signed, the statement said. To strengthen its bid, McDonnell Douglas also said that it is preparing to locate component production for the Hornet at Czech Aero Vodochody a.s. regardless of whether new or leased aircraft are chosen to re-equip the Czech Air Force. Cooperation could also include Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s., the firm added. ","AlanCrosby"
"International business services group Rentokil Initial Plc announced sharp rises in 1996 sales and profits on Wednesday, but there were concerns that the group relied heavily on newly-acquired BET for progress. Rentokil Initial, formed last year through Rentokil's hostile takeover of rival BET, said pre-tax profit jumped 48 percent to 318 million pounds ($505.8 million) while sales were up 168 percent at 2.34 billion pounds. The dividend rose 20.5 percent to 5.06 pence per share. The results were at the bottom end of analysts' forecasts of between 317 and 335 million pounds, and shares in the company fell sharply in morning trading, trading down 5.7 percent or 26 1/2 pence to 431 1/2 pence. Rentokil Initial, whose services include office cleaning, personnel, security, pest control and supplying plants, also announced a two-for-one share split. It said the integration of BET, bought for 2.1 billion pounds, ""had proceeded rapidly and successfully in line with plans."" However, excluding BET, sales were up 15 percent and profits rose nine percent to 233.4 million pounds, raising concerns that the company would not have lived up to its long-established reputation for delivering year-on-year earnings and sales growth of 20 percent without BET. One trader said ""they managed the 20 percent gain, although the contribution from BET is very substantial. People will be asking about their core businesses and wondering whether they would have made the grade without BET."" The company said the results had been affected by 16.4 million pounds of integration costs, focusing of management effort on BET's integration and adverse exchange rates. Chief executive Sir Clive Thompson said he did not expect the company to make any more large acquisitions for the next two years while it integrated the 52 BET operations. ""I'd be very suprised to see us making major acquisitions for certainly under two years, and if we were to do so it would indicate that we had integrated the businesses extremely well,"" Thompson said. However, Thompson said there were opportunities for ""bolt-on acquisitions"" in the core businesses of hygiene and cleaning, pest control and security ""and I hope we'd be making those sorts of acquisitions."" Thompson said he expected to make a number of low-key disposals of BET operations over the next year. ""In the short term you'd expect to see a series, quite a number, of relatively small-sized disposals. In total terms over the next 12 months it might approach 50 to 100 million (pounds),"" he said.

"Indium, one of the few minor metals to survive the end of the Cold War with demand intact, is now in short supply as Chinese producers have either oversold or are hoarding stocks as prices soar, traders said on Friday. Traders in China and Japan, the world's biggest consumer of indium, said Chinese producers seemed unwilling to sell at current prices, instead waiting for further rises. Indium, a by-product of zinc, is used in the manufacture of semi-conductors and liquid crystal displays (LCD). China is Asia's biggest producer, according to one trading source. Japan uses about two-thirds of annual world supply, with 80 percent of that used to make LCDs, a Tokyo market source said. Japanese consumption slumped 38 percent in 1996 to 43.5 tonnes, pressuring on prices, he said. But with an improved economic outlook and a revival in the high-end electronics industry, indium demand is picking up and world supply is tightening. Figures for China's annual output are not available. One trader said it is not a major world supplier of indium but in a tight market its output counted. ""Chinese producers have sold out, in effect they have oversold, so I don't think we will see anything available before late April/early May,"" a Chinese trader in Beijing said. ""Chinese producers are now looking for $290 a kg,"" on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, he said. The price for 99.99 percent indium ingot was quoted in Rotterdam last week at $220/250 a kg. Chinese indium is arriving in Japan at $280-300 a kg, inclusive of cost, insurance and freight (CIF), the Tokyo trader said. Far East traders said they have been waiting for spot prices for indium to hit $300 a kg, as there was no perceptible pickup in Chinese production after the Lunar New Year holiday in February. A European source in Hong Kong said he recently bought a few hundred kg of indium in the belief that prices are on their way back up to the levels of two years ago, close to $500 a kg. ""The market has seen those levels before and is not afraid of them,"" he said. The Chinese trading source said that Chinese factories were now shipping against old contracts but were asking for a premium over the contracted price. Other traders said long-term contracts were being delayed, with some reporting that Chinese suppliers were attempting to re-negotiate prices. Some suppliers were also reneging, they said. ""We have had that experience,"" a source at a Western company said. ""So in this atmosphere people are very wary and we are still pushing for our own deliveries,"" he said. Another Chinese trader said there were sources of indium in China and Hong Kong but these were unlikely to seep into the market until prices firmed more dramatically. ""When the price rose to $400-500 a kg in 1995, a lot of Chinese companies were thinking it would go as high as $700 and they bought a lot of material at $400,"" the source said. ""Some of them are still holding, waiting for the price to go up again so they can clear their books,"" he said. ""So there is material and we will see some come out but there won't be a flood because producers have oversold, they will want to clear their old contracts first. ""In the meantime, there are a lot of people knocking on our door looking for indium,"" he said. ","LynneO'Donnell"
"Political controversy struck Hong Kong on Thursday when future leader Tung Chee-hwa lashed out at critics who tarnished Hong Kong's image, and Britain attacked China's plans to roll back democracy and human rights. ""Recently, some well-known people, including the Democratic Party, have blackened the reputation of Hong Kong overseas... giving the impression that Hong Kong is collapsing,"" Tung said. ""Is there the need to go abroad to blacken the name of Hong Kong? Is there the need for foreigners to come to Hong Kong and tell us, the Hong Kong people, what to do in the future?"" Tung told reporters as he opened offices that will be his base until Britain hands the colony back to China at midnight on June 30. The former shipping magnate's attack on those who ""talk down"" Hong Kong and frighten investors was directed primarily against Martin Lee, leader of the popular Democratic Party, which is campaigning against a new legislature appointed by China. Lee, rounding off a 10-city tour of Europe, told Hong Kong radio after hearing Tung's remarks that Tung must do more to defend the territory of 6.3 million people against Beijing's Communist rulers. ""We want Mr Tung to change the unhappy fate that awaits Hong Kong...talk to the Chinese leaders, get them to wind up that appointed illegal legislature. ""Then our worries will be over and overseas investors will be very happy to come to Hong Kong and invest more,"" Lee said. Tung said there were different views about the ""need for balance between individual rights and order in society"". ""But in future, I hope our friends will sit down here in Hong Kong and talk things through,"" said the post-colonial ""Chief Executive"", who was appointed by a China-controlled committee. British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who is in Singapore for talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and will visit Hong Kong this weekend, again condemned Beijing's plan to install a ""provisional legislature"" in place of Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council on July 1. He said it clashed with a 1984 handover treaty and with the constitution covering Hong Kong's handover. ""We believe the establishment of the provisional legislature certainly goes against the spirit and indeed may be a severe breach of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law."" The European Union's envoy in Hong Kong said negative press coverage of Hong Kong had created a misconceived ""doom and gloom"" scenario. ""This is a public relations disaster,"" envoy Etienne Reuter told reporters. ""They believe that after July 1 there will be no freedoms and human rights in Hong Kong."" The president of the shadow legislature, Rita Fan, sought to reassure Hong Kong people this week they had nothing to fear when the territory becomes a ""Special Administrative Region"" of China. Under the handover treaty, China has promised wide-ranging autonomy and 50 more years of freewheeling capitalism. ""To be fair to ourselves we should give ourselves a chance and stay put and see what happens,"" Fan told Reuters. ""I personally am very confident and convinced that we will have our lifestyle and our freedom as we have enjoyed all these years,"" she said. Tung said that in the next few days he would announce his team of top officials to head various policy branches, the equivalent of ministers in the government of a country. Speculation is intense on who will be kept from the present government. Tung has already said he will retain the head of the administration, Chief Secretary Anson Chan, a fellow-Shanghainese, who has agreed to stay on. But even after he has cobbled together a government-in-waiting, he faces enormous political challenges. His advisory cabinet, the Executive Council, which will meet in the offices he opened on Thursday, has been attacked by democrats as too pro-Beijing, and he is constantly assailed for unswervingly echoing China's autocratic, anti-democratic views. But on a more positive note, a Sino-British negotiating team hammering out details of the sovereignty transfer, announced on Thursday they were zeroing in on an accord on a 1997/98 budget for Hong Kong that would straddle the handover.

"The death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has had an impact in Hong Kong unseen since the 1976 passing of Mao Zedong, founder of communist China. But it pales in comparison to the outpouring of grief that followed Mao's death, long-term residents say. An estimated 50,000 people have visited China's official mission in Hong Kong, the Xinhua news agency building, to pay their respects at a Deng shrine in the five days since the Chinese patriarch's death last Wednesday. Some segments of the British-ruled community of 6.4 million people also saluted Deng with gestures of mourning at the moment of his official Beijing funeral on Tuesday. Ships blasted their horns, buses trailed black ribbons, train stations broadcast dirges, flags flew at half mast, and schoolchildren stood at attention in respectful silence. Deng, purged by Mao before becoming China's unquestioned leader in 1978, orchestrated China's opening to the West and its economic reforms, as well as Beijing's blueprint for taking back Hong Kong from Britain on July 1. Mao died in 1976 after a rule marked by numerous purges of the communist leadership and revolutionary upheavals climaxing in his disastrous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. Still, hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong mourned his passing, long-term residents said. ""With Mao, huge numbers of people poured into a hall crying. It was very mournful,"" said Hong Kong politician Elsie Tu. ""It brought tears to our eyes as we felt the end of an era,"" said the 83-year-old Tu, a former missionary in China. Long-term resident and former China-watcher John Dolfin said the turnout for Mao was massive and the salutes ear-splitting. ""The lines curled three abreast around the Bank of China building, and all through the park. There must have been thousands in the line at any given time. It took an hour and a half to get in,"" said Dolfin. ""The line was much smaller for Deng. It was very quick. And there wasn't much emotion,"" Dolfin said. ""For Mao every boat in the harbour stopped and blew their whistles. It was deafening. But today the harbour was virtually empty when the whistles were blown. ""Chairman Mao very much still held authority when he died, unlike Deng, who frankly was not really the 'paramount leader' for a number of years and held no official positions of power when he died,"" Dolfin said. Szeto Wah, a pro-democracy politician and critic of Beijing, recalled Mao's mammoth personality cult. ""The reaction for Mao was much stronger than for Deng because he was like a god. It was like the death of a god. All of China felt helpless,"" said Szeto. ""People went to mourn Mao at the Bank of China building. The atmosphere was very grievous but also very nervous because the Cultural Revolution had not yet finished,"" he said. ""An important difference was that there had not been any news about Mao's condition, whereas Deng's condition has been frequently reported before he died."" Arthur Hacker, a long-term Hong Kong resident and former government information officer, recalled 1976. ""They dismantled the enormous sign on the top of the Bank of China building which said 'Chairman Mao Lives Forever',"" he said. ""Everybody went to the Bank of China, opposite the old cricket club. Xinhua was very invisible in those days,"" Hacker said. ""There were wreaths all over the bank's wall, and queues of people. There were red flags all over the place."" ","PeterHumphrey"
"CSX Corp. raised the stakes in the bidding war for Conrail Inc. on Thursday, amending its friendly merger agreement with the railroad to give unhappy shareholders another $870 million and bringing the total value of its offer to $9.5 billion. Richmond, Va.-based CSX and Conrail of Philadelphia are battling with Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern Corp., which has bid $10 billion, or $110 per share in cash, for Conrail. Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's offer, contending that a transaction with CSX is a better fit. The new agreement would give Conrail shareholders another $16 per share, payable in CSX convertible preferred shares, as part of the stock portion of the cash and stock transaction. Based on Thursday trading in CSX shares, an industry analyst estimated the value of the new CSX-Conrail deal at $104 per share, or $9.5 billion. The value of the stock portion of the deal changes daily as the stocks of the companies rise and fall. ""In every respect this merger holds great potential and clearly offers the best result for Conrail. This amendment to the merger agreement reaffirms the decision of the Conrail board that it is not willing to agree to the sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern,"" Conrail Chairman David LeVan said in a statement. Norfolk Southern immediately indicated that it was not walking away from its hostile effort. Industry experts widely expect it to raise its bid soon. ""There should be no doubt that Norfolk Southern remains as determined as ever to acquire Conrail and will use any and all appropriate financial means to accomplish that objective,"" Norfolk Southern said in a statement. In a further enticement to investors, CSX and Conrail established a voting trust to accelerate payment to Conrail shareholders by 1997. Previously, shareholders would have not been paid until the transaction received required regulatory and other approvals. The establishment of the voting trust is likely to encourage some shareholders to tender their stock to CSX and exit the controversial transaction, experts said. One of the most controversial portions of the revised deal prohibits both CSX and Conrail from pursuing a merger with another company before the end of 1998. Shareholders, who had opposed the previous deadline of mid-1997 on the grounds that it prevented Conrail from considering a potentially higher offer, blasted the extension. Members of the investment community also expect Norfolk Southern to challenge the exclusivity period in court. An attorney for Norfolk Southern said legal action was probably forthcoming. Other aspects of the Conrail-CSX agreement are unchanged. They include $110 per share for 40 percent of the outstanding Conrail shares and 1.85619 shares of CSX common stock for each Conrail share. CSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in a cash tender offer at $110 per share and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent. Conrail also delayed a special shareholder meeting to Jan. 17 from Dec. 23, and CSX extended its tender offer to Jan. 22. At the meeting, shareholders are to consider a key provision that would effectively permit CSX to proceed with the acquisition. Many members of the investment community had predicted shareholders would defeat the provision. While the new terms were widely considered to be more attractive, Wall Street and industry sources said they may not be strong enough to clinch the deal. The new pact ""definitely doesn't lock it up because you've got to wait for Norfolk Southern to come back. It definitely makes it more attractive and more equitable across the board,"" said analyst Peter Gleason of Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder advisory firm that last week recommended investors defeat the provision at the special shareholder meeting. The proposed merger of Conrail and CSX, first announced Oct. 15, would create a giant that would dominate the rail freight industry on the East Coast. In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Conrail shares rose $1.875 to $100.875, CSX shares fell $1.25 to $44 and Norfolk Southern rose $2.25 to $88.50. ""The actions taken by the CSX and Conrail boards allow us to move on to the next stage of the process, the filing of our merger application with the (Surface Transportation Board),"" the federal regulatory agency overseeing railroads, said CSX Chairman John Snow. Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities noted that the deal was becoming less financially attractive to the prospective buyers as the bidding war continues. ""We're bumping up against the point at which this is getting pricey. It still makes some sense, but for CSX it's getting close,"" Hatch said, adding that Norfolk Southern can well afford to raise its offer. ","RobinSidel"
"General Motors Corp. said Tuesday its fourth quarter earnings fell by more than half as labour strife in the second half of the year cost it $700 million in profits. The world's largest automaker earned $786 million, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $1.59 billion, or $1.95 a share, in the 1995 fourth quarter. All figures exclude results from Electronic Data Systems Corp., which was spun off last June. Revenues fell to $40.95 billion from $41.35 billion. For all of 1996, GM earned $4.95 billion, or $6.06 a share, down from $6.03 billion, or $7.14 a share. Revenues for the year rose to $164.1 billion from $160.3 billion. Workers from the United Auto Workers union and Canadian Auto Workers union struck GM last fall after talks broke down on a new three-year contract. In March 1996, a UAW strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants crippled GM's North American production for more than two weeks. All told, GM said work stoppages in the United States and Canada reduced its full-year earnings by $1.2 billion on an after-tax basis. ""Clearly our 1996 fourth-quarter and calendar-year results were impacted by the strike-related production losses in the United States and Canada and are not indicative of GM's potential for continued profit improvement,"" GM Chairman John Smith said. The strikes also took a bite out of the 1996 profit sharing checks for GM's union workers. GM said 282,000 represented workers in the United States will receive about $300 each -- less than half of the $800 each received last year. GM said 76,000 eligible salaried workers will receive 1996 incentive payments, with payments rising with the level of pay and responsibility. By comparison, Chrysler Corp. announced last week its U.S. workers will each receive an average of $7,900 in profit sharing. GM's 1996 fourth quarter results included several one-time accounting items, including a $157 million loss on the sale of four Delphi parts plants to Peregrine Inc. and a $167 million charge for lump sum payments to UAW members as part of its new labour contract. Including the strike-related effects, the one-time items brought down GM's fourth quarter earnings by $762 million, or 99 cents a share. However, the fourth quarter also included a separate, favourable tax gain of $262 million. GM's North American operations, its core automotive group in the United States, had a net loss of $124 million vs. a profit of $603 million in the year-ago quarter. For the year, the North American unit, which includes Delphi Automotive Systems, earned $1.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion. The automaker's international operations reported net income of $353 million for the quarter, down from $498 million a year ago. For all of 1996, GM's international profits were $1.5 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 1995. Worldwide car and truck deliveries from GM dealers for the quarter were 1.9 million units vs. 2.02 million a year earlier. That reduced the automaker's worldwide market share to 15.5 percent for the quarter from 17.3 percent. GM's U.S. market share also fell, to 30.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 33.5 percent a year ago. Unit deliveries in the United States were 1.08 million down from 1.20 million. In his statement, Smith also blamed the lower 1996 results on production changeovers, higher advertising and ""consumer-influence"" expenses related to new-product launches. The average U.S. retail incentive for the fourth quarter was $739 a vehicle, up from $518. ""We have more new cars and trucks going into the market now than any time in the last 15 years,"" he said. ""In fact, about 20 percent of the 1997 production will be for the new models launched in 1996. Those new cars and trucks are key to our plans to aggressively increase market share in the United States this year."" GM stock was down $1 at $60.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ","ToddNissen"
"China's first and only non-state bank, the China Minsheng Banking Corp, is planning major growth in 1997 but will always be a niche player beside the country's huge state banks, a senior official said on Thursday. Minsheng was founded in Beijing a year ago, opened Shanghai and Guangzhou branches last month, and plans to open branches in at least six other Chinese cities over the next 12 months, Shanghai branch manager Lu Jiashan said. ""The plan is to set up branches in Shenzhen, Dalian, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu and either Qingdao or Jinan. If it's completed, the scale of the bank by the end of 1997 will be quite significant,"" Lu said in an interview. But he said the bank's ambitious growth plans posed no threat to the state banks that dominate the country's banking sector. ""We will grow fast, but we are in a weak position compared to the state banks, we're no threat to them at all,"" he said. ""The private banks will always be small players."" The Minsheng Bank is an anomaly in China's tightly controlled banking system. The bank doesn't seem to quite rate the title ""private"", but it has 59 shareholders, mostly private Chinese firms including the Hope Group, a feed grain producer based in Sichuan province, and the Xiamen Fuxun Group based in Fujian province. Lu said that the bank had complete freedom to make loans, in terms of both recipients and amounts, a huge difference from the state banks who have strict loan quotas they must stick to, and instructions on how much they must lend state enterprises. ""All our loans are based purely on commercial considerations, there are no quotas, no administrative interference in the loan process at all. There are also no policy loan responsibilities,"" he said. Lu said the central bank viewed the Minsheng Bank as an experiment. ""Whether there will be more non-state banks or not is not for me to answer, but one thing we can be sure of is that there will be a lot more banks in China in the future, and many of them will be share-based companies,"" he said. The bank announced a small profit of 11 million yuan for its first year of operations and already has more than seven billion yuan in assets, Lu said. ""We have been open in Shanghai for only 18 days, but we already have assets of one billion yuan, which is much better than my expectations. We have 150 to 160 enterprises that have opened accounts with us,"" he said. He said the bank's target was to triple the assets of the Shanghai branch to three billion yuan by the end of 1997 and open several branch offices around the city. The bank's main focus, he said, would eventually be loans to private companies, although at this point only 10 percent of its customers are private firms with state enterprises and listed companies making up the lion's share. ""In the past, it has not been so easy for private firms to get banking support,"" Lu said. ""Now there is a bank specialising in this sector, helping them with their businesses, which I am sure will give a boost to the economy as a whole."" He said the branch had so far made 12 loans of which three were to private companies. ""There are risks involved, and we need to make the right choice of companies that will promote the market economy as a whole, so we don't invest blindly,"" he said. ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"Former NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff was named chairman of the board of America Online Inc.'s original content division, Greenhouse Networks, the online giant announced Monday. The world's No. 1 online service also said it was buying LightSpeed Media, a pioneer producer of Internet soap operas and shows. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. As part of the deal, Vienna, Va.-based Greenhouse Networks said it would develop an interactive entertainment network, slated for launch this fall. The entertainment network will be based in Los Angeles and will capitalise on Lightspeed's and Tartikoff's relationships in the entertainment industry. America Online's deal with Tartikoff expands a previous arrangement announced last fall for the executive to develop original interactive brands to be launched simultaneously online, on television and as books. Tartikoff, who was president of NBC Entertainment from 1980 to 1991, currently heads his own television and production company, H. Beale Co., in Los Angeles. Tartikoff will continue to head his own production company and act as a consultant and adviser to America Online as chairman of Greenhouse, America Online said. LightSpeed was behind the first so-called ""episodic"" show on the Internet, called ""The Spot,"" which it sold to American Cybercast early last year. ""The Spot,"" an interactive soap opera about five people sharing a house on a California beach, is still on the Web site of American Cybercast, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January. LightSpeed was founded in May 1996 by the creators of ""The Spot"" after American Cybercast bought the programme. Founder Scott Zakarin will be named president of programming. Zakarin and his team launched another Internet soap -- -- ""GrapeJam"" -- last August. America Online executives said Internet soap operas will be only one small part of its broad entertainment network, which will feature celebrity hosts, live events, news and other information about the entertainment industry. ""The focus (of the network) is on the entertainment industry and the entertainment business,"" said Greenhouse President Danny Krifcher. He declined to say how big the venture will be. America Online plans to make money from the entertainment network through advertising revenues, licensing and through transactions, such as selling tickets to entertainment events, selling merchandise and offering premium information at a surcharge. But Krifcher declined to make any forecasts. The closest competition America Online said it has on the Internet to the entertainment network are sites such as Mr. Showbiz, E! Online and a People magazine site devoted to entertainment. ""This is a very big opportunity,"" Krifcher said. ""This is the beginning of what we think will be a series of exciting announcements and developments for us."" America Online stock rose $3 to $45 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ","TheresePoletti"
"Lloyd's of London on Friday posted profits of over one billion pounds ($1.6 billion) for the second year running -- but warned that profits would fall for at least the next two years. The insurance market, which last year only just succeeded in pushing through a rescue package after the billions of pounds of losses run up between 1988 and 1992, also said its future focus would be on customers. ""For too long, Lloyd's has been obsessed with its capital base. We need to get back to basics,"" said Chief executive Ron Sandler. That meant providing customers with the best service and developing international trading opportunities, he said. Lloyd's results are reported three years in arrears and for 1994, profits once again topped the billion pound mark at 1.01 billion pounds. That fell just short of 1993's record level of 1.08 billion pounds and was in line with forecasts. Corporate members, who were introduced to the market in 1994 following the near-disastrous losses which threatened to sink Lloyd's, will share in today's profits for the first time. Corporate capital now provides some 44 percent of the market's capacity, a figure that is forecast to increase further in the future. Sandler described the 1994 results as ""extremely satisfactory"" but said that there was no sign of an end to the downward trend in premium rates. That decline, a product of competition in insurance markets worldwide, is expected to have a significant impact on profits in the next few years. An aggregate of individual syndicate forecasts suggests profits will fall to around 900 million pounds in 1995 and 600 million in 1996. The 1995 figure is ahead of projections made this time last year despite the adverse movement in currencies but the slide in rates is expected to take its toll in subsequent years. Lloyd's chairman Sir David Rowland admitted 1997 results would be under pressure from the decline and said he hoped brokers would ""sit on their hands when offered business at crazy rates"". The 1994 figures were a result of generally good market conditions and the exercise of much sharpened skills in pricing and the setting of terms by Lloyd's underwriters, he said. They were also helped because of fewer catastrophes, he added, though currency effects reduced profits by around 100 million pounds. Lloyd's returned to profit 12 months ago following five years of record losses totalling more than eight billion pounds. Those losses were reinsured into a separate company, Equitas, a central plank in Lloyd's ""reconstruction and renewal"" plan which ensured the 300-year old insurance market's survival. The reinsurance of 1992 and prior liabilities had transformed Lloyd's position, Sandler said, and clients could be confident that Lloyd's security ranked alongside the best in the world. Final proposals for further strengthening the market's financial security which will include increasing the amount of capital that Names -- the traditional backers of the market -- have to put up to back their underwriting, are expected to be published next week. Lloyd's is continuing its efforts to recover around 600 million pounds of debts owed by Names who have refused to meet their losses. Rowland said it was impossible to give an estimate of how much Lloyd's thought it could collect, but said it would be a substantial sum of money. Litigation in the U.S. and Britain was unlikely to prove problematic and the amount recovered would depend ultimately on the assets of the Names involved, he added.

"Oil giant British Petroleum Co Plc is involved in a ""conspiracy of silence"" over human rights abuses in eastern Colombia, European legislator Richard Howitt alleged on Friday. But the British Labor Party representative to the Euro- Parliament admitted, after a week-long fact-finding mission to the country, that he had no evidence directly linking the multinational to the deaths of social leaders in Casanare province close to BP's operations. BP's Colombian subsidiary, British Petroleum Exploration (BPX), has consistently denied charges of links to rights abuses committed by right-wing paramilitaries and the army. In a statement issued on Friday, it ""energetically"" condemned all violations carried out against civic leaders in the area. ""BP is involved in a conspiracy of silence and should take a more active stance in favor of human rights ... it may be that BP staff have a direct liability in these actions or it may not be the case,"" Howitt, a member of the Euro-Parliament South American affairs delegation, told a news conference. ""But I find it impossible to believe that BP managers are not aware of these human rights abuses committed in their name if not by them directly,"" he added. The claims against BP were fueled by a series of articles in the British press in the last year based on a multi-agency report drawn up in 1995. That report documented the murders of seven peasant or social leaders, most of whom had protested against BP's operations in the area since they began in 1991. BP is not mentioned by name in the report's conclusions, and the killings were attributed to paramilitaries and the army. A statement issued by BP Thursday said: ""BP rejects energetically human rights abuses from whatever quarter and has publicly condemned the deaths of civic leaders and others in Casanare."" ""BP categorically rejects the accusations made by Howitt. He has a great responsibility to make sure that these claims are fully founded,"" it added. BPX head John Doust asked Colombia's Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso to investigate the claims fully to show it had nothing to hide. Valdivieso opened an inquiry last month but told Doust in a letter that he had no grounds to suspect any wrongdoing by the British company. Howitt also accused BP of failing to spend enough on the local community in Casanare. BP figures show it spent more than $17 million between 1991 and 1996 on social, education, education, environmental and infrastructure programs. ","KarlPenhaul"
"China and the United States signed a new textile agreement on Sunday in an eleventh-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and was hailed by both sides as a breakthrough. U.S. officials said their main achievement was gaining assured access for the first time to Chinese textile markets, adding that it also granted China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact. Millions of dollars in penalties slapped by Washington on Chinese imports remained in force under the deal, although Beijing had agreed to withdraw its threat of retaliation, top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said after the signing. ""For the first time the United States has market access with China...and this is something we felt very strongly about,"" Hayes told reporters. ""It is now a situation that we have a level playing field."" The four-year textile accord was signed by Hayes and Li Dongsheng, China's chief negotiator and director of the trade management department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. Officials of both sides welcomed the deal, which was hammered out during negotiations that ran far beyond their original three-day schedule to become a gruelling six-day marathon topped by all-night sessions. ""After six days of hard work, the delegations have reached a rather ideal conclusion,"" said Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, who attended the signing ceremony. Officials of both sides declined to give details of the accord, but Hayes said it would create U.S. jobs by allowing exports while slightly increasing China's U.S. import quota. The talks focused on renewal of the 1994 textile accord and resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, with market access for U.S. goods to China also a major stumbling block, officials said. Breakthrough came during a one-day extension to the final deadline for renewal of the Sino-U.S. accord, which had originally been scheduled to expire on Dec. 31 but was extended by one month to allow time to reach a compromise. ""I think this morning at the beginning we were unhappy with each other, but now we have become friends,"" U.S. negotiator Li told Hayes during the signing of the accord. The accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions. China had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but delayed the action to allow time for further talks. After the signing of the textile accord, Beijing announced it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but U.S. negotiator Hayes said Washington's penalties remained in force. ""The transshipment charges that were made in September still stand as they did,"" she said without elaborating. Access to China's huge and growing markets was also an issue in other Sino-U.S. meetings in Beijing last week. U.S. trade official Lee Sands held two days of talks in the Chinese capital to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of bilateral friction. ""The agreement is once again proof that China and the United States can settle their trade disputes through negotiations based on equality and mutual benefits,"" said negotiator Li. ","MureDickie"
"Australian steel-maker The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) on Tuesday announced the closure of Australia's oldest steel-making plant, an industrial icon which it said could no longer match its Asian competitors. The Newcastle mill, a milestone in the nation's industrial development when it opened in 1915, will shut down its blast furnaces by the end of 1999 as part of a major overhaul of BHP's global steel business, the company said. BHP chief executive John Prescott, who like his predecessors forged his early career at Newcastle, was unsentimental in announcing the closure, which will end 2,500 workers' jobs. ""The fundamental purpose of all the change is to ensure a viable industry going forward,"" Prescott told reporters. ""We are not walking away from the steel industry,"" he added. BHP now faces possible industrial action from trade unions, one of which said the closure would directly and indirectly destroy up to 12,000 jobs Australia wide. A mass meeting of Newcastle workers at the site, north of Sydney, next Friday is expected to consider calling a strike against BHP, an Australian Workers Union (AWU) official said. The AWU's Newcastle secretary, Mauri Rudd, told Reuters that a strike, if called, would try to block BHP exports. BHP, Australia's biggest company, is also Australia's biggest exporter of coal and a major exporter of Australian iron ore, liquefied natural gas and manganese. The Newcastle plant, at the foot of the coal-rich Hunter Valley, was opened in World War One as the first big step toward downstream processing of Australia's vast mineral resources. The Australian government described the decison to end steel-making at Newcastle as disappointing. New South Wales state Premier Bob Carr went further. ""To lose such a chunk of steelmaking capacity is tragic, not just for the workers but for this country and its capacity to make things,"" Carr told reporters after the announcement. But investors applauded the decision, sending BHP shares sharply higher and buoying the broader Australian market. BHP shares closed on Tuesday at the day's high of A$17.87, up 49 cents or 2.7 percent on Monday's close. The announcement of Newcastle's demise as a steel-maker was buried in a company statement outlining BHP's goal to move away from the weakest parts of steel business to its strengths. The statements followed a year-long review of BHP's position in the rapidly changing global steel business. BHP Steel aims to slash well over A$500 million from its cost base. The review identified BHP Steel's strengths as downstream steel products for use in offshore construction and car-making industries, especially in Asia and the Pacific Rim. Newcastle's rod and bar mills will be retained and developed into the centre for BHP's rod, bar and wire business. BHP's Geelong rod mill and Sydney wire mill will also close in 1999. BHP Steel chief executive Ron McNeilly made it clear that in the business of raw steel-making, BHP lagging behind its chief East Asian competitor, South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Co. Pohang has already achieved the industry's productivity benchmark of 1,000 tonnes per worker per year, while Taiwan's China Steel Corp aims to match this by year 2000, he said. ","MarkBendeich"
"Regulators Tuesday began auctioning a slice of spectrum that will let users gain access to the Internet over the airwaves or create wireless local phone networks that compete with traditional wired networks. Twenty-four companies -- including units of BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, Comcast Corp. and a Bell Atlantic Corp./Nynex Corp. joint venture -- are bidding for the rights to offer ""wireless communications service,"" or WCS. The first day of bidding in the multi-day sale totaled $5.3 million. Analysts said recent financial problems among wireless carriers will put downward pressure on prices. It is the Federal Communication Commission's 14th airwave sale. ""I expect prices to go very low for this type of spectrum,"" said Elliott Hamilton, analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm. The FCC is auctioning 128 licenses. Of that total, 104 are 10 megahertz licenses that roughly cover state-wide areas. The remaining 24 permits are for 5 MHz of spectrum and cover larger regional areas. The FCC is not dictating what services companies can offer over this portion of the spectrum. Potential applications include broadband wireless access to the Internet, wireless local phone networks, and location services for pinpointing trucks and other vehicles. The value of wireless spectrum has fallen after last year's $10.2 billion auction of licenses for a new generation of cellular phones known as ""personal communications services,"" or PCS. Edward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine, said FCC officials ""should be ecstatic"" if the agency can net $2 billion from the lastest auction. Several top bidders at the PCS sale are under financial strain after bidding high prices. Wall Street has been reluctant to invest in the ventures. Also, FCC officials doubt wireless service providers can offer anytime soon the kind of mobile phone service available through PCS. FCC officials cite restrictions on the use of the wireless service airwaves that are meant to prevent interference among users of an upcoming digital radio service that will be broadcast coast-to-coast via satellite. The wireless service and digital radio airwaves are adjacent to one another. The FCC has raised some $23 billion through its airwave sales. But the financial problems among last year's PCS winners has raised doubts over whether the government will ever collect all the money it is owed. PAC.N ","RogerFillion"
"A widespread shake-up is hitting the highly competitive funds management industry, stripping a number of Hong Kong's key players of their jobs. ""The whole industry is in turmoil at the moment,"" said Christopher Day, formerly of Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. Day left Thornton in the wake of its amalgamation last November into the other fund units of Dresdner Bank, including RCM Capital and Kleinwort Benson Investment. He is one of at least four senior dismissals during the past few weeks, according to industry sources. All were the result of consolidation in the industry with finance houses scrambling for position in the exploding mass market for retail mutual and pension funds. ""A number of companies want to become the Proctor &amp; Gamble of fund management,"" Day said. ""Virtually every European bank thinks it'll play in this market."" Big financial companies are merging, seeking distribution networks powerful enough to gain dominance in this sector. The best example was Morgan Stanley Group Inc's US$10.7 billion merger with Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co last February, he said. ""Dean Witter is a distributor, although it may not be called that,"" Day said. ""Branding and distribution are the key. Marks &amp; Spencer sells mutual funds, so does Virgin "" Banks are keenly interested in funds management because they want to shift income away from loans to investment management income, which they perceive as higher quality, said another senior industry figure who was about to leave his company. ""And there's growing income from fund management where on the loan side you increase profits by driving volume,"" he said. But he warned that banking and funds management do not necessarily blend well due to a difference in cultures. ""A loan-driven bank in Europe just does not have the entrepreneurial flair to drive fund management volumes, and in banks, nobody has any skill to manage these egotists,"" he said. This sort of culture clash could jeopardise compliance, he warned. Fund managers, often seen as unmanageable by the more conservative banks, end up being left alone while compliance officers -- usually lawyers -- have a poor understanding of the fund industry. Some fund managers also said they were becoming uncomfortable in the new supermarket-style fund houses, and this was one factor that accounted for a mushrooming of niche operations. Fund managers were under pressure to design mass market products and have assumed more of a marketing role to adapt to an increasing focus on the consumer. ""Small boutiques are rising up full of people (fed) up with the large houses,"" said the second fund manager The boutiques seem to function well. Joseph Paul, customer service manager at Rothschild Asset Management Asia Pacific, said his group has little interest in the high-turnover, mass market best exemplified by Jardine Fleming Unit Trusts in Hong Kong. But Rothschild proved that even niche players are not immune to fall-out from this industry shake-up. In late 1995, Rothschild lost its entire funds management team to National Westminster Bank, which merged one of its units with Wheelock and Co Ltd The merger folded last November, with NatWest buying out Wheelock's stake, partly because NatWest had sealed a deal with huge British pension giant Gartmore Plc -- Hong Kong Newsroom (2843 6470) ","SarahDavison"
"Amazon.com Inc., an online bookseller, is one of the best-known retailers on the Internet but faces a harsh investment climate and tough competition as it plunges into the stock market, industry analysts said Tuesday. The rapidly growing Seattle-based company filed documents on Monday to sell about 10 percent of the company in an offering projected to raise up to $33 million. That gives the company a market value of about $300 million despite a reported net loss of $5.8 million last year on sales of only $15.7 million. While Amazon.com long has been considered a likely candidate for a public offering, some analysts were surprised by the timing, noting that technology stocks in general and Internet startups in particular have been hammered in recent months. Some analysts speculated that Amazon.com decided to jump in now because of rising competition from bookselling giants Borders Group Inc. and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc., among others. ""I certainly think it's possible it came sooner rather than later because of the entry of those other players into that market,"" said Scott Smith, director of the digital commerce group at Jupiter Communications. The competition already has sparked a price war, forcing Amazon.com to offer its 500 top titles at a 40 percent discount to list price, slashing its slim profit margins. Smith and other analysts give Amazon.com high marks for identifying and exploiting a niche that seems particularly appropriate for online commerce. ""They can definitely make money at this,"" said Bill Bass, an analyst with Forrester Research. ""The interesting thing will be to see how much of the market they'll be able to capture."" Amazon.com advertises itself as ""Earth's Largest Bookstore"" with an ""inventory"" of virtually all 1.5 million English-language books in print plus about 1 million out-of-print books, compared with about 200,000 titles at a typical superstore. In fact Amazon.com keeps no more than a few thousand books on hand at its Seattle warehouse at any time, relying on its relationships with major distributors and publishers to order titles as needed and keep overhead low. Jeff Bezos, the 33-year-old founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, said the secret to the company's success was its ability to develop strong relationships with customers. ""We are incredibly customer-obsessed,"" Bezos said Tuesday at PC Forum, a high-level industry conference in Tucson, Ariz. ""The Web is really primitive at this point,"" he said. ""You have to make every customer an evangelist."" The company's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said repeat customers account for more than 40 percent of its business. ""I think it's absolutely possible to make money on the Web,"" Bezos said, while declining to comment specifically on the company's financial results. ""You can sell products at lower prices and have higher margins with much lower overhead."" But Manesh Shah, publisher of IPO Maven, said the market has not been kind to Internet stocks since last summer, when momentum began shifting to large-capitalization issues. ""The market has been very negative on small-cap IPOs,"" he said. ""I think they are hoping sometime between now and the end of the summer they get a window to get in."" Well-known Internet startups such as CNET Inc. and Yahoo Inc. have swung wildly, while Wired Ventures was forced to withdraw its planned offering due to a lack of interest. Yahoo, which has never matched its peak of $43 a share attained on its first day of trading last year, currently trades around $28. CNET has fallen from as high as $35.75 this year to $24.50 Tuesday. Even mighty Microsoft Corp. has seen its stock price slip 12 percent in recent weeks. ""Overall the sentiment is quite negative,"" Shah said. ","MartinWolk"
"African coffee ministers meet on Thursday to discuss cutting robusta exports following a January agreement among world producers, but some officials say disease and drought make cuts unnecessary in some countries. African producers agreed after a January meeting of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries to cut robusta exports by a total of 850,000 60-kilo bags between January and June 1997 in an attempt to force up prices. Individual country quotas were left to be decided later. ""We shall be looking into the export programme in light of the Rio (de Janeiro) agreement and our objective is to ensure a transparent and effective implementation,"" said a spokesman for the Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO). ""The ministers will take a decision on how to allocate the share which falls on Africa and how to deal with shortfalls,"" said IACO chief economist Donald Kaberuka. ""We will also discuss the issue of non-member countries."" Eight countries will take part in the talks -- Uganda, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Kenya, Zaire, Tanzania, Madagascar and Ethiopia. Quotas for individual countries set at the meeting would not be made public. ""Some people have said we will not make any cuts but that is not true,"" said Kaberuka. A Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) official said this week that drought and disease had cut into that country's exports, making quotas unnecessary. Uganda is Africa's largest robusta producer. It produced around 4,644,397 60-kilo bags in 1996 against 3,079,261 in 1995, according to IACO. Ivory Coast produced 2,526,198 and 2,493,754 over the same periods. Analysts in Ivory Coast say bean quality problems could mean no more than 130,000-150,000 tonnes will be exported in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) despite an official forecast of 230,000 tonnes. Ivorian exports by the end of January totalled little more than 24,000 tonnes. The season opened on November 14. The Coffee Board of Kenya, also citing drought and disease, has forecast a drop in production and earnings this year. Zaire's production has been cut by the conflict there since late 1996.

"Tomkins Plc, the British baking-to-engineering combine, reported a sharp surge in half year profits on Monday but snuffed out hopes of a share buyback this year by flagging possible acquisitions instead. Pretax profits for the six months to November 2 rose 34 percent to 168.8 million pounds ($284 million). The dividend rose to 3.06 pence from 2.7 pence the preceding year. Executive chairman Gregory Hutchings said the results marked ""another period of outperformance for Tomkins"" and forecast the the shares should continue to outperform the sector. Hutchings ruled out the possibility of returning the company's 366 million pound cash-pile to shareholders this year, saying in an interview: ""We see sufficient (acquisition) opportunities to hold onto our cash for the time being."" Hutchings said the group was likely to make a number of smaller buys. ""It won't be one major deal, but it could be worth up to 200 million pounds,"" he said. Rumours of a buyback in 1997 have helped push Tomkins shares ahead in recent weeks. Its shares on Monday reversed early gains, however, and were down four at 273-1/2p by 1115 GMT. ""The numbers were at the top end of what people were looking for and we've seen some early interest,"" one market-maker said. Analysts had expected profits of around 160 million pounds. The outlook was also seen as promising. ""Prospects for the second half look encouraging, with the majority of our operations having healthy order books and satisfactory market conditions,"" Hutchings said. He said Tomkins was delighted with its purchase last year of U.S. automotive and industrial product firm Gates Corp for $1.1 billion. Gates contributed 259.5 million in sales and 20 million in profit in its first 14 weeks under Tomkins control. A divisional breakdown of the Tompkins figures showed fluid controls had sales of 189.2 million versus 165.7 million pounds, with profits of 19 million versus 15.8 million. Industry services saw sales rise to 219 million from 194 million, with profits of 12.5 million versus 12.1 million. Professional garden and leisure products saw sales of 276 million versus 271 million and profits down to 8.5 million from 8.9 million. Industrial products sales rose to 317.3 million from 267.9 million, with profits of 34.3 million versus 28.5 million. Milling and baking, which includes the Hovis bread brand, saw sales up to 351.3 million versus 333.8 million, with profits at 15.4 million versus 13.7 million. Food products, including Bisto gravy and Robertson's jam range, saw sales up to 543.5 million from 501.8 million, with profits at 42.6 million versus 38.5 million. Excluding currency effects, organic growth in group operating profit was up more than 10 percent on sales, which in turn rose by seven percent. Unlike other major export groups, Tomkins has so far been left unscathed by the pound powering ahead against the dollar and mark. Against the dollar, Tomkins said it was locked at $1.52 to the pound for the rest of the year. The amount of mark-denominated business was minimal, it said. On market conditions, Tomkins said the U.S. was seen remaining firm. Britain was described as mixed, while the French market was expected to continue to suffer due to economic problems.

"Residents of a town in China's restive northwestern Xinjiang returned to work on Wednesday from the Lunar New Year holiday with officials vowing to deal a blow to separatism after a riot that left 10 people dead. ""The mayor...warned everyone to heighten their vigilance,"" Zhang Youlian, deputy director of the foreign affairs office of the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, said by telephone. ""We are resolved to deal a blow to the handful of ethnic separatist elements,"" Zhang told Reuters. Police had arrested between 200 and 300 people in the crackdown following the riot, officials said. About 1,000 people from the Uighur ethnic minority rioted in the town of Yining in Yili prefecture last Wednesday in one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang for several years. Paramilitary People's Armed Police only succeeded in dispersing the rioters, who smashed and burned cars and looted shops, a day later, a spokesman for the Xinjiang regional government said by telephone from Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital. The riot left 10 people dead and 144 wounded, he said. All the victims were Han Chinese, another official said. The death toll could rise, with up to seven people listed as missing, said one official in Yining. Of the wounded, 132 were civilians while the remaining 12 were members of the paramilitary armed police. Local residents returned to work on Wednesday after the five-day Lunar New Year holidays, which ended on Tuesday, but an after-dark curfew remained in parts of the town and armed police still patrolled the streets, Zhang said. ""We resumed work today...Basically, it's normal,"" he said. Authorities had sealed off the town, but planned to reopen the airport on Friday, Zhang said. Last week, demonstrators hurling rocks and bricks rampaged through the town, attacking Han Chinese on sight and setting fire to to about 20 vehicles. Armed police fired teargas to disperse the crowd. Several leaders of the riot had been arrested, the regional government spokesman said, adding that a manhunt for other rioters was under way. The leader of an exiled nationalist Uighur group in Kazakhstan said hundreds of Uighurs had been arrested following the riot. Yusupbek Mukhlisi, leader of the Almaty-based United National Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan, said the riot was sparked by the execution of 30 Uighurs by Chinese authorities last week. Zhang dismissed the report as a rumour. Yining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live. The riot was among the most violent for many years in Xinjiang, where Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population. Xinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing. Last May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's lengthy border to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states. ","BenjaminKangLim"
"Wilt disease killing Zaire's coffee trees surfaced three years ago, but a revolt in the east has hampered efforts to study and control it, a state coffee board official said. Christian Feruzi, Commercial Director of the Zairean Coffee Office (OZACAF), told Reuters in an interview that production and export data since war started in October was limited and contradictory.   No coffee from rebel-controlled eastern regions was included in export data, he said, adding that about 10,000 tonnes of coffee was exported from October to December 1996 from the west. ""IACO (Interafrican Coffee Organisation) and Zaire are carrying out a study to see how much of our production is recoverable but the war is handicapping efforts,"" Feruzi said in the interview at an African coffee meeting in Ivory Coast.   Rebels under Laurent Kabila, who has vowed to topple Zaire's veteran president Mobutu Sese Seko, control much of the east and are poised to attack Kisangani, Zaire's third largest city. Feruzi said coffee exports made up 15 percent of Zaire's export revenue before the war, after copper and diamonds. ""Where Kabila is in command we cannot get production estimations for the east. We are completely cut off from people on the ground,"" he added.   Most arabica is grown around the eastern town of Goma and in remote eastern hills in North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda. Lesser amounts are grown in South Kivu. Robusta is grown throughout Zaire, except in mineral-rich Shaba region in the south. Feruzi said wilt disease or Tracheomycosis surfaced up to three years ago but had already cut into production volumes.   ""Before the war the Office du Cafe took intiatives to stamp out the disease by uprooting trees, burning and replanting new stock,"" he said. ""The ICO (International Coffee Organisation) is studying a request we made for help with the programme and we are hoping for a reply soon."" Feruzi said output was growing before the war. Coffee production totalled about 100,000 tonnes in 1995/96 (Oct/Sept). ""Only 60,000 tonnes was exportable,"" he said. ""About 55 percent of our coffee came from eastern regions (now occupied by rebels) and 45 percent from Western areas (still in Zairean government hands),"" he added.   Export data from January 1997 were not available. ""About 10,000 tonnes of western regional coffee was exported from October to December 1996, mainly from Boma and Matadi ports."" Feruzi said exports were strongest from October to December with June to August exports higher than January to June. OZACAF said in January rebels in the east were trying to legitimise export procedures, adding that a lack of security for buyers meant most coffee would probably be smuggled abroad.   ""Exports are escaping all official state agencies,"" Feruzi said, citing Uganda and other neighbours as likely exit points. Uganda, Africa's largest coffee producer and another wilt sufferer, said smuggling did not show up in trade data. ""The quantities are negligeable,"" Uganda Coffee Development Authority Secretary-General William Naggaga told Reuters. ""Our figures do not show a lot of smuggling,"" he said in Abidjan.   Uganda had no role in selling its coffee but did monitor quality at export warehouses, he said. Zaire coffee usually goes to western ports by road or rail. ""We do not know how many trucks and trains have been trapped but supply routes have all been cut. Farmers are most likely not selling except in remote areas,"" said Feruzi. Some of Zaire's estimated 30 state-approved exporters, some with operations in both eastern and western areas, had fled to western Zaire, said Feruzi. Numbers were not clear.   Zaire last week agreed a new export limit for its les busy January to June period. African producers met in Ivory Coast last week to share out a 850,000 bags export cut agreed at an Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) meeting in Brazil in January. Zaire was allocated 7.86 percent (66,180 bags) of the cut. ""Zaire has agreed to limit coffee exports to 331,000 bags (20,000 tonnes) between January and June (1997),"" said Feruzi. OZACAF comes under Zaire's umbrella coffee policy unit, the Commission Mercuriale de Prix de Cafe, which groups ministerial, customs, banking, quality and other functions.

"Russia's net grain harvest will probably fall below official forecasts of 75-77 million tonnes, leading independent industry sources in Moscow said on Monday. Andrei Sizov of private agricultural consultancy SovEcon Ltd said he had revised his forecast down to about 68 million tonnes from a previous 70 million. ""Russia lost 2.9 million hectares to drought, and since it will cost more to harvest this grain than it is worth, it is likely this area will not be harvested at all,"" he said, adding that the government would be unwilling to spend money on tractor fuel for crops that were essentially already lost. ""The Western Siberian harvest is mixed -- you've still got good quality there for the time being, but it's a very slow harvest,"" Sizov said, adding that he saw output there at 9.3 million tonnes. He said it was likely the region would not be fully harvested and that some crops would be left to rot. However, a senior Western grains source said the government would probably declare the net grain harvest at 72 million tonnes, but that it could in reality turn out to be several million tonnes higher. ""They'll declare 72, but remember that they've under-reported the actual total for the last two years,"" the source said. A lot would depend on how heavy rains in Siberia affect yields, the source said, adding, ""Some of this stuff is not going to be of very good quality."" A source at the State Meteorological Service said government officials were constantly revising their estimates based on recent weather trends but that they were not making the new forecasts public. An Agriculture Ministry spokeswoman said the ministry was sticking to its forecast of 75-77 million tonnes but said officials would meet Thursday to discuss the pace of the harvest and that the forecast could be revised downwards. A source at Rosselkhozakademiya, the state agricultural institute, said the harvest would be slightly below the government forecast, but he declined to give a concrete figure. ""It will be a little bit below 75 million tonnes, because it's a very tough harvest in Siberia,"" said the source, who declined to be named. Arkady Blyumin, head of Informzerno, a grain market research group, said output could be as a low as 70 million tonnes or as high as 75 million. ""Nature may give us something, or it may take it away, and that's where the difference will be,"" he said. The Centre for Economic Trends, an influential institute set up by the government, on Friday forecast Russia's 1996 net grain harvest at 69 million tonnes. One analyst who saw output higher was Boris Chernyakov, head of agriculture at the U.S.-Canada Institute in Moscow. He forecast net grain output at 80 million tonnes, saying producers were hiding how much they had already harvested. Last year's grain output was officially 63.4 million tonnes, the worst in three decades. The harvest in parts of Siberia has largely ground to a halt as heavy rains keep crops too wet for reaping, while drought hit sections of the main grain producing areas in the Northern Caucasus and Central Russia earlier in the summer. --Moscow Newsroom +7095 941 8520 ","LynnleyBrowning"
"China's stock markets began returning to normal on Friday with all indices closing up in steady trade after the negative impact of the death of Deng Xiaoping faded from view, analysts said. Retail investors and institutions began building positions reflecting the sentiment that Deng's death would actually benefit the markets in the longer term by removing a major negative factor, they said. At the close on Friday, Shanghai's foreign currency B share index rose 0.894 points, or 1.38 percent, to 65.569 points while the domestic A share index closed at a year high of 1,063.276, rising 55.545 points, or 5.51 percent. In Shenzhen, the B share index rose 7.43 points, or 5.18 percent, to 150.96 and the A share index zigzagged up 8.68 points, or 2.48 percent, to 359.28. ""Trading has returned to normal,"" said one Shanghai trader. ""Investors don't believe there will be any major policy change after Deng's death."" ""Some investors believe Deng's death will benefit the markets by removing a major negative factor for good,"" he said. ""The bad news has been digested,"" a Shenzhen-based analyst with Central-South Securities said. ""The Shanghai stock market performed well because investors can see a smooth leadership transition taking place."" ""People feel today that there is a stable political transition and the government is gaining credibility,"" another Shenzhen analyst said. ""Medium and long-term investors are beginning to pour in funds."" Shanghai brokers said securities houses in the city convened meetings on Thursday which agreed on the necessity to keep the markets moving normally, but decided not to intervene to support the markets. But some analysts said they suspected the markets were in one way or another receiving support from institutions under instructions to ensure no major market movements in the aftermath of Deng's death. ""I still think there may be some government support in this,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. ""The official intention is to ensure that normalcy is maintained."" Analysts said the relatively short mourning period before Deng's funeral on Tuesday indicated China wanted to dispel the gloom as quickly as possible, helping to creating favourable investment conditions. ""The stock markets in China are very sensitive to political conditions,"" said another Shanghai trader. ""The impression that China is on the right track towards a smooth transition has helped the markets to recover swiftly."" Other brokers have warned that there was still potential for market volatility in the short term. ""I will have to wait until the end of the mourning period to see clearly where the market is heading,"" the Shenzhen-based analyst said. ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"iStar internet inc's new chief executive Craig Wallace said on Wednesday that the Internet service provider would post a reduced third-quarter loss on Friday, following a heavy second-quarter loss. ""Earnings will be in better shape than Q2 and will even be better in Q4,"" Wallace told Reuters in an interview. iStar's net losses widened to C$10.5 million or C$0.50 a share in the second quarter ended November 30 from a first-quarter loss of C$8.1 million or C$0.43 a share. It did not give previous year comparisons because aquisitions changed the firm's make-up. Wallace, who took the helm in January after joining the company last June, declined to elaborate. Before moving to iStar he was director of marketing at Microsoft Canada Inc. Analysts and investors have been less optimistic. One analyst, who declined to be identified, noted that iStar has not posted a profitable quarter since going public in November 1995 and said the performance could not get much worse. iStar's shares have tumbled as low as 2.06 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after soaring to 22 at their opening in late 1995. On Wednesday they slipped 0.15 to 2.55. Last year iStar was busy snapping up Internet providers across Canada, but the company has now shifted its focus to providing Intranet software solutions for corporations. The Ottawa-based firm, which has about 65,000 personal and corporate subscribers across Canada, is now concentrating on growing revenue and containing costs, Wallace said. Soon after Wallace took over from founder Rainer Paduch, who became chief technology officer, iStar chopped about 20 percent of its staff, or 45 employees. The lay-offs cut C$500,000 from iStar's monthly expenses and came on top of 100 layoffs last year. Wallace said revenue will rise but costs will fluctuate instead of increasing as iStar's infrastructure is already in place. ""We have significant improvement in our gross margin percent in Q3 and it will only get better in Q4,"" he said, again declining to elaborate. He forecast that iStar will reach profitability in fiscal 1998. However, the analyst disagreed, citing a lack of credibility on the street. ""It doesn't really matter what their margins are,"" he said. ""If they do manage to get their act together, it'll be too late."" Wallace said iStar is not actively seeking new acquisitions, but he would be willing to have discussions with any firm. He dismissed past rumors that iStar might merge with rival HookUp Communication Corp. Wallace also brushed aside suggestions that iStar could be swallowed by larger companies, saying that he believed iStar would emerge on top from a consolidation in the industry.

"Microsoft Corp is expected to show a sharp 40 percent jump in quarterly earnings Thursday on strength of the software giant's core business including the latest upgrade to its best-selling Office suite. On average analysts expect the Redmond, Wash.-based company to post earnings of $0.64 a share for its fiscal third quarter, compared with $0.44 a year ago after adjusting for a split, according to First Call.   Several analysts predicted revenues in the range of $2.9 billion, up about 32 percent from last year's $2.2 billion and up from $2.68 billion in the December quarter. ""I think on balance it will be a very good quarter,"" said David Readerman, analyst at Montgomery Securities. ""I don't see any motivating factor why they should blow the number out."" In January, Microsoft launched Office 97, the latest version of its ""productivity"" applications such as word processing and spreadsheets that accounted for an estimated $2 billion of the company's $8.7 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues.   Microsoft makes the bulk of its money from ""platforms"" including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers, which generate about third of the company's revenues. But analysts said the fastest-growing driver of revenue continues to be the high-end Windows NT operating system and related products for back-end computer servers. Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs estimated that Microsoft's BackOffice business, including NT, would be up 100 percent over the year-earlier quarter and represent about 20 percent of total revenues.   Analysts expect results from the current fourth quarter to be similar to the third, but Microsoft has warned that growth is likely to slow in the fiscal year that begins July 1. ""I do expect them to reiterate that fiscal '98 will represent a period of slower growth for the company,"" Sherlund said. While Microsoft is still benefiting from a mix shift to its more lucrative Windows 95 and Windows NT systems, analysts said it was not clear how planned updates to the products next year would affect revenues. ""They're being very cryptic on pricing,"" said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie. He said Microsoft had delayed release of the products in part because corporate customers were becoming confused by the proliferation of Windows flavors. Nevertheless, McAdams estimated Microsoft's revenues in fiscal 1998 would rise 27 percent to $13.7 billion. ""The markets they're playing in could double the size of the company,"" he said.

"Stagecoach Plc, the star performer of Britain's transport sector whose shares soared 138 percent in a year, promised on Friday more bumper growth this year fuelled by acquisitions overseas. Outlining its strategy for 1997, executive chairman Brian Souter said the Scottish-based buses-to-railways group had not run out of steam and still could deliver growing returns. He also tried to dampen concern about the size of group debt, with total gearing at 567 percent, saying it still had the financial scope to remain a deal-maker. ""We are very comfortable about our gearing levels. We would be in a position to make a major European acquisition in the next year if needed,"" he told Reuters in an interview. The fast-growing group is set to target rail and bus firms in the Nordic region as well as examining the Pacific Rim. Stagecoach, which started as a brother and sister team running the local bus company in Perth, Scotland, is now Britain's biggest transport operator having acquired privatised railway operations in southwest England, a rolling stock company and bus operations in England and Sweden. On buying market share in the British bus market -- Stagecoach has 17 percent with the aim of reaching 25 percent -- Souter said he wanted to wait until the election due by May, which the opposition Labour Party is strongly-placed to win. ""We are holding back on these deals because of the prices,"" he said. ""Once the Labour (Party) is in place and we know their policies, then we can move. But for now we have a sabbatical on acquisitions in this area."" On debt, he said: ""This gearing question is an important one which we want to address with the market."" The 567 percent gearing includes securitised debt and falls to 197 percent once securitised loans are stripped out. Stagecoach expects to have 230 million pounds in free cash in two to three years and stressed that 70 percent of its current 830 million ($1.36 billion) of total debt, including securitised loans, was fixed for seven years at 7.19 percent. The Porterbrook UK rolling stock unit could turn in 50 percent of group profit, say analysts, a figure the company does not argue with. ""It has exceeded our initial expectations and we continue to be very happy with it,"" said Souter. ""We are very comfortable with forecasts analysts are making."" Souter said the performance of the shares, which rocketed from 274 pence in December 1995 to the current level of 799-1/2, reflected the quality of underlying earnings. Stagecoach said it ran all its businesses against a ""worst case scenario"" set of conditions: a market slump, interest rates hiked to 15 percent and an eight percent fall in passenger traffic. Souter said all businesses remained viable. ""I'm not saying our business is risk or recession free but these are great quality earnings."" ""Political and regulatory uncertainty are the only worries, but we're not as uncomfortable as we were six months ago."" There are longer-term concerns about earnings once its South West Trains passenger rail franchise ends in 2003 and the termination of some Porterbrook train leasing deals around the same time. That would strip out a chunk of guaranteed earnings. But for the nearer term, the bonanza looks set to keep running, with analysts predicting average year profits to April 30 at 98.2 million pounds, rising to 154 million thereafter. Its last set of annual profits were 43.6 million. That growth will stem from Porterbrook and Swebus. One analyst said: ""Last year it was the best stock in the transport sector, so there can't be enormous upside left. ""But Mr Souter does have quite a big fan club in the City. He has very good business judgement and he's a specialist at investing in high-growth businesses sold off by the government at the wrong price."" ($1=.6119 Pound) ","EdnaFernandes"
"Four and a half thousand workers at U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co's Halewood plant in England face judgement day on Thursday when the management will meet unions to discuss the future, amid reports of 1,500 jobs cuts or full plant closure. A report on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) news service said late on Wednesday that Ford was set to announce the axing of 1,500 jobs at Thursday's meeting. But a spokesman from Ford refused to comment on the rising tide of speculation about the plant's future. ""Ford has issued no statement to the press on a reduction in the workforce or restructuring of any plants in Britain,"" said the spokesman on Wednesday. A statement is due from the company at midday on Thursday. The unions involved, led by the Transport and General Workers Union, will hold a press briefing at the plant. But the unions also said late on Wednesday that they were unaware of any confirmation of job cuts from Ford ahead of the make-or-break meeting. Ford's group boss Alex Trotman warned last year the group planned to take draconian action to end heavy losses in Europe and British newspaper have reported in recent days that Ford threatened to close the Halewood plant in northwest England unless new productivity targets were met. Britain's Observer newspaper said Ford planned to tell unions unless they agreed to more efficient working practices and 500 job losses the entire plant faced possible closure. But last Sunday Ford said in Detroit it would restructure but not close Halewood, with some job losses expected. TGWU head of communications, Andrew Murray, said it all hinged on the future of Ford's new Escort model. The next Escort version is due in 1999 and will be the first car engineered under Ford's new global product development structure called ""Ford 2000"". Analysts said it was unlikely Ford would take the drastic measure of closing down a plant and axing all 5,000 jobs. But Halewood is seen by some to be one of the least productive Ford plants in Europe. Arthur Maher, head of European forecasting at LMC International, said: ""Ford 2000 is about taking cost out of the organisation and reducing the number of (assembly) platforms. ""Europe is a big black hole for Ford in terms of money it's losing. It has too much capacity and the costs are above the levels they should be. Maybe Ford wants to try and extract further productivity improvements in return for some job security. I think that's where they are really coming from."" Industry observers believe manufacturing of the new Escort could be switched to Ford's other plants in Spain or Germany. ","EdnaFernandes"
"Computer, give me $20 bucks. Such a demand enters the realm of possibility with the introduction Monday of a device that turns a personal computer into an automated-teller machine capable of dispensing card-based electronic cash, marking a new step in PC-based home banking. Fischer International Systems Corp said its $60 device can be inserted into the floppy disk drive of any PC, enabling it to read ""smart cards,"" a new type of plastic credit-card that can perform electronic cash transactions and store bank account balances.   Already gaining popularity in Europe to pay for store purchases and streetside telephone calls, the ""smart card"" is beginning to take hold in the United States as a replacement for cash used in ordinary purchases like grocery shopping. By enabling PCs to securely dispense money, the device may provide a major stimulus to home banking by empowering consumers to perform financial transactions that now require a visit to a bank branch or an automated teller machine. ""What's been missing is a low-cost, easy-to-use 'bridge' between smart cards and personal computers,"" Fischer President and Chief Executive Michael Battaglia said.   Smarty, as the product is known, is a slim piece of hardware that inserts into a personal computer's 3.5 inch floppy disk reader, allowing the machine to link via the Internet to banks or retail outlets. The product is unique because Fischer holds key patents for smart card readers inserted into 3.5 inch floppy drives -- making Smarty the most readily adaptable card reader for the 200 million personal computers now in use, company officials said.   The device, which can be inserted into home or office personal computers or into a laptop computer when traveling, will enable consumers to make wider use of banking cards for purchases, replacing the need to carry loose bills and coins. As such, the product could be a boon to PC-based home banking, permitting full-scale transactions instead of the more limited functions now available, like electronic balancing of checkbooks, financial investment tracking or tax return filing.   Fischer officials said they are working with several major U.S. and European financial services firms to spur use of the devices in a variety of business and consumer applications, including home banking over the Internet. In addition, Art Burton, Fischer's vice president of sales and marketing said the company is in talks with top providers of home banking software like Intuit Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to link Smarty to their software. ""We have had some discussions at various stages with the primary providers of home banking software,"" Burton said. ""We are also working with individual banks.""   Burton said the PC-based Smarty product will be offered later this year to consumers participating in a trial of smart card technology on the Upper West Side of New York City by a group led by MasterCard, Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank. In addition, Fischer said it has received initial Smarty orders from the Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, for pilot testing by bank employees. Orders for demonstration models have also come from the U.S.-based credit card consortium Visa, U.K.-based Mondex International and Sweden's Telia Group.   Smart cards contain an embedded microchip capable of storing more than four million bytes of computer data, or dozens of pages of information -- far more than existing magnetic-strip credit cards that hold just 40 characters or so. The new financial data format can act as a one-stop shopping card storing electronic cash, a collection of credit cards, and other personal information including several forms of identification to prevent fraud.   While slow to catch on in the United States, smart cards have grown popular in Europe and Asia, where millions are now used by banks and credit card concerns as a means of storing digital cash, by phone companies as long-distance calling cards, or in healthcare to carry details of an individual's medical history. Fischer, with annual revenues of about $20 million, is solely owned by Addison Fischer, its chairman and a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   Addison Fischer is considered one of the world's leading experts on computer security. He was one of the founders and principal owners of RSA Data Security Inc, developers of a popular computer security encryption technique. Fischer and his two partners recently sold RSA to publicly-held Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. in return for $200 million in Security Dynamics stock.   Fischer faces many larger competitors in the smart card reader market, including France's Gemplus, U.S.-based Schlumberger Ltd and VeriFone Inc ;, Germany' Siemens AG and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands. But these rival machines take the form of bulky computer attachments or standalone-terminals priced between $80 and $300. By contrast, Fischer's floppy-insert method will be priced at $60 initially, with prices expected to fall below $40 as volumes increase in the coming year, making it an affordable option for consumers, Burton said. Asked if the company may be considering an initial public stock offering, Burton said that, ""It is firmly in our plans, but we are talking long-term -- within the next year -- not short-range."" He said Fischer plans to make another major product announcement in the spring of a related computer security technology before it decides whether to move ahead with any possible sale of the company's shares to the public.

"Beijing's young people jostled and barged their way into the Chinese capital's Catholic churches late on Christmas Eve, saying that for one night a year midnight mass was the place to be seen. Fashionably-dressed young men and women stood on their seats in St Joseph's church in the downtown Wangfujing shopping district to watch the mass, while regular church-goers fled outside for refuge from the crowd. Around 10,000 people were expected to visit St Joseph's throughout the evening, with more than 1,000 cramming into the church for the Chinese-language midnight mass, staff said. Only a small fraction of the visitors crowding into the Chinese-language mass and buying crucifixes or battery-powered musical Santa Claus dolls at the church shop were Christians, said congregation members. ""There are very few devotees here,"" said one worshipper in her 70s who said she was a daily visitor to the twin-domed church, which was established in 1655 by an Italian priest. ""They are all non-believers -- they don't understand this at all, they just think it's good entertainment,"" said the worshipper, who declined to be identified. ""I just came for fun,"" agreed one young visitor. ""I don't believe in God. In Beijing it is fashionable at the moment to come to church at Christmas."" Groups of affluent young men and women in their sharpest outfits lent the normally solemn church grounds an air more akin to that of one of Beijing's mushrooming nightclubs. ""Everyone was lined up, you know, just like at a disco dance,"" said one U.S. visitor. Hours before midnight mass, hundreds of mostly youthful onlookers strolled among the wooden pillars of St Joseph's, which was last rebuilt in 1905 after a devastating fire. Seminarians of the official communist-controlled Chinese Catholic church, known as the Patriotic Catholic Association, handed out religious tracts. Beijing has an estimated 70,000 Catholics, out of about four million nationwide. All are banned from acknowledging the spiritual leadership of the Vatican, with which China has no formal relations. Just round the corner from St Joseph's in the upmarket Taiwan Hotel a more commercially-oriented Christmas was on offer, with special menus, festive trees and a choir to greet guests with seasonal songs. Christmas was catching on in China, said the youthful Santa Claus posted outside the hotel's main restaurant to serve up good cheer to potential diners. But for this Beijing Santa, karaoke was a more important festive ingredient than roast turkey or crackers. ""I'll be at this until midnight,"" he said. ""Then I think I'll head next door to sing a few songs."" While few of the young church visitors to St Joseph's admitted to any deep religious feelings, hospital worker He Haiying said the visit to mass had other more secular benefits. ""It's a chance to have an exchange with Western culture,"" she said. While the influx of young pleasure-seekers was a clear sign of the more open approach to Christianity that has largely replaced the official hostility of the past, regular church-goers felt the crowds were a mixed blessing. ""There are too many people, there's no place to sit,"" said the 70-something St Joseph's parishioner. ""We older people will come back in the morning for the six a.m. mass."" ","MureDickie"
"Bre-X Minerals Ltd., Canada's hottest junior mining company, has officially started its hunt for a partner to develop its spectacular Indonesian gold discovery. The Calgary-based company said on Thursday it has hired international investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co. as its financial adviser and Republic National Bank of New York as its corporate adviser. ""This is the first step in finding a joint venture partner,"" a company spokesman said in an interview. ""We've hired J.P. Morgan and the Republic National Bank to evaluate our options."" Bre-X said it wants to find a big, experienced mining concern to buy 25 percent of the Busang gold property and help Bre-X to develop and market the deposit. ""Every major mining company in the world, quite literally, has expressed interest in working with us on Busang,"" said the spokesman. ""So pick the biggest mining companies in the world. If you want names, RTZ, Barrick, Placer Dome, all the way to some of the South African companies to Australian companies, you name it,"" he added. The company said it hopes to have a deal sewn up by the end of the year and start production in late 1998 or 1999. The global gold mining community has been holding its breath for months, waiting for Bre-X to open up bidding for its prized Busang deposit. The choice of J.P. Morgan as an adviser ""reflects that this is going to be a large international process,"" Gordon Capital analyst Barry Allan said in an interview. ""Everyone is interested. The question is who can afford it."" Buying a chunk of Bre-X will not be cheap. With the company's stock hovering around C$25 ($18.25), it has a market capitalisation of about C$5.9 billion ($4.3 billion) fully diluted. Bre-X shares, which soared from from a penny stock to more than C$160 ($116) before a 10-for-one stock split last spring, is expected to climb higher, pushing up the price tag for a 25 percent stake in the deposit. The decision on a financial adviser is only the first of a slew of announcements expected from Bre-X this month that could drive the stock. An Indonesian government contract is expected within weeks, which will outline environmental, social, tax and financial obligations for Bre-X and its Indonesian partner. While details of the draft contract of work are already public, some observers fear the government may try to grab a bigger share of the profits as they see the deposit blossom. New drilling results are also expected to hit the market within a couple of weeks, Bre-X said. Both the contract of work and the drilling results will likely send the stock higher, analysts said. For now, drilling at the Busang deposit has outlined 46.92 million ounces of gold. The next set of drill results should bump up the deposit to more than 50 million, analysts say. ""I've made the joke that everybody who goes to the property tends to see God,"" Gordon Capital analyst Allan said just days after returning from an analysts' trip to the site. ""And I guess I did. There's every probability it will be one of the largest in the world."" The mine should be low cost, especially in the first years, said Allan, with operating costs around US$150 an ounce. He has set a target of $35 for the stock, in the middle of the C$30 to C$40 range set by most analysts after the most recent tour and a previous tour in July. ""I continue to be really impressed by the deposit,"" said analyst Chris Bradbrook at Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon, who has visited the site twice.  ""It keeps getting bigger and bigger. The upside is substantial."" Bradbrook has a C$30 target for the stock for now, since investors want to see who the company's partner will be and how the partner will develop the property before they bid up the stock. ""That is the biggest potential driver."" But Allan said Bre-X's options in developing the site include going it alone. ""They don't want to sell too low and give up some of the upside potential,"" he said. ""I'm sure they'll look at those offers and if they don't find any that are reasonable, I suspect they will go on their own."" The economics of the project are robust enough for Bre-X to finance the mine itself, he added. Bre-X said it would consider that option too. ","HeatherScoffield"
"A dispute over the future of civil liberties in Hong Kong moved into the diplomatic realm with Britain and the United States warning China to respect a treaty pledge to preserve basic freedoms. The quarrel flared after a Beijing-controlled panel last Sunday proposed scrapping Hong Kong laws on civil liberties and elections, including part of its Bill of Rights, when China takes over Britain's last important colony five months from now. London and Washington issued stern warnings to Beijing, while China declared it was an internal affair and Hong Kong's future leader attempted to dampen the dispute. The controversy is the latest over Chinese plans to scrap liberal political arrangements that Britain has introduced in Hong Kong in recent years. China is also moving to install an appointed provisional legislature in place of the elected Legislative Council on July 1, and to block a lenient British law that would exclude China-style crackdowns on peaceful dissent and protests. China's opponents say these steps fly in the face of commitments on allowing Hong Kong to keep its freedoms after it becomes a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. The United States said on Tuesday it was deeply concerned about attempts to water down civil liberties in Hong Kong, and it called for reconsideration. ""We are deeply concerned over any attempt to weaken civil liberties and basic freedoms in Hong Kong,"" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. Hong Kong's post-colonial leader, Tung Chee-hwa, who takes over from Governor Chris Patten on July 1, called for calm. ""I think we are being too dramatic,"" Tung told Hong Kong radio. ""It is a very complex issue,"" he said, adding that he would make a fuller statement on the affair on Thursday. Britain's minister for Hong Kong, Jeremy Hanley, summoned the Chinese ambassador in London to protest. A Foreign Office spokesman said the proposals were without justification. He said the Bill of Rights was consistent both with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which is the treaty governing Hong Kong's handover, and with the Basic Law, the territory's post-handover constitution promulgated by China. The issue was being hotly debated in Hong Kong newspapers, where some analysts predict a backlash if China rolls back basic freedoms in the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people. ""The Preparatory Committee's decision, if carried through, will certainly add to the number of political trials that greet the birth of the SAR,"" wrote political analyst C.K. Lau in the South China Morning Post. ""Should the outcome of those trials be politically unpopular, more and not fewer demonstrations and rallies are likely. This will be bad for Hong Kong's international image at a critical time."" ","PeterHumphrey"
"The proposed $6.6 billion acquisition of modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp. by computer network equipment manufacturer 3Com Corp. triggered a drop Thursday in the stocks of those and other major network companies. Santa Clara, Calif.-based 3Com's stock fell $4 to $35 and was the most heavily traded issue on Nasdaq, with more than 40 million shares changing hands. U.S. Robotics dropped $1.875 to $59.125, also on Nasdaq, and was the second-most active share. Analysts said the proposed stock swap unveiled Wednesday undervalued Skokie, Ill.-based U.S. Robotics, the world's leading maker of computer modems for the consumer market. ""I think U.S. Robotics shareholders are being robbed,"" said Donaldson Lufkin analyst Eric Buck, who harshly criticised the terms of the deal. Several analysts said the offer -- involving stock and options valued at $7.3 billion in all -- put a low-ball value on U.S. Robotics of 20 times annual earnings vs. its historic multiple of 25. ""If anything, this deal is more of a take-under than a takeover,"" Salomon analyst Peter Swartz said of the 3Com deal. ""Both stocks are down 50 percent from their highs."" Swartz noted that many network stocks are trading at historic lows. U.S. Robotics Chairman Casey Cowell said the sale price was ""absolutely"" not too low, noting that networking company valuations have been very volatile recently and that both U.S. Robotics and 3Com stock prices have fallen. 3Com especially has been under pressure after announcing its fiscal third quarter revenues would be weaker and that it cut prices on its core product, its adapter cards. The merger, if approved by shareholders and government regulators, would create a combined company with $5 billion in annual revenues and 12,000 employees -- second only to leader Cisco Systems Inc. with more than $6 billion in annual revenues. The merger also comes as the Internet and other computer networks continue to grow in importance. Analysts said the deal put pressure on other network equipment players to use their stock to fund major acquisitions of their own. ""We believe the competitive landscape of the networking sector is undergoing a fundamental restructuring,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Bill Rabin said in published comments. ""Other networking vendors will have to combine or be bought."" Along with 3Com and U.S. Robotics, network company stocks were among the most actively traded on Nasdaq Thursday. Cisco Systems fell $3.06 to $55.06, Ascend Communications Inc. dropped $5.375 to $57, and Cascade Communications Corp. slipped $2.50 to $30.125. The main beneficiaries of the 3Com-Robotics deal appeared to be Bay Networks Inc. and Shiva Corp. -- two stocks that have sat in the doghouse for some time -- based on their potential as acquisition targets, analysts said. Shiva rose 62.5 cents to $15.875 on Nasdaq, recovering from its historic low, while Bay added 12.5 cents to $19.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. ""The merger forces other players in the industry to ante up to play in this bigger game,"" said Steve Harmon, an independent financial analyst who publishes the Internet Stock Report. ""It forces equipment makers to look for end-to-end solutions supplying network products to both businesses and consumers,"" he said, referring to how the 3Com-Robotics merger would allow the combined company to compete in both markets. The pressure to do deals adds to the burdens already weighing on the computer network industry, analysts said. Earnings shortfalls or close calls, fears of slowing industry growth and cautionary comments from 3Com, Cascade and Shiva have triggered fears about the whole sector, Rabin said. In addition, technology changes in the industry and the growing threat of competition from outsiders like chip makers Intel Corp. and Rockwell International Corp. have dimmed the outlook for the industry as a whole. Some analysts cited fears that Intel may decide to integrate network adapter cards or modem chips directly into the computer chassis it builds, rendering stand-alone products from many network suppliers a commodity -- if not obsolete.

"U.S.-based Unisys Corp said on Tuesday it has appealed to the Czech Economic Competition Office a Defence Ministry decision awarding an army contract to a consortium of Electronic Data Systems and Digital Equipment Corp. ""Unisys submitted...a proposal for investigation of the decision of the Defence Minister of the Czech Republic,"" the company said in a statement. Last week, Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny rejected a first round appeal by Unisys and IBM Corp saying he believed his decision in March to award a 1.3 billion crown army information system deal to EDS-Digital was correct. Vyborny chose EDS-Digital despite a recommendation by a steering committee to chose Unisys's bid. ""By this step (the appeal), Unisys is continuing in its effort for recognition of its victory in the public tender...because it is convinced of the seriousness of its arguments,"" the statement said. Vyborny has said that he decided in favour of EDS-Digital due to the lower price of its bid. Unisys has said that price was not weighted in accordance with the tender rules, and that EDS-Digital's offer was not complete. EDS declined to comment. Unisys won an original four billion crown supply tender last year, but it was cancelled in August when competition authorities found irregularities in the process. Vyborny said after the second tender that the ministry had decided to ignore the recommendation of the tender committee also because some members's evaluations were far different than the rest of the committee. Unisys has said it was suspicious that the original tender was abolished and rankings were changed when it won again. ""Unisys is proposing cancellation of the decision and hopes the government of the Czech Republic will deal with the situation around this strategic order,"" Unisys added. A number of other Czech military tenders have been marked by controversy, sometimes including allegations of graft. Installation of the staff information system is seen as a large step on the Czech army's path to compatibility with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's military command. NATO leaders will decide in July which former communist countries will be invited to join the alliance. The Czech Republic is a front runner along with Poland and Hungary. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"Two major Wall Street brokerages lowered their earnings estimates for AT&amp;T Corp. Monday amid growing competition in the industry, sparking a heavy sell-off of the stock. The stock slid $2 to $39.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the second most-active issue. MCI Communications Corp. lost 75 cents to $33.125 on Nasdaq and Sprint Corp. also lost 75 cents to $39.25 on the NYSE in sympathy. ""It is in AT&amp;T's court,"" said analyst Barry Sine of SBC Warburg. ""The more they spend on marketing their new services for the long term, the lower 1997's results will be."" The market was spooked by Salomon Brothers analyst Jack Grubman, who cited higher spending and greater competition in the telecommunications market. He cut his estimate of AT&amp;T's 1997 earnings to $3.00 per share from $3.60 and his 1998 estimate to $3.25 per share from $3.80. Fourth-quarter 1996 earnings per share will be closer to 70 cents than the previously forecast of 78 cents, he added. Grubman said his new estimates may ""still be too high,"" but he continued to recommend holding AT&amp;T stock. AT&amp;T reported third-quarter profits of $1.4 billion, or 89 cents a share, on revenues of $13.2 billion. First Boston Corp. also lowered its AT&amp;T earnings estimates, but agreed with most analysts that Salomon's view was too bearish. ""Salomon's number is for a dire outcome,"" said Frank Governali of First Boston, who expects AT&amp;T to earn $3.25 to $3.45 a share for 1997. ""I would be shocked if AT&amp;T diluted its 1997 earnings down to $3.00 per share,"" said Richard Klugman of PaineWebber. AT&amp;T said it does not comment on stock activity or analysts' reports. ""We have not yet determined what 1997 will bring, but it is safe to say we do not agree with the more pessimistic comments,"" said a source at AT&amp;T who declined to be identified. The source acknowledged the company was facing stiff competition from traditional rivals like MCI, as well as small aggressive competitors and soon, the regional Bells. Governali said AT&amp;T had a choice to make: ""Either to run the business for 1997, in which case they could make $3.60 per share, or to position itself for the long-term, in which case there is no way they can"" earn that amount. Analysts say the whole industry faces the same dilemma. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 will release the regional Bells into the long distance market place this year, on top of a horde of tiny rivals that have been nibbling away at the customers of the big three. Though AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint can enter the local phone market, they will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to advertise their services, push their brand names and build network facilities to key business customers. Grubman's research note said he believed AT&amp;T was losing hundreds of millions of dollars on its popular Worldnet Internet access service too, because of high costs. Analysts said MCI and Sprint have already bitten the bullet by warning analysts of increased spending, but AT&amp;T had not done so. ""Sprint and MCI have already done it. MCI's merger with British Telecommunications Plc is a tacit admission of that fact (that you need very deep pockets to succeed),"" Governali said. SBC Warburg's Sine said MCI told analysts it would spend an extra $200 million to $300 million this year on marketing, but the stock was not hit because it is supported by the value of the planned British Telecom merger, announced in November. Separately, AT&amp;T said it won a $341 million contract from Delta Air Lines Inc. for worldwide voice and data services. The seven-year contract extends an existing agreement between the two under which AT&amp;T provides a virtual network for the airline. The new contract will provide Delta with intelligent call-processing to reduce reservation backlogs. In another announcement, a partner in an African consortium that is bidding to take over Ivory Coast's Ci-Telcom telephone company said AT&amp;T agreed to buy a 35 percent stake in the consortium, Africa Bell. Ci-Telcom, with an estimated value of between $200 million to $350 million, is the most important company on Ivory Coast's privatisation programme. AT&amp;T's involvement, if the Africa Bell bid succeeds, would represent a major breakthrough for an American company in a traditionally French domain. Ivory Coast is the most important economy in France's former colonies in West and Central Africa. ","NickLouth"
"China's new central depository has ambitious goals to clean up the chaotic state debt market and implement risk controls to prevent losses from a chain of debts, and analysts said it may have the clout to do just that. Formally registered last month, the China Government Securities Depository Trust and Clearing Co was created by the central bank, the People's Bank of China, and the Ministry of Finance and six other shareholders with capital of 180 million yuan ($21.6 million). ""Our primary goal is to solve the problem of risk on the state debt market,"" said Wang Ping, executive vice-president of the clearing house. ""We want to bring risk down to its lowest possible level."" Other goals include providing a centralised clearing system and uniting nationwide back office operations, Wang told Reuters in an interview. Another major aim was to prevent borrowers wanting funds amid a national credit squeeze turning to loopholes on China's fledgling repo markets, resulting in huge levels of debt estimated at 50-60 billion yuan ($6.0-7.0 million). The central bank planned to issue debt to clear up the outstanding chain of debt that had resulted from institutions engaging in the banned practice of turning to the repo market while holding bills worth as little as three percent of the value of funds raised, Wang said. The clearing centre has been quietly carving out a niche for its operations aimed at regulating the chaotic and disparate system since it won a battle with Shanghai's Foreign Exchange Trading System to handle China's repo market. Wang said the Beijing-based securities depository hoped to have united all bond and repo back office operations within 1997, and had ambitious goals for its future. ""We want to promote the merging of financial policy and monetary policy,"" Wang said. ""With the support of the People's Bank and the Ministry of Finance, we are moving toward international market practices and hope to set up a foundation for the opening to foreigners of China's debt market,"" he said. However, he said that this target remained several years in the future and would depend on China's ability to make its yuan currency convertible on the capital account. Officials have said they would like full convertibility by the year 2000. The securities depository also appeared poised to become the main channel through which the central bank would conduct its open market operations. In 1996, the first year the central bank conducted open market operations, turnover was more than 4.0 billion yuan, Wang said. ""The amount this year will be significantly larger. ""The People's Bank will put into effect a double-track system of direct and indirect control,"" he said. ""On one hand it will control the scale of loans while on the other it will greatly expand open market operations and discounting."" The central bank aimed to end direct controls by 1998, he said. It would also issue short-term debt of one-year and below maturity to trade with state banks this year, he said. Officials declined to reveal the planned size of central bank open market operations, but some sources said turnover could soar as high as 200 billion this year. Wang acknowledged that the new securities depository had run into some opposition, citing unidentified interest groups in some regions as well as market players who did not fully understand the need for a regulated system. The bulk of China's state debt is traded through the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges, as well as through dozens of smaller centres scattered across China. ""So we need administrative measures to help us to do our work,"" he said. ","JaneMacartney"
"British utility stocks rose on Friday on hopes for shareholder benefits after Southern Electric said it would make a complicated share buy back worth up to 156 million pounds ($252.8 million). Analysts said Southern's move, which followed a similar Yorkshire Water plan announced on Thursday, could provide tax benefits and might bolster arguments against the opposition Labour Party's plans for a one-off levy on utilities. Southern followed a trail blazed on Thursday by Yorkshire Water by offering a share consolidation which will give all holders free B shares. It will then offer to buy back these shares at a fixed price, in Southern's case 60 pence per existing ordinary share. Southern's shares were up 13 pence to 800-1/2 pence by early afternoon and other shares in the water and electricity sectors followed their lead, with South West gaining 10 pence to 672-1/2 pence and Anglian up 11-1/2 pence to 637 pence. ""All the utilities are up on the back of this, everyone is talking about buy-backs,"" said one trader. Analysts said the moves by Southern and Yorkshire Water would decrease reserve capital and help the companies to avoid paying excess interest on Advanced Corporation Tax (ACT), which they can claim back from the government in two years' time. The proposals are open to all shareholders and were seen by analysts as a tax-efficient way of returning value. At the same time, the measures will increase the level of debt for companies, which could provide a bolster to arguments against a one-off ""windfall"" tax proposed by Labour, analysts said. Labour, which is ahead of the ruling Conservatives in polls before a general election due by May, has said it will impose a windfall levy on excess profits of utilities but has given no details of the tax's size or scope. ""Southern is gearing up ahead of an election, which might reduce its exposure to a windfall tax,"" the analyst said. ""A Labour government would find it hard to press them if they claimed there was no spare cash to pay the tax. I'm just surprised Southern has got rid of so little cash,"" the analyst added. Other companies seen likely to pursue similar moves include Severn Trent, which is waiting to complete a 10 percent share repurchase after picking up 4.9 percent on the market and a small stake from the government in December last year. South West has a mandate to buy back up to 10 percent of shares and finance director Ken Hill said when half year results were announced in November that the balance sheet was strong enough to handle such a move if appropriate. Wessex Water announced a 10 percent buyback in December which attracted responses for around 3.2 percent and has also said it will buy around 87 percent of a 19.5 percent stake held by Waste Management International. Analysts have also suggested Yorkshire Electricity, one of two independent regional electricity companies (Recs) along with Southern left after a spate of takeovers, might have funds for a buyback.

"Residents of China's capital voiced emotions ranging from shock and sadness to cold indifference after waking on Thursday morning to news of the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Extra police on Beijing's sunlit lanes and the bright red national flag flying at half-mast in Tiananmen Square were the only hints of a break from a routine after the early morning announcement that the greatest communist reformer of the 20th century was dead. ""My first reaction is great shock,"" said Liu Hongxin, a 21-year-old student waiting for a train in the pre-dawn chill at Beijing's main railway station. Deng, the gravel-voiced mastermind of 18 years of reform that turned China from a backward Stalinist state into an emerging economic superpower, died of respiratory failure in an advanced stage of Parkinson's disease late on Wednesday. He was 92. ""I feel a great sadness,"" said snack vendor Xie Weicai as he prepared his pavement stove for the morning's business, but his regret was not universal among the capital's residents. But others had quite different reactions. ""I would consider losing 100 yuan ($12) much sadder than the death of Deng Xiaoping,"" said one taxi driver on an early morning shift. ""It has nothing to do with me."" It was business as usual on the capital's streets, with residents busy opening shops and crowding onto buses to go to work, in stark contrast to the paralysis that gripped China with the passing of Chairman Mao Zedong in 1976. ""Then we cried like we lost our father and mother,"" said one driver parked near Deng's central Beijing residence. ""Now everyone is indifferent."" Analysts said the initial calm would probably be matched by a period of low-key political activity as China's leadership adjusted to the post-Deng era. ""There is going to be a lull,"" said Tai Ming Cheung, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong. ""There may be a certain amount of policy paralysis... but beyond that I don't see any great changes."" Deng's death would prompt a surge in jockeying for political position among China's communist leaders, who are already preparing their positions for the crucial 15th Party Congress to be held in October, he said. Deng's anointed heir, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, is considered favourite to assume the senior revolutionary's mantle of leadership, but analysts say Deng's death will also give rival pretenders to power a chance to boost their influence. Police, some carrying assault rifles, stood guard at the end of the nearby lane in central Beijing where Deng had lived and patrolled the lanes around the Zhongnanhai government compound near the Forbidden City, former abode of China's emperors. In Tiananmen Square, focus of pro-democracy protests in 1989 that were crushed on Deng's orders, residents and visitors gathered to see the dawn raising of China's flag. The bright red flag emblazoned with five gold stars was raised to half-mast by a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, one of a squad that had marched up from the Forbidden City with bayonets at their shoulders. While most bystanders were still unaware of Deng's passing, a few who braved the morning chill on the square -- still festively decorated for the Chinese Lunar New Year this month -- had heard the news and had come to say goodbye. ""I saw the news on the television this morning and came over to watch the flag-raising,"" said one factory worker from China's central Anhui province. ""I wanted to pay my respects.""

"Old and young couples waltzed around the sunny marble plaza of Shanghai's People's Square on Thursday, many of them oblivious to the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. ""I didn't know, but death befalls all men alike,"" a 70-year-old man said, quoting an ancient Chinese saying. ""The government has prepared for the transition for a long time,"" he added, before gliding off with his partner in time to music blaring from huge mushroom-shaped speakers. People gather in the square every day to dance and exercise. There was general apathy in Shanghai about the death of the man who led China for 18 years. The news that Deng died on Wednesday was first broadcast on Shanghai radio at 6 a.m. on Thursday (2200 GMT Wednesday) and on television an hour later. ""I heard the news when one of my neighbours stuck her head out of the window and shouted it to all and sundry,"" one young man said. ""That happens whenever there is big news -- I can't remember what the last big news was."" Shanghai television stations broadcast programming beamed directly from Beijing's China Central Television, replaying over and over the news of Deng's death being read by black-suited announcers. Shanghai radio stations broadcast dirges and historical accounts of Deng's contributions to China's political, social and economic development. One station played speeches by the gravel-voiced Deng, whose pragmatic reforms transformed China from Stalinist state to economic powerhouse. In Shanghai, China's biggest city and economic hub, many people were confident the government was well-prepared for a smooth transition of power. ""Chinese people are now more interested in evolution than revolution,"" a university graduate in his mid-twenties told Reuters. ""The government's priority is social stability. ""Deng was very conservative, even Stalinistic in his thinking, so now maybe we will see younger people, people with more understanding of the way the world works, coming to the fore,"" he added. ""But change won't come for some time. The leaders will want to consolidate their positions before they make any changes,"" he said. For one 16-year-old the greatest sadness of Deng's passing was that the elderly leader would not witness the handover of the British colony of Hong Kong to the mainland in mid-year -- one of his goals -- or see the rapid development of Shanghai. ""Deng came to Shanghai in the early 90s and told us to make great progress from year to year,"" he said. ""Now he won't be able to see just how well we are doing."" ""We have confidence in our leaders that things will be okay and that they are well prepared for the transition,"" said a middle aged woman exercising in the warmth of a sunny Shanghai morning. ""The markets will drop. I guess that will bring some good opportunities to make money,"" a taxi driver said when asked what difference Deng's passing would make. ""But I don't buy shares so it makes no difference to me."" Shanghai's B share index fell sharply at the opening on Thursday morning on the news of Deng's death, but was up by the midday close by 0.29 percent to 65.318 points on volume of 21.245 million shares worth $8.62 million. Brokers said heavy bargain-hunting and institutional buying that came in after the low opening was behind the rises. ""Whatever changes there are immediately after Deng's death, they won't have a lasting effect,"" another driver told Reuters. ""Give it a couple of days and everything will be back to normal,"" he said. ","LynneO'Donnell"
"Western oil joint ventures in Russia, their hands tied by myriad taxes and the unknown policies of a new energy minister, are finding it tougher than ever to make money, industry sources said on Friday. ""Nothing's really happening on the jv side because they (the Russians) don't have a good investment vehicle,"" said an independent U.S. energy consultant in Moscow. ""And I don't see anything that would suggest a quick turnaround."" Zarko Stefanovski, an oil analyst at T. Hoare &amp; Co brokerage in London, estimated net revenue on each barrel of oil produced and exported from Russia by joint ventures at about $4.40. That is after current per-barrel costs of about $2.70 for operations, $2.75 for transport, $2.00 in excise duty on output, $0.65 in pipeline tax, mineral royalties of $1.30 and road and housing taxes of $0.35. Then comes Russia's 35 percent profits tax, which is revenue, not profit, based. ""The biggest nightmare is having to adjust the budgets meeting after meeting after meeting,"" said a Western oil man, complaining that Russia's taxes changed constantly. ""Morale in the company then falls because we don't get the money to do what we need because the economics are skewed."" About 40 Western ventures produce and export Russian oil -- but their output, at about 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), is a drop in the bucket of Russia's total 6.2 million bpd. ""The export tax is gone, but these other taxes have more than made up for it,"" added a Western energy consultant in Moscow who works with major U.S. oil companies. ""You can't say across the board everyone's making a profit."" Joint ventures were thought to be a cheaper, easier and faster way than more complex production-sharing contracts to access Russia, the world's third-largest oil producer, which could hold five percent of the world's proven reserves. ""They have a potential to be a success long-term,"" said Brian Leonard, first deputy director of KomiArcticOil, which groups British Gas Plc with Russia's Komineft and a local geological outfit. But Zarko said joint ventures would take off only when their bigger cousins, multi-billion dollar production-sharing contracts undertaken by Western majors, get to the output phase -- at least several years down the line. In the absence of an acceptable legal framework, many ventures plead for Kremlin favours to secure special deals. Western oil men bow and scrape before ministries and the cabinet on two fronts, the Petroleum Advisory Forum and the Moscow International Petroleum Club, which includes Russian industry executives. The policies of new Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov remain unclear to oil men and tax changes from other officials have not been forthcoming. A new threat comes from Russia's State Customs Committee, which says prominent ventures should pay millions of dollars for ""excess"" exports -- including White Nights, a 50-50 venture between Phibro Energy Production Inc and Russian Sidanko's Varyoganneftegaz, and KomiArcticOil.

"Beijing's rare use of United Nations clout to stall the Guatemalan peace process was a clear signal of China's determination to punish rival Taiwan's small band of diplomatic allies, analysts said on Sunday. ""Beijing simply will not let anyone forget the price they will pay for supporting Taiwan,"" said one Asian diplomat. ""They (China) clearly want to make sure Taiwan's allies learn a lesson, and if they break ties with Taipei, all the better."" Beijing prefers to take a low-key approach to diplomacy at the United Nations, where it sees itself as a champion for developing nations, preferring abstentions to vetos on issues where it disagrees with the Security Council majority. But to a leadership that has staked much of its credibility on its nationalist credentials, Taiwan is an issue so visceral that its usual diplomatic norms no longer apply. The diplomatic anger that prompted China on Friday to veto a U.N. mission of 155 unarmed peacekeepers to disarm Guatemalan rebels was the product of Beijing's 48-year rivalry with the Nationalist-ruled island. China has long worked to isolate Taiwan, which it has considered a renegade province since it became home to the defeated Nationalists at the end of a civil war in 1949. Beijing sees diplomatic support for the island as backing for the splitting of China, or for Taiwanese independence. The People's Daily, mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party, said Guatemala's warm ties with Taiwan left Beijing no choice but to exercise its U.N. veto to defend the motherland. Guatemala had damaged China's territorial integrity, interfered in Beijing's internal affairs and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, the newspaper quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang as saying. ""We had no choice but to vote against the draft decision on peacekeeping,"" Shen said, adding that it was up to the Central American nation to resolve the situation. ""Let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off,"" he said. China has made clear it has no particular objection to the dispatch of a peace-keeping mission to Guatemala for three months to implement a U.N.-brokered accord agreed last month by the government and leftist rebels. Guatemala's Taiwan ties alone were behind Beijing's decision to kill the mission, which was aimed at putting a final end to more than 36 years of war in which more than 100,000 people were killed and a further 40,000 ""disappeared"". The Friday night vote left Beijing isolated 14-1 in the Security Council -- an ironic result coming just weeks after state media crowed over U.S. diplomatic isolation following Washington's use of its veto in a vote on U.N. leadership. While China has long been considered a slumbering dragon at the United Nations, no issue is as likely to rouse the nation from its diplomatic quiet as Taiwan. China has vowed to invade the island if it ever declares independence and has made non-recognition of the Taipei government the centrepiece of its international strategy. The veto of the Guatemalan peace mission drew predictable fire in Taiwan, where the ruling Nationalist Party has long denied any dream of formal succession but says China must develop democracy before reunification can be considered. ""If Beijing pushes hard on Taiwan again and again, it will only push Taiwanese people farther away (from reunification),"" the China Times newspaper said in its Sunday editorial. ""The United Nations will become the main site (for Beijing) to suppress Taipei's diplomacy,"" said the United Daily News. ""The diplomatic war between the two sides is heating up."" ","MureDickie"
"The jailing of one of the founding fathers of modern China's stock markets, announced this month, has sent a chill through the markets, with a clear message that no one is exempt, analysts said on Monday. But they said the impact on prices from the sentencing of Guan Jiansheng, former head of top securities house Shanghai International Securities Co (SIS), would be minimal because of the careful timing of the announcement. Official media announced on February 3, just ahead of the two-week Chinese lunar new year market holiday, that Guan had been sentenced to 17 years in prison for embezzlement and accepting bribes. A Shanghai court convicted Guan of accepting 294,000 yuan ($35,000) in bribes and misappropriating 2.4 million yuan in public funds between 1992 and 1994, media reports said. ""Guan was one of the founders of China's modern stock markets and the heavy jail sentence has sent a chilly message to other major players on the stock markets,"" said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage. ""This is a warning to all brokerage officials intending to profit from illegal securities trading by taking advantage of their posts,"" said an analyst with China Guotai Securities in Shenzhen. HG Asia's Shanghai respresentative Bruce Richardson said the Guan sentence was aimed at pulling the markets into line despite the relatively lax supervision. ""They're sending a message. There's a certain amount of bitterness among people who don't make a lot of money in China, and the heavy penalty shows these people that the government cares,"" he said. A second Shanghai brokerage executive said Guan's sentencing fitted with the tougher attitude towards the stock markets being taken by the securities authorities in recent months. ""Beijing's crackdown on the stock markets recently makes it very clear that it is determined to bring them into line,"" he said. ""Beijing has made it clear that it will excuse no one. Guan has been selected to serve as an example to warn others."" Guan, 49, was removed from his post as SIS president after the brokerage was implicated in a huge state debt futures trading scandal that rocked the Shanghai Stock Exchange in February 1995. SIS took a bond futures contract position far exceeding the legal maximum and then tried to force down the market through massive dumping, which resulted in it suffering huge losses from selling short in a rising market. The scandal prompted Beijing to ban state debt futures trading in May 1995 and SIS was later merged with the former Shanghai Shenyin Securities Co to form China's largest brokerage, Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities. ""Despite the severity of the sentence, the price impact on the markets will be minimal,"" said one Chinese stock trader. ""The markets had long expected Guan to be jailed."" During the early 1990s, Guan helped make SIS China's top brokerage house and helped to work out the framework for China's modern securities markets, established in 1990. Since late last year, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the top securities watchdog, has taken tough and public action against around 30 branches of major Chinese banks and securities houses for illegal credit bidding on new issues. It also fined Zhangjiajie Tourism Development Co Ltd for trading its own shares in the first such case in China's modern stock markets. ($1 = 8.3 yuan) ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"British utility Northern Electric Plc made a last-ditch attempt Monday to remain independent by trying to overturn the extension of an offer by CE Electric that gives the U.S. company a majority of its shares. Britain's takeover panel was meeting Monday to consider an application by Northern and its advisers BZW to appeal the board's unusual decision to extend the bid. The panel extended the deadline on the 782 million pound ($1.3 billion) bid from Dec. 20 until Dec. 24. The panel extended the fiercely fought bid on Friday in what newspaper reports said was a reaction to BZW's initial failure to disclose an extra 250,000 pound ($417,000) fee related to its performance in the bid. As the initial deadline expired, CE had obtained control of only 49.77 percent of Northern. But after the deadline was extended until Christmas Eve, CE notched that total up to 50.13 percent, a majority that would have given it victory. But acceptances after the initial deadline require consent from the Takeover Panel. Northern is now fighting to appeal the extension to try to make the late acceptances null and void and to retain its independence. ""If the panel rejects the right to appeal, or the appeal fails, then Northern will be taken over. If the appeal committee says the panel was wrong to extend the bid, then Northern stays independent,"" said one analyst who declined to be identified. At Northern's request, dealing in its shares was temporarily suspended from Monday morning, standing at 638 pence, pending the conclusion of the appeal process. CE, which is 70 percent owned by Omaha-based CalEnergy, then complained to the panel last week about share purchases made by BZW and Schroders. The panel said there was nothing wrong with those share purchases but did rule out further buying by BZW and Schroders when it extended the deadline. A BZW official told Reuters that the fee from Northern was not in any way linked to BZW buying of Northern shares. Northern had fought hard to fend off CE Electric's 650 pence per share bid, which it claimed undervalued the company, promising a 17 percent rise in its final dividend and lower than expected debt. CE Electric, which raised its original 630 pence offer on Dec. 6, maintained that it was offering a fair price and has already bought nearly 30 percent of Northern on the market. It has said it will hang on to that stake even if its bid fails, which analysts said could depress Northern's shares. The bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds ($933 million) fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year. ","JoWinterbottom"
"Ivory Coast has received three formal proposals for building new cocoa processing factories but no approvals have yet been notified, Ivorian Commodities Minister Guy Alain-Gauze said on Friday. ""There are projects involving Canatalou, STF-CI and Cargill,"" Gauze told Reuters after three days of cocoa sector reform talks with International Cocoa Organisation, donor and Ivorian officials. ""All have submitted formal proposals to the government which are being considered,"" he added. Ivory Coast aims to process annually 50 percent of its cocoa production it wants stabilised at 900,000 tonnes a year. In 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) an unexpectedly large 200,000 tonne mid-crop (April-Sept) took output to a 1.2 million tonne record. Total 1996/97 season output is expected to be over a million tonnes and higher, depending on the shape of the mid-crop. Rumours of factory plans surfaced in late 1996 with many firms said to be interested without deals signed. French Perpignan-based confectioner Cantalou, which makes CEMOI brands, has submitted proposals for building a 60,000 tonnes of beans a year capcity plant. An Ivorian firm, STF-CI, and a French partner are discussing building a 15,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes capacity plant for exporting cocoa butter and liquor exports to a Chinese chocolate factory under construction. U.S-based commodities giant Cargill, in discussions with Ivorian cocoa exporter SICC for construction of a third plant, has also submitted plans to Ivory Coast's government. Its capacity would be over 50,000 tonnes a year according to industry sources. SICC told Reuters its first processing project was likely to take shape in early 1997. The firm handles a total of 200,000 tonnes of cocoa in 1996/97 for clients including Cargill's Netherlands processing subsidiary Gherkens. ""We cannot think of handling that much without going into processing. We want to start in 1997 and are now at the decision stages with our partners,"" Deputy-Director Guillaume Adome told Reuters in an interview. One European processor industry in Abidjan for cocoa talks said he was surprised that a 25,000 tonne plant would be used for cocoa butter as well as powder production. ""It seems a bit on the small side for that,"" he said. Other industry delgates to the cocoa talks said it would be difficult to built plants by the end of 1997 but not impossible. Philippe Mian, technical advisor to Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, yesterday told Reuters all three plans were firm but that other factory plan proposals also existed. ""Procurement stages are advanced so it would be possible,"" he said, referring to the end of 1997 date. Mian presided over of three days of Consultative Committee cocoa reform talks which ended in Abidjan on Friday during which cocoa processing and cocoa quality were discussed. Gauze told Reuters Ivory Coast would be on target to meet its home processing goal if the plans went ahead. Ivory Coast currently has three processing factories with capacity for 180,000 tonnes. One is expected to increase capacity by 21,500 tonnes by 1998 taking Ivorian total capacity to 201,500 tonnes. If all three plant proposals are given government approval capacity would rise top a maximum of around 336,500 tonnes. Some industry observers have said Ivory Coast's processing target is unattainable. Local procesing of beans is part of an overall policy to add value to exports while taking low quality mid-crop (April-Sept) beans off the international market. ""Most output would have no effect on this year as it usually takes up to a year to build a normal plant,"" said one local processing official. -- Abidjan newroom + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"China on Thursday hinted at ethnic unrest in Moslem Xinjiang as a senior official called for unity in the western region that was rocked by separatist bomb attacks last week. ""Xinjiang ...must further improve ethnic unity, protect social stability and do a better job of building up Xinjiang,"" the official People's Daily quoted Vice-Premier Li Lanqing as saying. Li made no direct reference to the series of deadly bombings in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi on February 25, the day Beijing held funeral rites for late leader Deng Xiaoping. The Chinese vice premier's remarks to Xinjiang delegates at the National People's Congress, or parliament, were one of the few signs in the national media that the region had once again been shaken by ethnic unrest. Chinese police have arrested at least 20 ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi and Yining near Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan, exiled Uighur nationalists said from the Kazakh capital of Almaty. ""At least 20 ethnic Uighurs have been arrested...but the real number may be even higher because we have no information whether new arrests took place last night,"" Kakharman Khozhamberdi, head of a local Uighur association, told Reuters in Almaty. Officials and residents in Urumqi and Yining, contacted by telephone from Beijing, were unaware of the total number of people arrested in the attacks. Three bombs hidden on public buses blew up within minutes of each other in Urumqi on February 25 in an apparently coordinated attack. A fourth bomb failed to explode. The Xinjiang Daily said on Wednesday that authorities had arrested several people suspected of planting bombs and of selling detonators used in the attacks that killed nine people and wounded 74. Police were interrogating the suspects and had launched a manhunt for others still at large, the regional newspaper said. China's official media outside the Moslem region ignored the incident. Moslem separatists say they want to set up an independent ""East Turkestan"" in Xinjiang, a region that is home to many Turkic-speaking people such as the Uighur ethnic minority. Exiled Uighur nationalists have claimed responsibility for the latest attacks. Parliament's vice-chairman Wang Hanbin on Thursday introduced revisions to China's criminal law setting stiffer punishment for stirring up ethnic hatred and making it a capital crime to use race or religion to endanger state security. ""People in some places are stirring up hatred among ethnic groups in an attempt to undermine unity among them,"" Wang told parliament. In early February, an anti-Chinese riot erupted in Yining, about 50 km (31 miles) from Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan. Chinese officials said nine people were killed. The riot was one of the largest, most violent demonstrations for independence in Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover. Beijing, unnerved by the spectre of turmoil along its borders, had put the Lanzhou Military Region, which oversees Xinjiang, on alert against further unrest, Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily newspaper said on Wednesday.

"Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said on Monday his country viewed as frivolous and ""absolutely unacceptable"" Russian threats of economic reprisals for Prague's entry into NATO. ""We consider it frivolous to connect the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance with bilateral (Czech-Russian) relations and threaten economic sanctions in this context,"" the Czech news agency CTK quoted Zieleniec as saying. On Sunday, Moscow's ambassador to Prague Nikolai Ryabov warned the Czech Republic that key bilateral agreements with Russia might be jeopardised if it joined NATO. Ryabov told Russia's NTV commercial television that the former Warsaw Pact member's entry into the western defence alliance could mean a damaging loss of arms markets for Moscow. ""It would be a real blow for the Russian economy,"" he said. The ambassador went on to hint that Moscow could reconsider economic deals with Prague if it went ahead. ""Agreements fundamental to the Czech Republic, such as gas deliveries and nuclear energy, create a basis for future problems that our countries would face (if Prague joined NATO),"" said Ryabov, former head of Russia's central electoral commission. Zieleniec told CTK that Ryabov's statement made it clear why the Czechs wanted to join western organisations. ""This type of demand is one of the reasons why it is important, at the earliest, to become a member of the key western political, economic, and security organisations,"" it quoted Zieleniec as saying. He said he thought the ambassador's interview on Russian television was mostly for media consumption. The Czechs, Poland and Hungary are expected to be named among the first former-Soviet Bloc countries to be invited to join NATO at a July summit of the alliance in Madrid. Russian officials have intensified their rhetoric against NATO expansion plans, which they say threaten Russia's security, in the run-up to a summit in Helsinki this week between President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. Bill Clinton. Moscow hopes to use the issue as a lever with which to win concessions from the U.S.-led alliance on arms control agreements and other security and economic issues. After the collapse of former communist trade arrangements in the early part of the decade, total Czech trade turnover with Russia grew 9.8 percent in 1996 to $2.8 billion. But 1996 trade was heavily weighted in Russia's favour with Czech exports to Russia at $694 million and while imports from Russia were $2.1 billion. Czechs are still dependent on Russia for natural gas and most of its crude oil, but Prague is in the final stages of negotiations of a long-term contract for some of its gas supplies to come from Norway. Last year, the Czechs opened the Ingolstadt spur in the Transalpine crude pipeline from the Adriatic Sea, providing direct access to crude from the Middle East. The Czech power company CEZ a.s. is also dependent on Russian nuclear fuel for its lone atomic power station at Dukovany, but the company is expected to take U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel when it opens a new plant at Temelin by the end of the century. The Czech army is also considering several offers to modernise its mostly Soviet-era equipment with Western-made, NATO compatible goods. ","JohnMastrini"
"Tsingtao Brewery built its reputation as China's king of beers earlier this century by catering to thirsty foreign invaders. But analysts warn that after years at the top, a complacent Tsingtao today is seeing a new breed of invader -- this time in the form of nimble foreign beer makers -- eat into its once-impregnable market share. The brewery in eastern China's Shandong province, which in 1993 became the first Chinese company to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange has ""rested on their laurels for too long"", said one Beijing-based beer industry analyst. While Tsingtao has begun to respond to the threat from foreign-funded joint ventures and upstart domestic brewing groups, it still relies too much on its traditional brand-name prestige and is being out-advertised by thirstier rivals, he said. Company officials at the brewery's home in the scenic port city of Qingdao -- formerly Romanised as Tsingtao -- say they feel the pressure but are ready to fight back. ""We don't feel there is a crisis,"" said general manager Peng Zuoyi, the head of a new management team appointed earlier this year to boost the brewery's prospects. Tsingtao plans to boost production to 500,000 tonnes this year, from 350,000 tonnes in 1995, and hike annual output to 1.4 million tonnes by 2000, Peng told reporters at the brewery. LIFE CAN BE HARDER IN A MARKET ECONOMY Under communist China's old command economy, Tsingtao was a luxury commodity in chronically short supply. But Peng said the market economy and the arrival of foreign brands were taking their toll. ""Before the foreigners came to China, almost all the high-class restaurants and hotels had our Tsingtao Beer,"" Peng said. ""In the market where we were once 100 percent, we now account for perhaps 70-80 percent."" Against the glamour of foreign beers, Tsingtao touts its unique heritage as the premier domestic beer in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. The company was founded in 1903 and initially targeted thirsty Germans living in the port city that Germany had wrested from a weak China. Company officials say the beer also thrived during the Japanese occupation before and during World War Two. The decades of state control that followed the communist revolution of 1949 were a factor behind Tsingtao's later neglect of its home market, said Elizabeth Cheng, head of China research at HSBC James Capel in Hong Kong. ""Now with the new management, hopefully they will be able to do something more dynamic,"" Cheng said. A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY Growing competition is not the only worry cited by analysts, who have long complained about a lack of transparency at the brewery, which is still 44 percent state-owned. In 1994, the brewery drew investor ire when it was found to have lent out the foreign currency proceeds of its share flotations at high interest rates instead of investing them in its core business as promised. Peng said that problem was mainly a misunderstanding. ""In some ways Chinese methods are not quite the same as international ones,"" Peng said, adding that lack of a clear investment plan had caused Tsingtao to put its money elsewhere. The 4,000-strong workforce of the group, which has assets of 3.0 billion yuan ($360 million), is another potential concern. ""They are vastly overstaffed,"" said the Beijing-based analyst, a view seemingly borne out by the relaxed approach of many workers observed during a recent visit to the brewery. Tsingtao says it still has up to 2.4 percent of the Chinese beer market, although the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said last month that the share was now likely below 2.0 percent. While life as a listed company would never be as easy as it was under the command economy, the analysts said Tsingtao was too much of a national symbol to be allowed to fail. Tsingtao is also one of 10 domestic brewing groups that have been promised preferential loans and conditions from the government to help them compete with joint venture breweries. ""(Tsingtao is) troubled, but they will survive,"" said the Beijing-based analyst. ""They have very powerful backing... a lot of people do not want to see it go down the tubes."" ","MureDickie"
"Australian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Ltd is expected on Wednesday to report a 44 percent surge in annual profit, after the first full year of production from its new offshore Wanaea-Cossack fields. Petroleum analysts have forecast Woodside to post a net profit before abnormal items of between A$194 million and A$217 million for calendar 1996, according to a survey by profit forecasting service Barceps. The average of the forecasts is A$202.8 million, a 44 percent leap on 1995's pre-abnormal result of A$140.5 million.   But analysts told Reuters the 1996 result could have been better than the forecasts suggested had Woodside ironed out production problems at the new Wanaea-Cossack operation in 1996. ""We had (a forecast of) A$212 million at the beginning of the year and we had to pare that back because of the production problems at Wanaea,"" said David Cliff, analyst with brokerage Burdett, Buckeridge and Young. The brokerage is now expecting a pre-abnormal profit of A$196.6 million for 1996.   The Wanaea-Cossack fields came on stream in November 1995, but a series of technical and weather-related problems has plagued production. Output has rarely reached design capacity of around 115,000 barrels per day (bpd). The Cossack-Pioneer rig is still producing at well below capacity. Production was running at 65,000 bpd in mid-February but it had briefly dipped to 40,000 bpd earlier in the month due to another technical problem, the company said. ""It looks like it's going to be ongoing throughout this year, which is quite a surprise because they kept saying that 'we will fix it in three months'...,"" Cliff told Reuters.   ""Now they are admitting it is a very difficult problem and they might not be able to fix it at all this year without a major shutdown. We are revising our numbers (for 1997)."" Wanaea-Cossack fieldS are within the North West Shelf, of which Woodside, the operator, has an equal sixth share. Its partners are The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Japan Australia LNG (MiMi) Pty Ltd -- a partnership of Mitsui and Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp -- Chevron Corp and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.   Woodside's hedging book also helped keep a lid on profits in 1996, analysts said. Forward sales in 1996 are thought to have fetched an average oil price of around US$19 a barrel, below the average of spot crude prices for the year, they added. Macquarie Bank analyst Peter Best said Woodside's outlook remained strong, with reserves climbing and its half-owned Laminaria and Corallina oil fields in the Timor Sea coming on stream around 1999. ""Once Laminaria starts in say around 1999, earnings jump to close to A$500 million ... and they are sustainable at those levels for the foreseeable future,"" Best told Reuters.   -- Melbourne bureau 61-3 9286-1421 ","MarkBendeich"
"New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco said Friday that he planned to sue America Online Inc. if the company's negotiations with prosecutors from 20 states over consumer issues broke down. Vacco told a news conference he would sue the world's largest online service, with more than 8 million subscribers, to halt allegedly deceptive business practices and to win refunds for the company's frustrated customers. But America Online Chairman Steve Case said in an interview with the CNBC cable television channel that he was not considering subscriber refunds. He said the company was doing all it could to alleviate problems and said he understood customers' frustration. Vacco and other attorneys general or their aides from 20 states met with America Online Thursday in Chicago, either in person or via conference call, to discuss a barrage of complaints by subscribers who have experienced difficulty accessing the service from their computers. Vacco said he sent notification Thursday of New York state's proposed litigation to America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va. He said a lawsuit would allege the company engaged in deceptive sales practices, false advertising and fraud in selling online services. Company officials did not immediately comment on a possible New York lawsuit. America Online stock dipped $1 to $36.25 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The online service, which enables subscribers to send electronic mail, browse the World Wide Web and view proprietary content, has seen an upsurge in the number of subscribers -- and busy signals -- since it switched to a flat-rate, unlimited use pricing plan Dec. 1. Previously, AOL had billed subscribers according to how long they were online. AOL moved to placate angry customers last week, telling them it would spend $350 million to upgrade its network. It also asked them to try to cut their use during peak hours. Vacco said, ""We want to give the consumers a choice that gives them a refund if they want it. Don't just say 'Hang on;' give them a choice, which includes getting out with their money."" But Case, asked on CNBC about customer refunds, said, ""It's not something we are considering."" AOL already has been hit with at least four class-action lawsuits by subscribers. Vacco would not comment on Thursday's meeting. Case also was reluctant to talk about the meeting. ""I'm not going to discuss what is on the table with the attorneys general,"" he said. He said the meeting was ""constructive"" and that the attorneys general asked AOL not to talk about it. ""Our interests are really in paraellel,"" Case told CNBC. ""Most customers have seen a tremendous price cut (with the change in pricing), they have doubled their usage,"" he said. Case said he understood the frustration users feel when they cannot log onto AOL, saying he, too, experiences the same problem when he tries to log on from home in the evening. ""The reason we went to unlimited pricing is because our customers asked for it,"" he said. ""Once they are online, they don't have to worry about the clock ticking. We did say there will be a surge in demand and there will be some busy signals. It will probably take us a few months to build out our capacity. That's our intent and we are doing everything we can to do it as soon as possible."" The move to unlimited access itself incurred the ire of many of the same attorneys general. Last month, AOL reached an agreement with 19 state attorneys general over the flat-rate pricing, with AOL agreeing to pay automatic refunds to subscribers who did not want to pay $19.95 a month.

"Market confidence that St. Jude Medical Inc will proceed with its proposed acquisition of Ventritex Inc supported both stocks Friday, although analysts debated whether the deal might be repriced. Shares in Ventritex were up 1/4 to 18-3/8, even though the company confirmed Thursday that a third patient implanted with one of its heartbeat-regulating devices died January 22. ""The fact that this stock has not moved much on the news of the third death indicates the market thinks this deal is going to go ahead,"" said Needham &amp; Co analyst Jeffrey Barnes.   Shares in St. Jude were up 5/8 to 37-3/4. The company has said it is going forward with the Ventritex deal, but will do more analysis due to the deaths of the three patients. ""I still feel the transaction is going to go through. The issue is terms,"" said UBS Securities analyst Samuel Navarro. Analysts were focused on assessing the scope and cost to Ventritex of finding and fixing technical problems with 5,605 implantable defibrillators of the sort tied to the deaths. Ventritex could not be reached for comment. The company has likely found and reprogrammed about half of the defibrillators that could malfunction, analysts said.   Estimates of the cost to Ventritex of finding and fixing the rest of the devices, plus any potential legal liability that could result, varied widely. One analyst put it at $4 million, another at $10 million. Even at the higher figure, Barnes said, ""It's hardly a deal-buster."" Whether it is a deal-bender remains to be seen. ""These two companies definitely need each other. The big question mark is to what extent is the problem wih Ventritex's Cadence product a limited problem or a widespread problem ... The pricing will really depend on how bad the problem is,"" said Prudential Securities analyst Charlene Lu.   St. Jude has agreed to buy Ventritex in a stock swap valued back in October at about $22.50 per Ventritex share, or $505 million altogether. ""You're looking at a $4 discount today because everyone's nervous that St. Jude is going to cut the deal or walk away ... But there's no indication that St. Jude would walk away or cut the price,"" said Dillon Read analyst Matthew Dodds. With Ventritex trading at such a sizable discount to the offer price, analysts said, arbitrageurs were stepping in to buy the shares and assume the risk of more surprises between now and the expected closing of the deal in March or April.

"China's securities authorities on Saturday publicly punished a listed company for trading its own shares, opening a new phase in a crackdown on securities industry irregularities. The Shanghai Securities News said the Shenzhen-listed A share firm Zhangjiajie Tourism Development Co Ltd had been fined two million yuan ($241,000) and ordered to hand over all its profits from the illegal share trade. Shanghai brokers said it was apparently the first time that a listed company had been publicly punished for trading its own shares, something many Chinese companies are known to do. The company was accused of buying more than two million of its own shares from September to November last year, then selling part of the shares just before announcing a bonus issue on November 22, making a profit of 11.805 million yuan. The authorities also ruled that the Hunan Securities Trading Centre had violated the rules by allowing Zhangjiajie to illegally trade its own shares, and fined the centre 750,000 yuan, the newspaper said. The national watchdog body, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), decided to confiscate Zhangjiajie's profits from the illegal trades and ordered the firm to sell the shares it still held within two months, the newspaper said. The CSRC also ordered the company to convene quickly a shareholders' meeting to discuss the dismissal of general manager Yang Zhezhong and deputy general manager Li Jianzhang, who are responsible for the illegal trading, it said. China's securities authorities late last year launched a crackdown on banks and securities houses for illegal transactions involved with share issues. ""The public punishment of a listed company signals that the crackdown has now spread to the secondary (public trading) market,"" said one broker. ""Market rumours say that the central government is conducting a large-scale investigation into irregularities on the secondary market,"" a second broker said. ""We are expecting the exposure of more irregular transactions."" China's Company Law and securities trading rules ban listed firms from trading their own shares. ""The company's action of buying its own shares and then selling them just prior to a bonus issue was an instance of insider trading,"" the Shanghai Securities News quoted a CSRC circular as saying.

"A British firm believes it has developed a computer programme which could prevent other financial firms getting into the sort of situation Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) is currently trying to resolve. Numerous risk management systems already exist, but Frasin Limited says its Windows-based SOFWIN is the first to address operational risk management rather than financial risk. ""We believe it will prompt senior management to ask the right questions, which will create a more disciplined and controlled environment,"" Frasin's chief executive Philip Martin told Reuters on Tuesday. MGAM is attempting to unscramble a complicated web of investments in three of its funds. These led to the funds being temporarily suspended last week after it revealed ""suspected irregularities"" in the them. A fund manager for two of the funds was suspended at the same time and had his assets frozen by a High Court injunction. Ironically, Martin says he took the product to show Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank, some months ago with a view to selling it to them. He says he will still offer it to the firm, freely admitting that his prospects may have been boosted by publicity surrounding MGAM and a recent fine for fund management firms in the Robert Fleming group over so-called ""rat-trading"" by a fund manager in a Hong Kong joint venture with Jardine Matheson. ""I have to thank Morgan Grenfell and Jardine Fleming because their timing has been impeccable,"" he says with a grin. Martin believes the software could also help banks avoid another Barings situation, where so-called ""rogue trader"" Nick Leeson, was able to run both the front and back offices, effectively monitoring his own trading. Leeson is currently serving a long jail sentence in Singapore for fraudulent trading which led to losses of around $1.4 billion and culminated in the blue-blooded bank's collapse. While Martin admits it will never be possible to eradicate rogue individuals, he says closer monitoring by senior management of all an institution's operations is essential. If a chief executive, chief financial officer or other top official wants to avoid criticism in the event of a problem within the firm, then a programme such as that offered by Frasin, which is part of the HSBC group, should ensure they have adopted every measure possible to avoid such events. SOFWIN, which costs 12,000 pounds ($18,640) a year and must be signed up to for three years, takes the institution through a detailed questionnaire, with a possible 3,600 different questions. The collated results, after any subsidiaries or branches have also been through the process, then gives a clear picture of where any potential weaknesses lie, Martin said. It can also compare the standards of different branches and how they each match up with an ""ideal"" set-up. Much of the programme is devoted to dealing activities, as this has been found to be a major area of concern. ""The largest part revolves around dealing activities. I have spoken to senior managers who are scared to death about what their traders are up to,"" he added. But however thorough the programme, Martin says the buck stops with senior management and they are the main target of his marketing. ""It takes commitment by senior management. If they are not committed to it (assessing the company's organisational risk), then it's a waste of time. But they are opening themselves up to criticism,"" he said.

"Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik on Friday revealed details of his plan to restructure energy prices, which could pave the way to the rapid privatisation of energy distributors. Kocarnik told a news conference his plan includes a two step rise in electricity, natural gas and heating rates for households, the first on July 1 and the second a year later. He said he would seek cabinet consensus for the plan under which average electricity rates for households would rise 35 percent in July to 1.49 crowns per KWh, while the price for industrial customers would remain flat at 1.70 crowns per KWh. Under the current pricing structure, household rates are cross-subsidised by revenues from industry. ""We have to eliminate, or reverse, this ratio,"" Kocarnik told reporters. He said gas prices would also increase by 35 percent in the first stage. He added half the electricity rate hike would come in the form of a VAT increase on energy and fuels to 22 percent from five percent, while the other half would become revenue for suppliers. Kocarnik said proceeds from the VAT increase, a step towards unifying tax rates and holding down consumption, would be used for social transfers to those most affected by the price hikes. The minister said the second increase, planned for mid-1998, would only occur if the cost levels of energy companies required it. The second stage calls for a 32 percent rise in electricity prices, a 21 percent gas price increase, and a 10 percent rise in heating prices. The ministry has already approved a 39 percent heating price increase to be carried out this year. Kocarnik said the government's schedule of increasing energy prices slowly -- by about 10 to 15 percent every year -- was sending the wrong signal to consumers and producers, and created high inflation expectations. The three-party governing coalition is due to meet in February to debate further deregulation of controlled prices, including rents. A decision on further action in the energy sector will create good conditions for the often delayed privatisation of state holdings in energy companies, said Kocarnik. ""In the very forseeable future, I will submit a proposal on the privatisation of the distribution companies,"" he told the news conference. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"An Electronic Arts executive on Wednesday said the company was focusing on personal computers and CD-ROM devices as game platforms despite the success of new cartridge-based machines from Nintendo Co Ltd. Bing Gordon, executive vice president of marketing for the entertainment software company, said he had been surprised by the success in North America of the Nintendo 64, which was launched last year afer several delays. It became one of the big electronics hits of the holiday season.   Still, he said Electronic Arts probably would focus on other platforms because of Nintendo's decision to stick with more expensive cartridges rather than switch to CD-ROMs as its rivals Sony Corp and Sega Enterprises Ltd had done. ""We're pretty strongly in the camp that low manufacturing cost in media is important to the overall growth of interactive entertainment,"" Gordon said. ""I doubt we'll ever ship as many products for the Nintendo 64 in any year as we do on the PC or the Sony Playstation.""   He said Electronic Arts planned to launch its first game for the Nintendo 64, a version of its FIFA soccer product, in March or April to coincide with the European launch of the video game device. Electronic Arts announced Wednesday it had opened a game development studio in the Seattle area, which Gordon said was destined to become ""one of the top five worldwide centers of interactive entertainment creativity,"" along with Japan, Britain, northern California and possibly Los Angeles.   He noted that two of the company's four ""long-term competitors"" -- Microsoft Corp and Nintendo -- are located within a few miles of the new Electronic Arts studio, which employs 55 developers. About 40 of them came with last year's acquisition of Manley &amp; Associates Inc in nearby Issaquah, Washington. Anthony Garcia, a former Microsoft executive who is general manager of the new facility, said he hoped to add about 15 employees during the next year. Electronic Arts develops software for platforms owned by all its competitors, including Sony and Sega.   The company also is working to develop online products, including Ultima Online, which will go into a wide-scale beta test in April or May. Gordon said he hoped the game would be on store shelves in June. He described Ultima Online as a ""persistent world"" that could be experienced by up to 20,000 Internet players in a single day and 2,000 simultaneously. He said the company would wait until after a market test before deciding whether it would seek to charge for connect time in addition to the software. And he said there were still many issues to be resolved before multiuser Internet games could take off. ""This is not a boat that's about to leave the dock,"" he said. ""The most valuable thing we've done in Internet so far is to start replacing print advertising in our communication mix with Web marketing,"" Gordon said. He said the company is making money over the Internet by selling its software directly to users. 	  ((-- Reuters Seattle bureau 206-386-4848)) ","MartinWolk"
"British broadcaster Carlton Communications Plc on Wednesday reported an 11 percent rise in half-year earnings helped by a strong growth in advertising revenue. Carlton, which operates ITV commercial television licences for London weekday TV, the English Midlands and the west of England, raised pre-tax profits to 158.6 million pounds ($262.5 million) from 143.3 million after a one-off loss of around 4.0 million pounds. Lifting half-year dividend by 12 percent to 4.9 pence and sending the company's shares jumping, chairman Michael Green pledged that the group would continue to invest in businesses -- and boost prospects. ""We have maintained our clear focus, built up our market leading positions and enhanced both our profitability and our prospects for future growth,"" he said in the results statement. ""We will continue to build on this approach and make sure Carlton makes the best of its excellent prospects."" The results helped restore some enthusiasm in Carlton's shares, which have been underperforming the market by around 15 percent in the last three months. By mid-morning, the stock leapt 18.5 pence to 517.5p. Carlton, whose library boasts over 7,500 hours of TV programmes including almost 1,000 films, said its core broadcast business was one of the main drivers behind profits, seeing a 19 percent rise on the operating level to 72.6 million pounds. An 11 percent rise in advertising revenues, higher programme sales and a 5.2 million pound trading contribution from newly acquired businesses such as Westcountry TV helped boost earnings. Robert Jolliffe, media analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, is forecasting unchanged full-year pretax profits of 343 million pounds and said the performance of some of Carlton's divisions -- such as its products arm -- had been ""extraordinarily strong"" at the half-way stage. ""Carlton airtime sales continue to dominate ITV. They've seen good market share gains and a strong London market -- so they've done very well in the first half,"" he added. Carlton's share of ITV's advertising revenue edged up to 32.58 percent from 31.75 percent while telecoms, financial services and airline groups raised advertising spend in a battle to win new clients and keep old ones. But some brokers, such as BZW, are warning that the advertising revenue outlook over the next four to five years in Britain should be questioned against a background of increasing competition, analysts say. Another highlight in Carlton's results was its fast-growing Quantel division, which designs and manufactures tapeless editing and broadcasting systems for the film and television industry worldwide. Operating profits leapt 28 percent to 26.2 million pounds, fulfilling expectations of rapid growth. Some analysts expect new product launches to feed through into the bottom line in the next 12-18 months. But Carlton's video division cast a pall over results, with operating profits slipping to 36.2 million pounds on 12 percent lower turnover of 242.4 million. Chairman Green blamed the slow start to the year on the timing of releases and variations in the mix of the business, but added that he was optimistic about making progress in the second half. Analysts are awaiting news on whether Carlton and its partners in British Digital Broadcasting (BDB) have been awarded key digital terrestrial TV licences in Britain. Carlton in January joined rival TV giant Granada Group Plc and Rupert Murdoch's dominant pay-per-view broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc to form the formidable BDB. BDB wants to offer some 15 subscription channels. The group faces competition from Digital Television Network (DTN), owned by Nasdaq-listed NTL Inc -- but in what has been dubbed a classic case of David versus Goliath, most analysts tip BDB as the winner. Carlton, which has a cash pile of 166 million pounds, said it expected the Independent Television Commission watchdog to award the licence by the end of June. ""Digital terrestrial television brings enormous opportunities to Carlton,"" Green stated. ($ = 0.604 British Pounds) ","KirstinRidley"
"General Motors Corp.'s 50.8 percent drop in fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations earnings was a disappointment long anticipated by Wall Street, but the automaker's strong cash generation has hopes raised for a strong performance in 1997. Despite the earnings drop, GM's cash and marketable securities topped the $17 billion mark at year-end, up $2.5 billion from September 30, 1996 and up $6.8 billion from a year earlier.   Although $1 billion of GM's fourth quarter cash increase came from a tax refund, analysts said the $1.5 billion increase in cash from strike-marred operations was impressive. ""It's a good news bad news quarter,"" said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. ""It suggests that if 1997 is normal and largely free of strikes, it ought to be another good year for cash generation."" GM's fourth quarter North American production volume, mauled by strikes and new model launches, fell 11.4 percent, resulting in a $124 million North American loss, compared to a year earlier profit of $603 million.   But analysts expect GM to bounce back in 1997 with new models and robust production. And as the new product benefits that management has been promising for several years materialize, GM's 1997 profits and cash flow should swell. J.P. Morgan analyst David Bradley estimated that GM in 1997 could wind up with $28 billion in cash at the end of 1997, including about $4.5 billion from the sale of Hughes Aircraft Co to Raytheon Corp. That's about $15 billion above GM's cash reserve target of $13 billion, and he added that GM could make up to $12 billion of that available for stock repurchases.   ""This company could have enough cash to buy back a quarter of its shares,"" Bradley said. GM on Monday committed to repurchasing $2.5 billion worth of stock in the next 12 months, but GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh said the automaker wants to complete that quickly and ""revisit"" the stock buyback issue. Nonetheless, GM shares fell 1-1/8 to 60-3/4, reflecting profit taking on the stock's climb from the last month, earnings that were roughly in line with expectations  and continued market disappointment that GM did not announce a bigger stock buyback program.   ""I think the disappointment of yesterday was not counterbalanced by positive surprises today,"" said Prudential Securities analyst Philip Fricke. GM reported that its fourth quarter net income from continuing operations, which included a host of extraordinary items, came to $786 million, or $0.92 a share, down from $1.6 billion, or $1.95 a share, a year earlier. The results also included weaker profits in Europe, which is plagued with a slumping market. Earnings from International Operations, long GM's standout performer, will likely be flat or declining next year, putting more pressure on GM's North American operations. Fricke said 1997 is a ""show and tell"" year for that must reveal steady improvements in the automaker's vehicle profit margins. ""What will be the telling factor is whether the improvement in operating income goes way beyond what can be explained by higher production volumes,"" he said. To accomplish that, GM's new cars and trucks must be a hit with consumers and help reverse the automaker's long-term slide in U.S. market share. GM ended 1996 with about 31 percent of the U.S. market, down from 32.4 percent in 1995. ""GM has to make believers out of people as far as market share goes,"" added Healy. ""If they don't gain market share this year, I don't know if they ever will."" ","DavidLawder"
"The fate of Britain's Clyde Petroleum Plc hung in the balance on Tuesday as shareholders mulled over an improved 120 pence per share offer from predator Gulf Canada Resources. There was some disappointment that the Canadian group had failed to come up with a knock-out punch, and there were signs that key shareholders who will decide Clyde's fate might wait to see if a rival bidder emerges in the next two weeks. With Clyde's share price resolutely stuck at the 120 pence offer level in Tuesday afternoon trading, analysts said it seemed to be pulled two ways - by the possibility of another bid emerging and the suspicion that one or two large shareholders might accept Gulf's offer. Gulf Canada's final proposal, which valued the Scottish exploration and production company at 494.6 million pounds ($793 million), represented a 14 percent improvement on its original 105 pence offer made on December 18, and a 42 percent premium to Clyde's share price before the bid was announced. But the price was below the 125 pence per share many analysts had been expecting, and some said it had robbed Gulf Canada of the chance of pulling off a clear victory. Clyde immediately rejected the latest bid, saying it was ""worth a great deal more than this offer."" ""I think I would recommend holding (the stock) on the possibility of another bidder,"" one analyst said. Gulf Canada's president and chief executive officer J.P. Bryan however dismissed the prospect of a rival offer, saying there had not been ""a sniff or a rumour"" of a second bid. ""I can't see that anyone could possibly find justification for making a higher bid unless it is based on synergy or insanity,"" said Bryan, maintaining Gulf's line that it was paying a very full price for the British company. Hopes of a white knight centred on North America, where the habit of valuing oil exploration and output companies on the basis of their cash flow multiples makes Clyde look very attractive. The oil sector is also relatively cash rich after years of cost-cutting. ""The phone lines across the Atlantic will be buzzing,"" said an analyst at a leading UK bank. But he added that the struggle ""is quite finely balanced now. There are a few shareholders who control a majority of the shares and of those one or two have been dithering about what sort of level they would find acceptable. This has certainly caught their attention."" He said some shareholders would be worried that if Gulf Canada's offer failed then Clyde's share price would slide back to around 90 pence, which Gulf Canada said on Tuesday was its true value. Analysts said Clyde would now be working to persuade shareholders that they they could gain a better long-run return on their investment by sticking with the current management, who are seen as having turned the company around in recent years. Meanwhile Gulf Canada, which sees Clyde offering it a ""third leg"" in the North Sea to add to its strength in western Canada and Indonesia, will be hoping that a rival bidder does not focre it to dig even deeper into its pockets. --London Newsroom +44 71 542 7717 ","JonathanBirt"
"Australia's A$6 billion (US$4.68 billion) car industry could grind to a halt from late next week due to a crippling strike at a key supplier, industry sources said on Tuesday. The four major manufacturers -- Ford, Toyota, General Motors Holden and Mitsubishi Motors -- have warned local production lines will be shut down if the strike drags on much longer. The strike, in its fourth week, has crippled Melbourne's Martin Bright Steel factory, which holds a key position in the local car-parts industry supplying the car-makers. ""Obviously if supply of anything dried up, we would not be able to keep producing. We are keeping a watching brief,"" said Ford Australia's public affairs general manager, Wendy Perkins. ""We are still going and expect to be until at least Friday week (May 16),"" she told Reuters. The steel plant, owned by industrial group Email Ltd, is the supplier to TRW Steering and Suspension Australia Ltd, which is a monopoly supplier of power steering units to car-makers. TRW Steering and Suspension managing director Michael Laufer declined to comment on Tuesday, but an industry source said the firm could only keep going for another two weeks. TRW has supplied car makers for the past three weeks by finding substitute parts for the power steering units, but this is a stop-gap measure, the source said. ""The automotive companies have gone along with the substitution...but it's different material and they would prefer us to go back to the Martin Bright specifications,"" he said. About 130 workers walked off the job at the steel plant on April 11 in a dispute over wages. They have since picketed the site, preventing Email from moving stock out to its customers. In letters sent last week to Australia's labour market watchdog, the Industrial Relations Commission, car-makers said they would be forced to halt production and stand down thousands of workers from this week if the strike did not end quickly. But on Tuesday, Ford, Toyota and Mitsubishi told Reuters they could now maintain full production for at least another week, but perhaps for not for much longer. Toyota and Mitsubishi spokesmen told Reuters production was guaranteed for at least ""this week"". Holden, which had warned it would be forced to shut down a production line on Thursday, said it did not now see disruptions to production ""at this stage"". The four car-makers' have combined sales revenue of about A$6 billion, including over A$2 billion in export sales, and along with car-part manufacturers employ 45,000 people, according to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industry. The Martin Bright Steel dispute has also hit other suppliers to the car-making industry. ""I am sure there are half a dozen others on the brink,"" the source said. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), which wants a 15 percent wage rise over two years for the Martin Bright Steel workers, said on Tuesday the strike could escalate. ""We are talking about a major escalation of the dispute if they try to break that picket,"" AMWU organiser Craig Johnston told Reuters. A spokesman for Email was not available.

"China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday dismissed British opposition to Beijing's plans to disband Hong Kong's legislature and said it would not affect the smooth transfer of power in the territory this year. ""The British side's opposition to this is an overreaction and unreasonable and unnecessary,"" Qian told reporters. ""... if they (British authorities) continue to voice their opposition to the operation of the provisional Legislative Council I don't think it will have any impact on the smooth transition of Hong Kong,"" he said. Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, becoming a Special Administrative Region of China after 150 years of British rule. Beijing has pledged to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the transfer of power. China has said it will scrap Hong Kong's existing elected Legislative Council and install an appointed provisional body in a move opposed by Britain as well as the United States. Qian, who is also a vice-premier, conceded that foreign countries had commercial interests in Hong Kong but that did not give them the right to inferfere in the territory's affairs after the handover. ""No foreign country has the right to interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,"" he said, repeating Beijing's long-standing position. Qian also held out the prospect of legislators who lost seats in Hong Kong being able to run for posts in China's parliament, the National People's Congress. He said, however, they would have to recognise the Chinese constitution and accept China's procedures for choosing delegates. China's parliament has little real power and its main task is to approve laws drafted by the Communist Party. It has nearly 3,000 delegates and Hong Kong will be entitled to only 36 of those seats next year. ","WilliamKazer"
"President Ernesto Samper appealed to Colombian workers on Monday evening not to support the ""dark forces of chaos"" as the countdown began to the start of a nationwide strike, which threatens to be the biggest in 20 years. The last major national strike took place in Colombia in September 1977. At least 20 workers died in a single day of protest in Bogota. The army spent the day stationing troops in strategic areas of the country as union leaders warned that the indefinite public sector work stoppage, due to begin midnight Monday (0500 GMT Tuesday), could unleash widespread civic protest. The government warned that leftist guerrilla movements were planning a wave of attacks to coincide with the strike and said rebels could try to infilitrate demonstrations. ""I call on (state workers) not to join the dark forces which -- concealed behind a legitimate social protest -- aim to sow chaos and violence,"" Samper said in a televised broadcast to the nation. ""We will not permit the protest to affect the legitimate rights of citizens to peace, nor even less that it ends up in abuses or terrorist attacks,"" he added, repeating threats to declare the strike illegal if it paralysed basic services. State workers called the strike to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike, compared to the government's weighted 13.5 percent wage offer. They are also protesting at what they say is the whittling away of labour rights and plans for the privatisation of national and regional industries. Education Minister Jaime Nino cancelled all classes in state-run schools and universities to ""prevent risk"" to pupils and teachers. The strike threatens to disrupt air traffic, oil production, telecommunications and all non-emergency health services, labour leaders said on Monday. ""It has been a long time since the unions have really fought against the government and it's difficult to say how long this strike will last,"" said Gustavo Triana, one of the heads of the main oil workers' union USO, known for its combative, fiercely nationalistic stance. ""I think what we're building up to is a nationwide civic protest, which will involve not only state workers but also the private sector and social groups,"" he added. Government ministers and defence chiefs spent much of Monday morning huddled in an emergency security summit to discuss measures to combat street protests and the possible blockade of major highways. ""Orderly public demonstrations will be permitted but we will take firm measures to stop subversive elements taking part in the strike,"" Defence Minister Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez told reporters. All members of the armed forces, including police, were ordered back to barracks on Sunday. Gonzalez said police and troops would be sent in to boost security at airports and to set up roadside checkpoints across the country, including at the main entry points to the capital. A heavy military presence was also planned for the main oil production centre of Barrancabermeja -- the power centre of the USO, one of the most radical of Colombia's unions. Political analysts said the public sector strike could spark a groundswell of social unrest but ruled out direct parallels with the political chaos in Ecuador, which began with a general strike and ended in the ouster of President Abdala Bucaram.

"British mutual insurer Norwich Union said on Thursday strong demand had led it to increase the members' offer in next week's flotation to 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion). That means some 400 million pounds worth of shares will be clawed back from the public offering, primarily financial institutions, to satisfy members' appetite for extra shares which saw many queuing to beat the June 10 deadline. Some 800 million pounds worth of shares had originally been set aside to meet members' applications but this proved insufficient as members' rushed to top up their holdings at a 25 pence per share discount to the public offer price. For Norwich, the flotation will bring to an end more than 200 years as a mutual with policyholders owning the company. Demutualisation will allow it to separate the group's life operations and thus policyholders' returns from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business. It will also strengthen Norwich's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom. The flotation is likely to value Norwich, which has more than seven million customers, at around 5.5 billion pounds and create Britain's third-largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance. Nearly three million Norwich policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares in addition to the extra discounted shares. Norwich still expects the offer price to range between 240 pence and 290 pence per share suggesting large profits for those lucky enough to get extra shares. Bookmakers City Index are taking bets on a first day closing price of between 335 pence and 345 pence, an immediate profit of at least 70 pence per share. It would put the value of the minimum 300 free shares with profits members will receive at over 1,000 pounds. Many will receive far more depending on the value and duration of their policies. Non-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares. Institutional demand is a big factor in the likely sharp gains over the offer price. The two building societies who floated recently -- Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leceister -- saw their share price squeezed higher by financial institutions keen to buy the shares and maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios. Like Halifax, Norwich is almost certain to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies. The public offer, which is made up of the institutional offer, retail offer and employees offer, will be between 1.1 and 1.2 billion pounds following the clawback of the extra shares for members.

"- Chip designer Mosaid Technologies Inc will see earnings bounce back in fiscal 1998 as the chip market re-ignites, Chief Executive George Cwynar said on Wednesday. Cwynar told Reuters in an interview that he saw profit and revenue growth accelerating to the 20 percent range in fiscal 1998 from about two percent in fiscal 1997 ending April 30. ""This calendar year we're in, is going to be a slow recovery year,"" he said. Mosaid last week reported that earnings per share for the third quarter ended January 31 fell to C$0.06 from year earlier C$0.32 due to the collapse in memory chip prices in the past year and delayed orders for chip testing systems.     Cwynar said he expected the memory chip market to come back in 1998 as personal computer users snapped up the backlog of cheap chips and increased demand for Mosaid's bigger, faster designs. Analysts predicted that Mosaid, based in Carp, a town about 35 km (21.75 miles) west of Ottawa, would recover from its recent slump, aided by ACCELERIX, a single component that would combine the functions of memory and logic. Mosaid spokeswoman Sue Rutherford said that up to five analysts planned to start coverage of Mosaid, which posted revenues of C$37 million in fiscal 1996. One analyst who declined to be identified said: ""All the ingredients are there for a big comeback."" Mosaid increased its work in memory/logic design after acquiring a large stake in ACCELERIX Inc in October 1996.

"Cascade Communications Corp shares were crushed in a wave of selling Friday after company comments in a conference call stoked fears about future earnings. Several analysts slashed ratings on Cascade, citing concern that growth rates for its core frame-relay switching business may be slowing to industry levels of 30-50 percent from its prior 100 percent plus.

"McDonald's Corp. Thursday reported a 12 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits, in spite of weaker U.S. results, and said it plans to cut back on its restaurant expansion. The nation's biggest fast-food restaurant chain said its income rose to $410.0 million, including a $48.7 million after-tax charge, from $366.8 million a year ago. The charge reflects the company's plans to close about 115 low-volume satellite units across the United States this year. As of Dec. 31, McDonald's had 2,218 satellite units, which typically have a limited menu and are located in non-traditional sites like shopping malls. ""These are really the sites that didn't pan out,"" said McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Mike Conley. In 1997, McDonald's said it plans to open fewer satellite restaurants, while emphasizing full-scale units. As a result, McDonald's is trimming its overall restaurant opening plan for 1997 to between 2,400 and 2,800, compared with a previous target of 2,500 to 3,200. ""Going foward we think our emphasis is going to be traditional restaurants,"" Conley said in an interview. McDonald's said more than 70 percent of the new restaurants will be outside the United States. In the past, about two-thirds of McDonald's new units have been outside the United States. The fast-food giant, with more than 21,000 units worldwide, including 12,000 in the United States, said it is working to improve its U.S. results. In the fourth quarter, McDonald's said its U.S. operating income fell 28 percent, including the charge, to $217.7 million. Excluding the charge, U.S. operating income fell 4 percent. As analysts had expected, McDonald's said its domestic same store sales -- measuring results from units open at least a year -- were down in the fourth quarter and for all of 1996 compared with a year earlier. Offsetting the decline domestically was a 14 percent gain in international operating income and an 11 percent rise in sales in the fourth quarter. In the United States, however, McDonald's performance fell short of its goals, according to Jack Greenburg, company vice chairman and chairman-U.S.A. ""In 1997, our focus will be squarely on improving sales at existing restaurants through improvements in marketing, service and menu,"" he said in a statement. Conley said McDonald's will continue to be aggressive on pricing in the face of competition, but declined to give any specifics. ""We want to provide the best value to our customers ... and a big part of it is price,"" he said. ""You'll see us being aggressive on price-value as we always have been."" Schroder Wertheim analyst Wayne Daniels said he expects McDonald's to launch more national price promotions in 1997, as opposed to its current practice of giving franchisees the option to offer local promotions. ""(McDonald's) average ticket did climb during 1996,"" when it launched higher-priced premium sandwiches such as the Arch Deluxe, Daniels said. ""I do think that they will reverse that somewhat as they are a little more aggressive on national price promotions."" Conley said McDonald's will continue to work on food taste, but said changes would be ""evolutionary and not revolutionary."" ""So don't expect a spate of new products,"" he said. ""That's really unlikely."" McDonald's stock gained $1.125 to $46.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. ","PatriciaCommins"
"A wave of high-yielding Czech crown Eurobonds that has flooded the debt market since the beginning of the year has begun to ebb, as interest rates ease and arbitrage opportunities decline, analysts said on Tuesday. ""The Euro-madness is definitely over. We may see a couple more issues but those will be mainly by issuers who are active in the Czech Republic,"" Ota Otepka, chief bond trader at ING Barings, told Reuters. Since the start of the year, issuers have rushed to take advantage of a stable, strong currency and interest rates above 11 percent, flooding the market with nearly 30 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) worth of Eurobonds in just over four weeks. Dealers said that with interest rates so high, and a crown that is 65 percent linked to the mark but yielding seven to eight percentage points above it, the appetite for crown Eurobonds had appeared insatiable. But interest rates have eased some 60-70 basis points since the start of the year and yields have dropped, spoiling the appetite for many investors. ""Maybe lead managers were overly optimistic about the potential placing capabilities and appetite of foreign investors,"" said Jan Pudil of WoodCommerz. ""Of course this hunger has been filled quite substantially. At this stage we are at the level where these investors are now satisfied,"" he added. More than 20 bond issues were launched in crowns by a host of top-rated, retail-friendly names, lured by its reputation as one of Europe's most stable currencies. German media group Bertelsmann AG launched on Tuesday a one billion crown one-year bond with a 10.5 percent coupon, but the rate of issuance has slowed. Analysts estimate about 90 percent of the crown bonds were bought by retail investors from Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland. Investors saw a great chance of picking up high-yield, low-risk paper but issuers and managers were presented with an easy arbitrage opportunity since rates were so high. But Pudil said that issuers, once awash in opportunities for currency swaps, were now hard pressed to find advantageous rates allowing many to place bonds with coupons above 10 percent, a psychological minimum level. ""You have a three-year swap now at 10.25 percent and if you were to bring a cross-currency swapped three-year Eurobond, you get a coupon below 10 percent and you can't sell something to west European retail investors at below 10 percent,"" he said. Another trader added: ""A lot of the issues were swap driven, but swap prices have fallen below the Eurobond yields and this has stopped the arbitrage possibility."" ""We also may see declining interest in buying Czech Eurobonds because the crown is so strong that its security is declining,"" he added. The crown was fixed at a record high against its dollar/mark basket on Tuesday at 5.51 percent above the parity midpoint, some three percentage points higher than at the beginning of the year. Traders added that two and three-year bonds are almost impossible to launch now, given the lack of arbitrage options. Most issuers had preferred short-dated bonds anyway due to an inverted yield curve which meant higher coupons are available at shorter maturities. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($ = 27.92 Czech Crowns) ","AlanCrosby"
"Optus Communications Pty Ltd, Australia's second largest telecommunications carrier, said on Wednesday it expects a strong result for the year to June 30 and aimed for a sharemarket float in 1997 despite litigation delays. Optus also formally reported a net profit of A$58.9 million (US$46.4 million) in the six months ended December 31, 1996, up from A$7.1 million a year earlier. Sales rose 31.2 percent to A$1.19 billion, buoyed by a strong lift in revenue from its mobile phone business. Sales are expected to continue the strong trend in the 1996/97 second half, chief operating officer Phil Jacobs told Reuters. ""It will be somewhere (near) a similar amount,"" Jacobs said. ""We are expecting a very strong result for the full year,"" Optus chief executive officer Ziggy Switkowski told reporters at a briefing after the results announcement. Optus reported a profit of A$60.3 million for the 1995/96 year. Optus still planned a sharemarket float in calendar 1997 but that would have to await the outcome of litigation between its pay television offshoot, Optus Vision, and free-to-air television station Seven Network Ltd, Switkowski said. Asked if Optus Communications would postpone its float beyond this year, Switkowski said: ""No, not at all. The float is clearly held up by the process of the litigation. Once the litigation is resolved, the board will meet and make decisions about how the float should proceed. ""The timetable for this year is still very much our desire,"" Switkowski said. However, Switkowski said there was a possibility Optus's planned float would clash with the timing of the sale of one-third of the government-owned Telstra Corp, Australia's biggest carrier, which is seen by analysts as a far bigger capital-raising operation than for Optus. ""It is not impossible that those floats will happen about the same time, we will see later this year,"" he said. Switkowski would not comment on the litigation battle which, if Optus loses, could see it forced to sell its Vision stake at a discount to Seven. Optus Communications has pumped about A$605 million into Optus Vision, which is currently rolling out its cable network to 2.5 million homes or 40 percent of Australian households at a cost of about A$3.0 billion. The full deregulation of the Australian telecommunications industry on July 1, 1997, would pressure margins, Jacobs said. ""There is no doubt that there will be erosion in some areas of our business as competition comes in...but we fully expect that erosion of (market) share would be more than offset by the continued growth of the business,"" Jacobs said. Australian telecommunications analysts welcomed the result, but described post-deregulation as a ""big unknown"" for Optus. ""The rest of this year looks all right, but the big question mark is next year, with all the new players coming into the market. It's hard to know what effect it is going to have on Optus,"" one Sydney-based analyst said. Market analysts expect global operators such as British Telecom and the U.S. giant AT&amp;T to enter a deregulated Australian market later this year. Optus was set up in 1992 as a partial deregulation of the local market, which was previously a government monopoly. The Sydney-based group is 25 percent owned by Australian transport group Mayne Nickless Ltd and 24.5 percent each owned by Cable and Wireless Plc of Britain and U.S. telephone carrier BellSouth Corp Inc. The remainder is owned by Australian institutions. ","KevinMorrison"
"Talks between Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workers will resume with the help of a federal mediator, the parties said Friday, almost a year and a half after striking workers returned to the work at the heavy machinery maker. No date has been set for the talks called by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The talks would be the first formal negotiations since November 1995, when a tentative agreement, subsequently rejected, was submitted to UAW members. The 17-month strike ended in December 1995 without a new contract. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar's workers have been without a contract since 1991. Neither Caterpillar nor the union would say if any specific event occurred to spur new talks. ""As a result of conversations between FMCS, UAW and Caterpillar, I have called a meeting of the parties for a discussion of the issues between them,"" John Calhoun Wells, FMCS director, said in a statement. A union official said jobs and job security have been main issues throughout negotiations, while almost 400 unfair labour practice complaints by the UAW and seniority problems have also become issues. ""I've always felt that there's going to come a time when it would make a good business decision for the company"" to reach a labour agreement, Jim Clingan, executive vice president of UAW local 974 in Peoria, said. But he added that he did not know if that time has been reached. Caterpillar has reported record profits in the wake of the strike and analysts have said the continuing labour woes have had little, if any, impact on the company's bottom line. ""(Caterpillar is) not going to budge enough for it to make a difference,"" said J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. ""Even if they get a contract, it's not going to look very different than what those guys are working under now."" Caterpillar reported profit of $1.4 billion on revenues of $16.52 billion in 1996. In a statement, Cateprillar vice president Wayne Zimmerman called the resumption of meetings ""a positive development."" ""It's long past time to resolve the uncertainty this dispute has created for our employees,"" Zimmerman said. UAW president Stephen Yokich also welcomed Wells' announcement. ""It is clearly in the best interests of all stakeholders, including communities and families, that the long-standing labour dispute be resolved equitably,"" Yockich said in a statement. Caterpillar shares rose $2.625 to $93.375 in line with other capital equipment makers. Brumley noted that when the news of the announcement was made, Caterpillar shares traded lower briefly.

"Lawyers acting for Peter Young, the fund manager suspended last week by Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), said on Monday there were no grounds for allegations of criminality and there had been no such allegation in the proceedings which had been served on him. ""There is no allegation of criminality in the proceedings which have been served on Peter Young and there would be no grounds whatsoever for any such allegation,"" solicitors Peters &amp; Peters said in a statement. Young was suspended when MGAM, a subsidiary of German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG, said it had found ""suspected irregularities"" in three of its funds, two of which were managed by him. Young, whose personal assets were frozen after MGAM and fund trustee Royal Bank of Scotland obtained an injunction, has not been available for comment. Trading in the funds was halted last Monday but resumed on Thursday after a 180 million pounds ($280.7 million) cash injection by Deutsche Bank and reassurances that investors would not lose out. The problems centre on the valuation of the high proportion of unlisted high-technology stocks held in the funds. They are being investigated by British investments watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO). Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which prosecutes major financial crimes has taken no official action. It has been in contact with IMRO, but has so far only been kept briefed on developments and denies a criminal investigation is underway. The probe into what took place within MGAM is widely expected to take some time, with a complex web of holdings and companies around the world to be unravelled. Both MGAM and IMRO have drafted in forensic accountants to look into the fund management business of the three funds, MGAM has enlisted Ernst &amp; Young and IMRO Deloitte Touche. MGAM has also appointed law firm Slaughter &amp; May to help untangle a labyrinth of investments. Slaughter &amp; May confirmed its appointment but would not comment on the investigation. The fall-out of the episode for Deutsche Bank continued on Monday with the news from credit rating agency Moody's that it is looking at the bank's rare and treasured triple-A credit rating in the light of the MGAM situation. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the bank's investment banking arm, said redemptions from the funds had dropped by over half on Monday compared to the 83 million pounds redeemed last Friday and the 110 million pounds which flooded out last Thursday. ""Just under 39 million pounds was redeemed today,"" DMG spokesman James Murray told Reuters. ""As expected the redemptions have slowed down significantly. There is still enough cash left in the funds."" ""What we are seeing is a stabilisation."" He said there had been just over 300 million pounds in the funds after the Deutshe cash injection and there would be sufficient cash.if redemptions continued to drop. Murray confirmed that investors would be compensated, but that the amount would only be decided after the investigation. ""If compensation is found to be due then it will be paid by us,"" he said, adding that it would be calculated by an independent accountant appointed by IMRO. He said the preliminary part of MGAM's investigation would take between four and six weeks. ($1=.6412 Pound) ","AlexanderSmith"
"A dispute over the future of civil liberties in Hong Kong has prompted Britain and the United States to issue stern warnings to China to respect a treaty pledge to preserve basic freedoms. The quarrel flared after a Beijing-controlled panel last Sunday proposed scrapping Hong Kong laws on civil liberties and elections, including part of its Bill of Rights, when China takes over Britain's last important colony on July 1. As London and Washington aired their warnings, China said it was an internal affair and Hong Kong's future leader tried to dampen this latest controversy over Chinese post-handover plans. China is moving to replace the elected Legislative Council with a provisional legislature and to block a lenient British law that would exclude China-style crackdowns on dissent. China's opponents say these steps fly in the face of vows that allow Hong Kong to keep its freedoms after it becomes a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. The United States said it was deeply concerned about attempts to water down civil liberties in Hong Kong, and called for reconsideration. ""We are deeply concerned over any attempt to weaken civil liberties and basic freedoms in Hong Kong,"" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. Hong Kong's post-colonial leader, Tung Chee-hwa, who takes over from Governor Chris Patten on July 1, called for calm. ""I think we are being too dramatic,"" Tung told Hong Kong radio. ""It is a very complex issue,"" he said, adding that he would make a fuller statement on the affair on Thursday. Patten, however, continued the war of words. He said the ""ill-considered recommendations"" would be ""deleterious for our economic success and social stability"". ""For those two qualities are intimately related to our civil liberties, each nourishing the other,"" he told a gathering of ethnic minorities. Britain's minister for Hong Kong, Jeremy Hanley, summoned the Chinese ambassador in London to protest. A Foreign Office spokesman said the proposals were without justification. He said the Bill of Rights was consistent with both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which is the treaty governing Hong Kong's handover, and with the Basic Law, the post-handover constitution promulgated by China. The issue was being hotly debated in Hong Kong, with some analysts predicting a backlash should China roll back basic freedoms in the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people. ""The Preparatory Committee's decision, if carried through, will certainly add to the number of political trials that greet the birth of the SAR,"" said political analyst C.K. Lau. ""Should the outcome of those trials be politically unpopular, more and not fewer demonstrations and rallies are likely. This will be bad for Hong Kong's international image at a critical time."" A leading law expert, Nihal Jayawickrama of Hong Kong University, said the proposals would restore old laws, which had once been applied by colonial authorities against China's supporters, to crack down on China's opponents. ""I think the intention is to use this against elements that have emerged in Hong Kong in the recent past...It will be used to control public expression,"" Jayawickrama told Reuters. He said that by restoring the old Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance that imposed restrictions on the freedom of association, China would be turning back the clock in Hong Kong by two or three decades.

"JAMtv, a six-month-old online company started by a Chicago music promoter, hopes to turn the personal computer into a personalized jukebox. As a first step, the company will unveil on Monday a music network on the Internet using multimedia technology from Intel Corp.. JAMtv plans to broadcast live concerts, link with radio stations for other programming, sell CDs and other merchandise and provide daily news and reviews. The company is also working with privately held BackWeb, one of the leading ""push"" technology companies, which broadcasts personalized news and information directly to a person's PC. ""The goal is that you will have your own personal jukebox on your computer,"" Howard Tullman, chief executive of JAMtv, said. JAMtv spun out from Jam Productions Ltd, a well-known concert producer and promoter in Chicago whose co-founder, Jerry Mickelsen, is chairman. The company hopes its network will become the main source of music on the Internet, featuring contemporary and alternative rock arists and eventually country and jazz. But JAMtv is not trying to be the MTV of the Internet, Tullman stressed. He noted that in recent years MTV has had to change its programming to offer more shows and features, like the ""Real World"" soap opera, because MTV viewers tired of someone else making their programming decisions for them. ""It's a network of one,"" Tullman said of the planned JAMtv service. ""Anytime you go there, you can listen to what you want. You don't have to wait for someone to make these programming decisions for you,"" he said. ""We will let you design your profile and what you want."" He said the JAMtv site on the World Wide Web will have daily events, with a calender of more than 1,500 events already planned for this year based on upcoming Jam Productions events, such as a U2 concert in Soldier Field in Chicago as part of the group's tour. Users of the JAMtv site can also buy from a catalog of more than 140,000 music CDs, 70,000 music and entertainment videos and access an archive of images, audio, video and other data on hundreds of artists. Tullman also said JAMtv was talking to computer makers and to Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Commuications Corp. in an effort in get a spot on the Windows desktop and a part of the Netscape browser, so that users will be able to simply click on an icon and have their JAMtv. JAMtv is also embracing Intel's ""hybrid"" method of sending fat audio and video files over the Internet, by providing users with compact disks of some audio and video, which is then supplemented by updated audio and video streams sent over the Internet. The company hopes to make money is several ways, by selling merchandise over the Internet, by selling advertising and licensing fees to radio affiliates for programming and through compiling databases on subscribers which it could sell to record companies. Ultimately, Tullman said, a big JAMtv revenue stream will come from a ""pay-per-view"" distribution of live concerts on the Internet. ""At the end of the day, when you can truly go home at night and click on your PC and watch any concert you want, there will be pay per view revenues in this business,"" Tullman said.

"Investment banking giant Merrill Lynch on Wednesday took another step in building up its presence in the European equities markets with the purchase of an equities research and sales boutique in Italy. The U.S. powerhouse's takeover of the Milan-based Carnegie Italia SpA follows a similar but larger move earlier this year in Spain when it bought FG Inversiones, the country's largest independent brokerage, for 3.7 billion pesetas ($29.5 million). Merrill, which last year bought British equities specialist Smith New Court, said in a statement that the head of Carnegie Italia's team Tony Morrongiello would ""spearhead Merrill Lynch's local institutional equity sales presence in Milan"". This would be in partnership with Merrill's existing Italian equity sales, research and trading teams in London, it added. Paul Roy, Merril's head of equity sales and trading in Europe, said the move would give the firm ""tremendous leverage in this important market"" and enable better client service. ""We will also be better placed to offer strategic advice to Italian companies on local and international equity markets,"" Roy said in a statement. The chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe, Christopher Reeves, said Italy had been identified as a growth area for the firm in equities, debt markets, private and investment banking. Swedish stockbroker Carnegie said it had agreed to sell Merrill its Italian operations because it needed capital to expand in the Nordic region. It recently sold its operations in Spain and said it would also pull out of Portugal. Neither party disclosed what Merrill would pay for the Italian operation, although given the small size of the operation the amount was not believed to be large. Along with other investment banks, Merrill has until now ""parachuted"" relevant people in from London and New York when it has needed to wrap-up investment banking deals in European countries where it does not have an equity broking presence. Analysts said that buying small firms in Europe and building local bases rather than employing a top-down approach from one core centre underlined the need for local relationships, particularly in areas such as corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings (IPOs).

"Dozens of Japanese banks may close their foreign operations in the next few years as their huge problem loans make it hard to meet new capital requirements, analysts say. Two of Japan's top 20 banks have already announced they will shut down their overseas branches, and some analysts say many others should follow suit, delivering possible boosts to profitability. ""Japanese banks must cut unprofitable assets overseas to boost return on equity,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc. ""All that many of them are doing overseas is providing services to Japanese customers, rather than doing business with local customers in host countries. They are doing Japanese business even in overseas markets."" He said that over the next few years, the number of Japanese banks operating abroad could fall to about a third of the current 85. There are a total of 149 banks in Japan. Earlier this month, two of Japan's most troubled banks, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB) and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd announced restructuring plans that included pulling out of overseas operations. Hokkaido also said it would merge with regional bank Hokkaido Bank Ltd. Hokkaido Bank closed its overseas offices last year, saying they were not profitable. Financial authorities, worried that Japan's banking problems could destabilise global financial markets, do not object to Japanese banks closing overseas. Sei Nakai, senior deputy director-general of the Finance Ministry's banking bureau, recently told Reuters the ministry had proposed the step to NCB and Hokkaido Takushoku to avoid the possibility of Japanese banks troubling foreign creditors. He also said the ministry might tell other Japanese banks to retreat ""quietly"" from their overseas operations if they were in trouble. Analysts say tougher capital adequacy requirements scheduled to be introduced from the end of March 1998 under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) could encourage Japanese banks to close their international operations. James Fiorillo, a financial analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd, said some Japanese banks were expected to try to boost their capital to meet the BIS requirements. But others would likely take a second look at continuing internationally. Under BIS capital adequacy requirements set in the late 1980s, Japanese banks operating internationally need capital equivalent to a minimum of 8.0 percent of risk-weighted assets. In 1995, the BIS set second-stage guidelines that factor in market risk when determining capital requirements. This means Japanese banks operating abroad will have to take into account risks from activities such as foreign exchange transactions and swaps when calculating adequacy ratios from this fiscal year. Some analysts calculate that the introduction of these second-stage guidelines could cut international capital adequacy ratios of Japanese banks by up to 0.3 percent. Katsuhiro Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Center, said major commercial, trust and long-term credit banks and big regional banks would not abandon overseas operations. But smaller regional banks burdened by problem loans would do so as their low credit ratings had made it increasingly expensive for them to raise capital, he said. Sasajima said some Japanese banks would likely seek foreign partners in order to maintain their services abroad. Earlier this month, NCB said it would tie up with Bankers Trust New York Corp to help turn some of its loans into cash and to maintain services to overseas customers. ","FumikoFujisaki"
"A Wal-Mart store in Canada is set to become the first-ever unionized outlet for the world's largest retailer. The Ontario Labour Relations Board decided late on Tuesday to certify the retail/wholesale division of the United Steelworkers of America at the store in Windsor, Ontario, across the U.S.-Canada border from Detroit. The ruling came despite a May 10, 1996 vote by Windsor store employees rejecting a union drive by 151-43. But the tribunal, which administers labour laws in Canada's most populous province, ruled that Wal-Mart executives used unfair labour practices by refusing to tell employees if they would shut the store if it became unionized. Van Horne said the board rejected a second vote at the store because it felt workers would still be reluctant to vote freely because of a perceived threat to their jobs or benefits. Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which has 136 stores in Canada and more than 3,000 worldwide, has defeated every drive to unionize its stores since its founding in 1962. Wal-Mart came to Canada in 1994 and is now the country's biggest discount retail chain. United Steelworkers representative Pat Van Horne said the board's decision could pave the way for more unionized Wal-Marts in Canada. ""Obviously this is a good precedent for us,"" Van Horne said. But Wal-Mart Canada spokesman Ed Gould disagreed, saying: ""Many people will take a look at the process by which the expressed will of individuals can be denied and think twice"" about unions. Van Horne said the next step was to negotiate a contract with Wal-Mart. ""The proving ground for the union will be our ability to get a collective agreement that satisfies the employees,"" Van Horne said. Wal-Mart's Gould said the company might appeal the ruling. ""We're going to review the reasons and then we're going to consider the next steps and that could include obviously an appeal,"" Gould said. Gould ruled out abandoning the Windsor outlet. ""We are not in business to close stores."" Windsor employees earn about C$8.30 ($6.14) an hour plus profit-sharing and performance-based bonuses, Gould said. ","LydiaZajc"
"Toronto's key stock index set new highs on Wednesday, powered by glittering gold stocks as gold futures soared on precious metal markets.

Analysts said the sale, which could free Unilever up for a major acquisition in its main food, detergents and personal products businesses, was well timed. FitzGerald said, meanwhile, that the overall economic situation in 1997, as in 1996, was likely to be generally favourable for the group, which is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, with activities from food to toiletries and household goods brands such as soap powder Omo. But he saw little reason to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, would improve. Analysts' forecasts for pre-tax profit had centred on 2.53 billion pounds and Unilever Plc shares surged 86-1/2 pence to 1,479-1/2 in London as some looked to raise 1997 forecasts. In Amsterdam its shares rose 19.0 guilders, six percent, to 332.40. ""We will now seek actively buyers for the totality or the individual (chemicals) businesses and we will then assess those over the next month or two,"" FitzGerald told Reuters. ""We would hope to conclude a sale in the course of the next three to six months."" FitzGerald declined to say how much the businesses, with 15,800 staff in more than 35 countries, might be worth. Analysts estimate the sale sould fetch 4.5 to 5.0 billion pounds and FitzGerald told a news conference in the short term it would wipe out the company's net borrowings of 1.7 billion pounds. The funds would also be used for acquisitions in growth areas, FitzGerald told reporters, such as Asia Pacific and South America and in priority categories like detergents, tea, ice cream, yellow fats, personal care products and fragrances. ""We have a carefully defined list of what we may do with (the proceeds), which I am not prepared to discuss,"" he said. ""In China I would like to have a business 10 times the size."" The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have a combined turnover of 3.0 billion pounds, nine percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million in 1996, with margins of 14.1 percent. ""These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require,"" FitzGerald said. ""...if you look at the way this industry is developing we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business which is our mainstream consumer goods business."" Commenting on the overall results, Unilever said its performance in Europe was held back by poor weather hitting ice cream sales and by the impact of the mad cow disease crisis. But good progress in North American market conditions provided the basis for better results there and the momentum of growth continued strongly in the fast-growing emerging markets. Unilever Plc is paying a final dividend of 21.76 pence, making 32.05 for the year, a rise of nine percent. The Dutch arm raised the final dividend to 4.75 guilders from 4.71, making a total of 6.98 against 6.19 in 1995. ($1=.6120 Pound) ","TimFarrand"
"The judge who oversaw the dismantling of the old Ma Bell is worried that a corporate marriage involving the new AT&amp;T Corp. could create the kind of ""monolith"" the historic breakup was supposed to do away with. Federal Judge Harold Greene in 1982 ordered that the Bell system monopoly be split up. For more than a decade he then presided over the consent agreement that created the seven regional Baby Bell phone companies and the new AT&amp;T, the nation's No. 1 long-distance carrier. AT&amp;T now is in talks to merge with SBC Communications Inc. -- currently the largest provider of local phone service -- in what would be an estimated $50 billion-plus transaction. It would by far and away be the biggest such deal in history. ""The basic assumption of the breakup was that you couldn't have competition, fair competition, as long as there was this massive company that encompassed all areas of the country and all types of service,"" Judge Greene told Reuters. ""And the same theory that led to the breakup,"" he added, ""could lead one to be suspicious at least of the reemergence of the same monolith."" Judge Greene -- now more of an observer of the telecom business rather than an overseer -- frets that market conditions have not changed that much since the breakup of the Bell monopoly and the consent decree that took effect in 1984. The decree set limits on how the phone industry operated. He believes competition has yet to take full root, despite last year's telecommunications act that tore down decades-old barriers and let the local and long-distance phone companies and cable-television operators enter each other's business. ""There are lots of things that need to be done yet -- both to get the long-distance companies into local service, and local companies into long-distance service. Nothing is perfected yet,"" Judge Greene said. ""It seems kind of surprising that they would now reconstitute the AT&amp;T empire, at least in one part,"" he added. ""I would hope that regulators -- the Federal Communications Commission and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice -- will be very cautious in approving something like that. Judge Greene's policing duties in the telecom business ended with the new communications act. Since the law's passage, there has been an explosion in merger activity. SBC recently acquired former Baby Bell Pacific Telesis Group. Bell Atlantic Corp. is in the process of acquiring NYNEX Corp. And British Telecommunications Plc is in the midst of buying No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp. It's reported that a merger of AT&amp;T and San Antonio, Texas-based SBC would have combined revenues of some $80 billion and a workforce of 240,000. SBC's regional phone system includes California and Texas, following the carrier's purchase of PacTel. ""I'm surprised that somebody wants to put Humpty Dumpty back together,"" said Judge Green, adding that any new corporate monolith would run counter to the intent of the new telecom law. ""Certainly I think it was the spirit of the act that there not be a return to monopoly conditions,"" he said. ","RogerFillion"
"British retail chain Kingfisher Plc said on Friday it would axe 1,200 jobs from the Norweb retail chain it bought in November 1996 and shut stores to integrate the purchase with its Comet electrical chain. In a statement, Kingfisher said it would close 28 Norweb retail stores, which also sell electrical goods, along with 26 Comet stores and upgrade Comet out-of-town stores to raise the total number nationwide to 250 from a current 225 sites. A further 26 Norweb retail stores in locations new to Comet would become Comet stores, Kingfisher said in a statement. It added that Comet would go ahead with plans announced by Norweb retail last year before it was taken over to close all the chain's 57 high street sites at the beginning of March. A further 26 Norweb retail stores in locations new to Comet will become Comet stores, Kingfisher said in a statement. Norweb's total workforce before the job cuts numbers about 2,800. ""This acquisition is a good strategic move and will provide Comet with a significant number of first class retail locations and experienced people,"" said Kingfisher chief executive Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy. Kingfisher bought Norweb retail for 51 million pounds ($85.30 million) from United Utilities, which had taken over regional electricity company Norweb around a year ago. Kingfisher also announced on Friday that it had issued a 200 million pound bond, which analysts said was likely to be used for restructuring debt. But some said the issue could focus attention again on reports earlier this week Kingfisher might increase its stake in French electrical retailer BUT, although BUT described an article in Thursday's Financial Times as ""unfounded."" ""The bond issue doesn't surprise me as it will help to restructure debt. But it will certainly focus attention on the BUT stake again,"" said one analyst who declined to be named. Kingfisher declined to comment on the report on Thursday and there was no-one available to comment on Friday. Kingfisher already holds a 26 percent stake in BUT and the Financial Times said on Thursday it was planning to mount a takeover offer, which the newspaper estimated could cost up to 300 million pounds. Kingfisher bought the stake in BUT, which is France's second biggest furniture chain and fourth largest electricals group last year for 59 million pounds. Under the deal, it should have to wait until 1998 before making any offer but analysts suggested this might be adjusted if Kingfisher were interested in raising its stake. Analysts said such a move would be beneficial to Kingfisher. ""It would certainly be earnings enhancing in the first year,"" the analyst said. He said Kingfisher would reap benefits from integrating BUT stores with its French electrical retailer Darty, which is the market leader. ""Darty is star quality on electricals with higher returns on sales than Dixons,"" the British electrical retail chain, said the analyst. ""Combining the two could boost returns on BUT's electricals, which has turnover of around 500 million pounds but makes little profit,"" he added. But analysts remained cautious that such a deal might be in the offing. ""I don't think it will happen this year, I think they might have to wait until 1998,"" said one sector analyst.

"U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to visit China in late February in a trip aimed at further improving ties that have warmed rapidly in recent months, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday. ""China places great importance on this visit,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing. Albright would hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and a wide range of issues was expected to be discussed, Shen said. Albright's first visit as Secretary of State comes at a time when relations between China and the United States are warming swiftly, with U.S. Vice President Al Gore reported to be preparing to visit Beijing in late March. U.S. President Bill Clinton met China's President Jiang Zemin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila last November and the two agreed on an exchange of presidential visits, the first since early 1989. ""A major topic of the meeting of the two foreign ministers will be how to push forward relations on the basis of the presidential meeting,"" Shen said of Albright's visit. Former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to China last November on a fence-mending visit that both sides hailed as a major step in repairing ties ravaged by disputes for well over a year. The announcement of Albright's China trip coincides with a flurry of visits by U.S. officials to Beijing. A U.S. human rights team led by Sandra Kristoff, the National Security Council's chief Asia expert, and including Peter Eicher, director of the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, was to conclude two days of talks in Beijing on Thursday. The U.S. team was in China on the eve of the release of Washington's annual worldwide human rights report that once again slams Beijing's record. This year's report says that by the end of 1996 there were almost no active dissidents left in China who had not been jailed or exiled. Officials said the team would seek concessions from Beijing on human rights that could make it unnecessary this year for Washington to co-sponsor a United Nations resolution critical of China's policy. Albright has vowed to confront Beijing on its human rights record, trade issues and weapon sales abroad -- all thorns in Sino-U.S. ties -- but says relations between the two Pacific giants cannot be held hostage to any one issue. China on Wednesday told Clinton not to worry about Chinese human rights and Hong Kong's future freedoms, saying Beijing's rights record spoke for itself and liberty in the British colony was assured. Clinton said on Tuesday that Washington had made less progress than hoped in influencing Chinese rights policies and warned that Hong Kong's value to China might fall if liberties in the colony were lost after it returns to Beijing rule. Senior U.S. trade official Lee Sands began talks in Beijing on Thursday to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of cross-Pacific friction. Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry. Top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes was also in Beijing for talks to hammer out a new textile accord with negotiations seen extending right up to a Friday deadline for agreement. ","MureDickie"
"Increasing signs of an economic upswing in China have raised the question of how far speculation can be held responsible for a sudden flush of liquidity sweeping through China-related stocks in Hong Kong. Brokerage W.I. Carr on Thursday said that improving economic fundamentals in China could be at least partly responsible for the red chip fever that has fuelled Hong Kong's outperforming stock market for months. Dismissing any suggestion of a speculative bubble ripe for collapse, it said the soaring rally in Hong Kong red chips, or companies with financial backing in China, confirmed the beginning of a long and strong business cycle in China. ""The market is telling us something about where the Chinese economy is going and where company earnings in China are going in the future,"" said John Mulcahy, managing director of Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities in Hong Kong. Red chips have gained on expectations of big returns from strong connections and asset injections by parents, often municipal and provincial governments. Many are trading at more than 35 times 1997 earnings, compared with the average Hong Kong blue chip ratio of 15. Much of the rally is driven more by ""a wish and promise"" than evident earnings performance but growing signs of economic recovery in China suggest economic fundamentals could also be playing a role, Mulcahy said. Corporate restructuring, rising productivity, disinflation and strong exports are far more responsible for strong Chinese markets than a sudden burst of liquidity from central bank credit easing last year, said economist Michael Taylor. ""Just as in other bull markets, this market is probably telling us something,"" Taylor said. ""And I believe the evidence is coherently pointing to ... the start of a long, sustained business cycle here based on restructuring and being characterised by disinflation and good trade performance,"" he said. But Dong Tao, senior regional economist at Schroder Securities, disagreed. He said market rallies in Hong Kong and on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges were being driven by liquidity seeking better returns than those offered by a depressed Chinese industrial sector. ""I don't think a turnaround in company profits will arrive this year. I haven't seen a turnaround in demand. I haven't seen that the price wars hurting companies' bottom lines are over,"" Tao said. China's economy is currently split between a struggling real economy, dominated by debt-laden and loss-making state-owned enterprises, and excessive liquidity, he said. Timing is the key, Tao said. China is still struggling with flat domestic demand and huge overcapacity following the 30-percent growth rates in fixed asset investment that marked the booming early 1990s -- but that will end at some point. Taylor argued that improvements are already surfacing, with cuts of up to 15 percent of the workforce in places such as Shanghai linked to rising productivity -- boding well for an early improvement in corporate earnings growth. But the risk of disinflation throughout Asia threatens to undermine China's gains and puts pressure on exporters to stimulate the real economy, Taylor said. Chinese media recently reported that exports are not expected to maintain the 26.9 percent growth rate recorded between January and April this year. China's focus on exports to solve its economic problems has excerbated political tensions, with the China-U.S. trade surplus expected to exceed US$50 billion this year compared to about US$40 billion last year. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6470 ","SarahDavison"
"Wall Street's year-old love affair with IBM showed signs of fraying Wednesday after investors felt jilted by the computer maker's fourth-quarter earnings report. International Business Machines Corp. stock tumbled $13 in early trading and closed $10 lower at $158 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most active issue with more than 12.2 million shares changing hands. The drop contributed accounted for most of the decline of nearly 34 points in the Dow Jones industrial average, which includes IBM in its 30 stocks. It had some market pundits wondering if the issues affecting IBM's profits in the quarter point to a broader slowdown in corporate earnings this year that could mean an end to the stock market's stellar rally. The world's largest computer maker late on Tuesday said fourth quarter earnings rose 18 percent to $2 billion, or $3.93 a share, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $3.88 a share but falling short of more optimistic forecasts. In fact, several analysts said they were disappointed with the results, which were boosted by a lower tax rate and lower-than-expected restructuring costs, but hurt by sluggish mainframe sales and currency fluctuations. ""This quarter took the wind out of their sails,"" said Daniel Ries, a Nomura Research analyst. ""Rather than easily achieve (Wall) Street estimates, IBM appeared to be huffing and puffing,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich said in a note to clients. IBM stock more than doubled in the last year, aided late in the year by Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh, who in November raised his price target for IBM stock to $195. On Wednesday Mandresh cut his 1997 earnings estimate for IBM to $13 a share from $13.40, traders said. Mandresh did not return calls seeking comment. But traders said he reiterated his buy rating on the stock and the $195 price target. For all of 1996, IBM earned $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share. While IBM's service business continued to perform well in the fourth quarter -- revenues there grew 22 percent -- mainframe sales were disappointing and its microelectronics unit was hurt by a drop in computer memory chip prices. In addition, sales of RS/6000 workstations were flat. ""It was disappointing in a number of dimensions, partly hardware growth and the gross margin being low,"" said Painewebber analyst Stephen Smith, who reiterated what he called a controversial ""unattractive"" rating on IBM. Smith said he expected less profits from mainframes, IBM's traditional stronghold, in 1997 than in 1996. John Jones of Salomon Brothers said mainframe sales fell 12 percent in the quarter, with 10 percent of those revenues coming from IBM's older less profitable machines that are being discontinued. Not every analyst saw the earnings report as negative. ""Hardware is the thing that was off the mark,"" said SoundView Financial analyst Gary Helmig, who cited ""some good news underneath"" and reiterated a buy rating on IBM. Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff said he held his attractive rating on IBM shares and kept his 1997 estimate of $12.75 a share unchanged. Some market analysts said the issues surrounding IBM could foreshadow problems for corporate earnings, and stock prices, down the road. One issue is the strength of the dollar, which IBM said ate into fourth quarter revenue growth by 3 percentage points. ""The strong dollar is something I think is going to impact earnings for many multinationals,"" said Edgar Peters, chief investment strategist at PanAgora Asset Management. ""That's something that hasn't been talked about much before today."" The strong dollar can hurt U.S. companies in two ways: profits from overseas are worth less when translated into dollars and companies have a harder time raising prices since foreign competitors have the advantage of a weaker currency. ""It means the pricing power of domestic corporations is hurt,"" said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ""This foreshadows the real problem of 1997 because one of the pillars of this market has been earnings growth."" The dollar, recently at its highest level in years against the German mark and Japanese yen, shows few signs of retreating. Still, some said Wednesday's IBM sell-off was overdone. ""I think there was a lot of retail panic selling,"" Soundview's Helmig said, referring to sales by customers of retail brokerages as opposed to institutional investors. David Takata of Gruntal &amp; Co. raised his price target on IBM to $200. ""1997 looks like IBM's year of execution,"" he said. ","TheresePoletti"
"Racal Electronics Plc, the defence to communications group hit by a profit warning on Monday which flagged poor interim results on Tuesday, has blamed last minute delays in foreign government defence orders hitting its revenue targets.

The defence orders were earmarked for the radio division which provides defence related equipment to foreign governments.

"An American businessman is plotting a marketing revolution in the hospitality sector and aims to house U.S. pioneers in the China market. Corporate housing specialist Howard Ruby says he aims to turn the business of letting serviced apartments into a full-fledged industry that will provide everything from Internet terminals in the home to child care and jobs for expatriate spouses. FROM POOR COUSIN OF HOTELS TO A GLOBAL SERVICE Until recently the sector providing ready-to-live-in, service-provided, short-term apartments was a poor cousin of hotels, and in many cities of the world it still is. ""This whole industry has been below the radar screen over the last twenty years, being done by a mama and papa, or a small operator that operates one building at a time,"" said Ruby. ""And now we're seeing an industry evolve because of the needs of corporate clients as business globalises around the world,"" the head of Los Angeles-based Oakwood International said in an interview at a recent hotel industry conference. EYES ON ASIA AND CHINA MARKETS Ruby's group recently launched a joint venture with a subsidiary of Australia-listed Lend Lease in Singapore with plans to provide 10,000 serviced apartments in Asia, and intends to take aim at London during the next year. Ruby foresees large-scale expansion in the sector in the Far East, especially in China, with much of American industry abuzz with plans to move people into the region. Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have large expatriate populations as well as large numbers of home-grown professionals moving around the country on assignment who need temporary serviced housing. ""I just finished a tour of major client companies in the United States. Every single one is planning an expansion into the Far East, with most of them talking about China. ""Telecommunications, software companies, all the way through to clothing and furniture manufacturers. They're all talking China right now. Whereas a company might have sent 10 people last year, they're expecting to send over 20 people this coming year,"" he said. The serviced apartment industry is starting to break away from the niche market identity and family-style business of old into a multifaceted service industry, Ruby believes. CORPORATE RELOCATIONS PROVIDE HUGE MARKET POTENTIAL Oakwood is the largest national provider of serviced apartments in the United States, with offices in 60 cities, more than 17,000 apartments and 25,000 clients including 400 of the Fortune 500 companies and 75 of the world's top multinationals. The potential of the business is highlighted by one client that carries out 50,000 relocations of staff a year, with an average three months stay in temporary housing, Ruby said. A company like General Motors, for example, might need help with relocation or temporary housing for staff moved around on training, special projects like setting up new production lines and might put out 25,000 apartment requirements a year. Ruby started out catering to the niche market of new college graduates three decades ago -- apartments for baby boomers. He moved on to corporate housing when companies asked for more services, such as maid service and taking care of bills. SERVICED APARTMENTS TO BECOME MULTIFACETED SERVICE He sees the business progressing to include video conferencing, Internet hookups, sports and recreation facilities, orientation tours, child care and job search agencies for spouses. ""This way a serviced apartment offers a branded service dedicated to the needs of the corporate customer. They are not just a physical facility, but a service provider,"" he said. ""Companies do not want staff transfers to end in failure because of a dissatisfied spouse. So we want to provide a service that makes a transfer a success."" With an increasingly cluttered market, customers looked now to a reputable brand as their one point of contact, Ruby said. DEALS IN THE PIPELINE IN ASIA In the Far East, Oakwood and partners are working on deals in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manila and Bangkok. The first Asian project to go onstream will be Oakwood Premier, a serviced apartment scheme in Shanghai's historic Xuhui district, where the French concession was located in pre-revolutionary times. The property, owned by a Hong Kong family, will open later this year. ""As the industry matures in Asia, dedicated service companies will be the providers of choice for the corporations leasing the majority of serviced apartments,"" Ruby said. ","PeterHumphrey"
"General Mills Inc, the number-two U.S. cereal maker with a roughly 27-percent market share, said Wednesday it expects record performance in fiscal 1997. ""We expect to finish the year with record earnings, record volume and record market share,"" General Mills Chairman Stephen Sanger said in an interview here after a presentation at an analysts' conference.   In fiscal 1996, Minneapolis-based General Mills earned $3.00 a share with sales of $5.42 billion. The company also reaped seven percent domestic volume growth and 13 percent international volume growth in fiscal 1997. For the first nine months of the year, General Mills, which makes cereals, Betty Crocker baking mixes, Hamburger Helper skillet dinner mixes, fruit snacks and yogurt, is expected to reach its volume target of four percent growth, Sanger added.   As previously reported, General Mills expects a recent decline in cereal prices will reduce earnings for fiscal 1997, which ends in May, by about $0.20 a share. Its recently completed acquisition of the branded cereal and snacks business of Ralcorp Holdings Inc, as previously disclosed, is expected to reduce earnings by about $0.05 a share. In the first half of fiscal 1997, General Mills posted a profit of $1.80 a share, up one percent, and sales of $2.88 billion, up six percent. Earnings in the first half were relatively flat, Sanger said, partly because of the cereal price reduction, while sales benefited from some strong promotion. ""The second half will be a bit of the flip of that with modest volume growth, but stronger earnings,"" Sanger said. Looking ahead, Sanger said General Mills' goal continues to be to grow earnings per share ""over the long term,"" and to post a return on capital of at least 25 percent. ""That's certainly what our goal will be for next year,"" he added. ((Reuter Chicago newsdesk (312) 408-8787)) ","PatriciaCommins"
"General Magic Inc. Monday demonstrated components of a new service that will let people use phones, pagers and the Internet itself to keep track of schedules, electronic mail, voice mail and telephone call processing. The service, code-named Serengeti will allow mobile workers to check and respond to electronic mail and scheduling details from the road using voice commands. The system may compete with voicemail providers like Octel Communications Inc. and Siemens' Rolm systems, as well as electronic mail readers which small startups are developing, but it appears to be the first which integrates all these components into one service. For example, users can check their schedules by computer or cellular telephone, while also checking voice mail and electronic mail, and using everyday English to communicate with with the service. The service will be accessible from most devices, including desktop PCs as well as via telephones and pagers. General Magic Chairman Steve Markman said in an interview at the Upside/David Coursey Internet Showcase here that a pilot version of the service will enter testing in May and it could generate revenues later in 1997. ""Our focus is to make sure we've got the service right,"" said Markman, who unveiled the company's new business plan earlier this year and repeated that General Magic does not expect to make significant revenues from it until mid-1998. Executives declined to discuss pricing or distribution of the product, but said it would be available to individual mobile workers. Kevin Surace, who headed the Serengeti project, said it would cost less than ""hundreds of dollars."" General Magic also announced a joint technology accord with Starfish Software, Inc., which was founded in 1994 by technologists including former Borland Inc. head Philippe Kahn to develop products focused on the Internet, wireless communications and computer telephony.

"British textiles group Coats Viyella Plc is ""well placed"" for a recovery in profitablity, its retiring chief executive Neville Bain said on Thursday. Bain told Reuters in an interview following publication of results that showed a sharp fall in 1996 profits: ""We are poised for a period of growth from the base we have put in place."" He added, ""The company is well placed to move ahead in 1997 and future years, although the extent of that does depend on some factors outside our control,"" including exchange rates and economic trends.   Bain said he felt now was the right time to stand down as chief executive after 6-1/2 years, and added that he hoped to take up other directorships and chairmanships. ""We agreed at the end of last year that this would be a good time to go,"" Bain said. He said he would continue to be available to assist Coats Viyella. Bain said his successor, former McKechnie Plc chief executive Michael Ost, ""has a very good track record, and he did not expect him to change the group's strategy.   ""This year's results, in difficult circumstances, are exactly in line with expectations and the trading statement that we made at the end of last year,"" said Bain. ""Underlying profit is down by seven percent, which is a tad disappointing, but given the state of this industry that certainly would augur well in (comparison with) our peer group."" Bain said cost savings from the group's reorganisation, which led to charges of 54.9 million stg against 1996 profits, were flowing through faster than expected. Savings in 1996 totalled 12 million pounds against a prediction of 10 million stg.   Bain said he was ""confident"" that savings of at least 35 million stg would be achieved in 1998. He highlighted the performance of the group's home furnishings division, where operating profits rose 42 percent to 12.5 mllion stg, and the continued strength of fashion retail, which he said had built profits to 13.1 million stg in 1996 from around 2.0 million over the past five years. But he said the performance of clothing, where profits fell 12 percent to 19.1 million stg, ""was not satisfactory."" He said the division had been affected by disruption from restructuring, which involves relocation of a number of operations.   Bain said he was confident management ""is doing the right things to secure greater profits into the future, but it is taking us a bit longer than anticipated."" He added that group was looking for a ""significant improvement"" on the division's profit margins of between three and four percent. The core threads division, where operating profits fell 10.4 percent to 90.3 million stg, had enjoyed a stronger fourth quarter after a weak first half, Bain said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","JonathanBirt"
"The long-awaited turnaround in Australia's housing market is expected to occur during 1997 but it is unlikely to signal a repeat of the boom seen in the 1980s or the most recent peak in the 1993/94 year. Lower immigration levels Australia are seen as a major reason for the subdued demand for housing, analysts said. However the anticipated housing recovery would be welcomed by building material companies, hardware chains and consumer goods manufacturers, who have blamed the recent housing slump for a fall in profits over the past 18 months.   House construction is expected to total 127,200 homes in the 1996/97 year to June 30, up from 124,550 a year earlier, according to the government's housing forecaster, the Indicative Planning Council (IPC). However this forecast is in doubt, according to building industry body, the Master Builders Association (MBA), which has said total building approvals needed to rise by around 17 percent to meet the 1996/97 forecast. The 1996/97 forecast is well down on the 182,000 homes built in the 1993/94 high point and the 177,000 level reached in the previous peak in 1988/89.   IPC forecasts housing starts to average 138,000 a year to the 1999/2000 year.In the three years to 1993/94 homes built averaged 177,000 per year. ""The markets won't take off without a substantial push from overseas migration, which of course is not particularly popular at the moment,"" said Jim Sibree, property consultant at consultancy BIS Shrapnel. Australia has been caught-up in a debate over immigration started last year by independent politician Pauline Hanson whose call in September for a freeze on immigration appears to have struck a chord with many voters.   The Australian government expects to take in about 86,000 immigrants during 1996/97, down from 96,000 in 1995/96 and well below the levels taken in the 1980s when the intake averaged between 130,000 and 140,000 a year. The number of people leaving Australia has averaged between 27,000 and 30,000 over the past decade. Overseas migration is seen as the major determinant of growth of the housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities, both with populations of over three million.   ""Migration would have to go through the 100,000 level before it could give a major boost to the Sydney and Melbourne markets,"" Sibree told Reuters. Australia has taken about 5.5 million immigrants since the end of World War Two, representing almost a quarter of the nation's current population of 18 million. The government current population projection is about 23 million in 30 years.   Christianna Cobbold, executive director of policy at the , Housing Industry Association (HIA) said the Australian housing market was unlikely to repeat the growth it recorded over the past 20 years, since the end of the ""White Australia Policy."" ""In the longer term I don't think we are going to see the massive growth we have seen in the past 15 or 20 years. We just don't have that sort of population growth,"" Cobbold said. Cobbold said the HIA plans a study into the effects of immigration on Australia on economic, social and cultural levels. The study is expected to be completed by mid-1997. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","KevinMorrison"
"Cable &amp; Wireless Plc (C&amp;W) and the merging NYNEX Corp and Bell Atlantic Corp have one alliance already, a second is on the way, and by late 1997 they could go as far as a full merger. ""Given the U.K. cable alliance I think there is all the more reason that they will be eventual merger partners,"" said one investment banker, who declined to be identified. C&amp;W this month said it would merge its U.K. Mercury unit with three cable TV and telephone operators, including NYNEX CableComms Group, of which NYNEX owns 67 percent.   Sources close to the companies and investment bankers say this is a slow-moving and tentative embrace, with hurdles that could stop it before full merger. NYNEX's merger into Bell Atlantic will not be completed until the first quarter of 1997, and worries over C&amp;W's assets in Hong Kong will mean waiting to see how the handover to China goes in 1997. No firm decisions are likely before. However investment bankers say a desire to merge is there, noting the experience of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc (BT) which pulled together an alliance into a full merger.   ""C&amp;W and NYNEX share some common visions and some common friendships,"" said one industry source close to the firms. ""And all the things that frustrate people about loose alliances are true. But C&amp;W is a large and far-flung empire, and there are plenty of (problem) issues,"" he said. None of the three companies involved would comment. -- C&amp;W SEES NYNEX BEST BELL PARTNER -- However, C&amp;W Chief Executive Richard Brown was last week quoted by the Financial Times in London as saying that talks with NYNEX had already gone beyond the U.K. cable deal.   ""With traffic flow and multinational accounts, NYNEX makes far more sense as a partner than any other Baby Bell,"" he was quoted as saying. C&amp;W declined to elaborate on the comments. Investment bankers say C&amp;W is not big enough to crack open the U.S. business market alone, but has long distance circuits that the two Bells could use. Bell Atlantic would be a stronger U.S. brand than C&amp;W, and could funnel far more traffic onto C&amp;W's international network. C&amp;W is strong in Asia, where NYNEX's 13.5 percent TelecomAsia investment and Bell Atlantic's 24.8 percent stake in Telecom Corp of New Zealand could gain new outlets.   Bell Atlantic Chief Executive Raymond Smith, eyeing the fat margins on international calling, has left analysts in no doubt of his aim of turning the regional Bell from a powerhouse in the northeast of the U.S. into a global company. NYNEX Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg, who takes over as Bell Atlantic CEO a year after the merger is completed in the first quarter of 1997, can help him do that. -- NYNEX AND C&amp;W SEEN CLOSE TO UNDERSEA CABLE ALLIANCE -- Seidenberg is a close friend of C&amp;W's Brown and bankers say the two are near to a deal on a joint submarine cable firm combining NYNEX's Asian cable FLAG with a transatlantic cable owned by C&amp;W and MFS Communications Co Inc.   MFS is itself being taken over by WorldCom Inc, the fourth largest U.S. long distance company. Bankers say the new Bell Atlantic would be most attractive to C&amp;W, but C&amp;W's international reach may attract interest from BellSouth Corp or GTE Corp too. -- C&amp;W ONLY INTERNATIONAL CANDIDATE LEFT FOR BELLS -- Bankers say C&amp;W is almost the only candidate for any U.S. local phone company hoping to create a company equal in global scale and reach to a merged MCI and BT. Long distance carriers have moved faster. AT&amp;T Corp has its Unisource alliance with Dutch, Swedish, Spanish and Swiss carriers, while Sprint Corp has its Global One alliance with Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom.   Japan's NTT Corp, so far unallied, is being heavily wooed by BT/MCI according to sources in those firms. C&amp;W is still available for a good reason. It has a bewilderingly complex structure that makes it both hard to value and expensive to buy. BT discovered this to its cost, abandoning talks on buying C&amp;W in May this year. C&amp;W's activities include the Mercury phone network and Mercury One 2 One mobile phone operator in Britain, and Mannesmann Mobilfunk and Vebakom in Germany. Many of these are joint ventures, which would complicate a change of ownership. -- HONGKONG TELECOM IS THE BIG PRIZE, BUT BIGGEST PROBLEM --   The biggest problem concerns C&amp;W's crown jewel, its 57.5 percent stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. Any bidder for C&amp;W must make an offer for the Hong Kong Telecom minority. The total cost of a bid including this could easily top $30 billion, analysts say. Bell Atlantic and NYNEX have a pro forma market capitalization of $47 billion. ""The real wild card is how to value C&amp;W going into 1997 given the Hong Kong Telecom stake,"" an investment banker said. China's resumes sovereignty in Hong Kong from Britain next June, and worries persist on how Communist Beijing will handle this and other companies in the territory. One rumored deal is that China's ministry of Post and Telecoms would take a stake in Hongkong Telecom ahead of the transition. There are some options to bypass the complexities. A loose alliance between C&amp;W and the two Bells would be easy to construct, but would suffer the same disadvantages of lack of focus and turf battles described by BT and MCI when they decided to go for a full merger. ""They could do an operating alliance with options to turn it into an equity alliance at a later stage,"" the banker said. Another option he saw would be to create an operating company containing the simpler parts of C&amp;W in which the new Bell Atlantic would take a stake.  -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610 ","NickLouth"
"Ivorian port cocoa stocks stand at up to 175,000 tonnes as arrivals trickle in at about 1,000 tonnes a week, but April and brisk May exports will reduce levels, port sources said on Friday. ""The main season (Oct-April) is over so arrivals will be down until early May,"" said a source. ""Some exporters have stock at the margins of (export) quality limits so they will be waiting to mix it with fresh mid-crop (May-Sept)."" Sources put stocks at Abidjan at 100,000 tonnes with 75,000 at the second port of San Pedro. Exporters' agents said some exporters were short of cocoa for immediate shipment, but others said this represented a temporary commercial squeeze rather than a broader supply problem. ""Smaller exporters may have bought contracts beyond their capacity, the Caisse may have issued too many contacts or maybe a few exporters are holding large stocks,"" said one shipping manager. ""I have people crying out for cocoa,"" he added. Another agent said, ""We must wait and see if the Caisse renews export licences if contracts are broken."" Latest bean sizes were around 90-105 beans per 100 grams, against an export standard of 105 with up to eight percent humidity, industry buyers said. ""Bean sizes are tailing off now but smaller ones are still up-country,"" said one. Exporters are gearing up for mid-crop arrivals after returning from Easter holidays, but crop analysts have not completed up-country pod tallies to give an indication of volumes, they said. Early estimates range from 100,000 tonnes to well over 160,000, down on 200,000 in the 1995/96 season, crop analysts said. ""If good rains now carry on and cherelles survive through April and May, I see no reason to be pessimistic,"" said one. ""Estimates will be out later in April but most pod counters will be up-country in mid-April."" Some main crop could be held back to mix with mid-crop to reach an overall export standard. Tree crop and declared mid-crop could vary widely, he said. Warehouse stocks totalled up to 400,000 tonnes in early 1997 as exporters held back cocoa bought through auction for December contracts from the Caistab marketing body. Auction prices were out of line with world rates before a rally ahead of March contracts, they said at the time. -- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"Australia's largest shopping mall owner, Westfield Holdings Ltd, announced on Wednesday its U.S. arm would list on the New York Stock Exchange in May and raise US$400 million in an initial public offering. Westfield America Inc would then use the proceeds to go on a US$500 million shopping spree around the United States, buying out Westfield's partners in the shopping malls it already owns and buying new malls. The resulting group would then be the fourth largest listed shopping mall owner in the United States, Westfield Holdings chairman Frank Lowy said. ""We opened a little door before and now we're opening a huge door for us to expand our business in the United States,"" Lowy told a news conference. Lowy said Westfield America Trust would list its U.S. vehicle, CenterMark Properties Inc, as Westfield America Inc, diluting its 67.2 percent stake in CenterMark to about 50 percent. Westfield America would then first buy Westfield Holdings' 50 percent stake in the Garden State Plaza shopping centre in New Jersey for US$145 million. About US$210 million would then be available to buy out Westfield America's partners in shopping malls it already partly owns and to buy up new malls. Lowy told the news conference the US$210 million of equity would be combined with debt to buy out partners and new malls. ""We see borrowings of maybe US$150 million to US$200 million, which gives us an opportunity to consider acquisitions of about US$350 million altogether,"" Lowy said. Ownership of U.S. shopping malls was increasingly transferring from private or family companies into listed public companies, and Westfield's U.S. listing would help accelerate the process, he said. Lowy said many of Westfield America's partners were family concerns or closed-end funds, many of which wanted to cash in their stakes. Closed-end funds must cash in their investments after a certain period. Some were also unable to inject the extra capital needed to continually re-develop or expand the shopping malls, Lowy said. ""Some of our partners just do not have the cash, and now they have the option of watering down (their holdings) or selling out,"" Lowy said. Westfield had said last year when listing the Australian unit trust vehicle for Centermark, Westfield America Trust, that it planned to list CenterMark in the United States within five years. Lowy said strong U.S. market conditions had led to the earlier than expected listing. The offering is planned for May and is being underwritten by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co, but Lowy said the timing may change if the U.S. market slumps before then. ""If conditions change, we'll have to reassess,"" he said. Westfield officials said the U.S. listing gave the Australian-based company more flexibility when acquiring shopping malls in the United States, as it opened up access to the U.S. debt markets. The ability to offer U.S. listed shares to shopping mall owners instead of cash would also open up a new range of acquisition opportunities, as many sellers preferred shares to cash for tax reasons, they said.

"National Westminster Bank Plc on Tuesday reported a jump in operating profit but the bank's shares dipped after it warned of an economic slowdown in 1998 and did not perform an expected share repurchase. Underlying profit rose by 27 percent and NatWest, one of Britain's biggest banks, said the headline profits figure was hit by one-off items. Profit before tax was 1.12 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) after exceptional items, with operating profit from continuing operations up by 339 million to 1.61 billion pounds. The bank said it expected the pace of  British economic growth to slow in 1998, however, and as a consequence was adopting a more cautious approach to lending. ""We don't want people to get carried away by 3.5 percent (economic ) growth this year which is what me might still see,"" NatWest chief executive Derek Wanless told Reuters in an interview. ""Our belief is that whoever wins the election, rates will rise and the fiscal position could well be tighter."" He added that NatWest was putting the lending policies in place now for people who will be paying back in that economic climate. Wanless said NatWest expected British base rates to rise to 7-1/4 percent by the end of the year compared to their current six percent level. NatWest increased its general provisions against bad debts by 50 million pounds and made specific provisions of 499 million pounds. Analysts said the market would be disappointed that NatWest had not performed a further repurchase of shares following its 451 million pounds buyback last July. Wanless said NatWest will perform further share repurchases if it generates more surplus capital. Some analysts had expected NatWest to use its remaining shareholder authority to buy back 28 million shares which would have cost it some 220 million pounds but the bank made no announcement. ""If we've got surplus capital we will return it to shareholders,"" Wanless said. ""That's still the policy and will remain the policy."" He said NatWest would ask shareholders to return its buy-back mandate to 100 million shares at its AGM in April but declined to give any clues on when a repurchase might actually be performed. NatWest's pre-tax profit figure came after a loss of 719 million pounds on sale of businesses such as its U.S. banking operation Bancorp, costs of 186 million on the redesign of its UK retail bank and a gain of 224 million on the sale of its stake in venture capital company 3i. Pre-tax profits at NatWest Markets, its investment banking arm, rose to 462 million pounds from 304 million, although this included a fall in bad debt provisions to 18 million pounds from 114 million. Wanless said the group would not bid in the auction currently under way for mutually-owned life insurer Scottish Amicable but added that it was still on the look out to bolster its operations in the area of long-term savings. Wanless said NatWest UK saw a six percent rise in income and a two percent fall in costs despite the fact that it was spending large amounts on new systems. He said an additional 100 million pounds would be spent on this in 1997. NatWest is paying a final dividend of 19.4 pence, raising the total for the year by 14.6 percent to 29.0p. By 1130 GMT, NatWest shares were 25-1/2 pence lower at 787 having rallying from a low earlier of 762. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds) ","JoeOrtiz"
"French Industry Minister Franck Borotra said on Wednesday that state consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM) would get a capital injection in the next few weeks. He declined to comment on the size of the injection or whether it was in line with a prior plan for an 11 billion franc ($2 billion) payment into TMM's parent Thomson SA. Some 10 billion of that would have gone to TMM as part of a plan to privatise the company. Borotra said he also expected a decision on the sale terms of the state's 58-percent stake in defence electronics company Thomson-CSF to be taken before the end of January. Thomson-CSF is the Thomson group's other subsidiary and will be sold first under a new plan to sell the branches separately. ""It is necessary to recapitalise Thomson Multimedia in the next few weeks,"" Borotra told reporters at his traditional New Year's reception for the news media. The European Commission is conducting a formal probe into the planned state aid to TMM. In early December, the French government suspended an earlier privatisation plan for Thomson under which missiles to books conglomerate Lagardere Groupe would have bought the firm after a recapitalisation for one symbolic franc. Lagardere would have merged Thomson-CSF with its Matra Defence Espace unit and sold TMM to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea. Daewoo, which was angered by the government's decision not to go through with the sale, is probably still keen on TMM, Borotra said. French presidential envoy Jean-Claude Paye, former head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, is currently in Seoul on a mission to repair the diplomatic damage. He said on Wednesday he had urged Daewoo to bid again. ""Since Daewoo has already made a near-successful bid once, we are sure that it would be looked upon with sympathy, but of course without preference, because the process must be transparent and without prejudice,"" he said. Alcatel Alsthom is also interested in Thomson-CSF and Compagnie des Signaux has said it wants to associate itself with the new owner of Thomson-CSF, which it expects will be Lagardere. ""We have to find a solution as soon as possible. The government will announce a decision before the end of the month,"" Borotra said. ""Separating the sales of Thomson-CSF and Thomson Multimedia was a good thing. Thomson-CSF has to become the heart and the engine of the restructuring of the defence electronics and professional electronics sector,"" he added. He did not state his preference, or whether he thought Daewoo's chances were good. An independent Privatisation Commission objected to the sale of TMM to Daewoo on the grounds that there were insufficient job guarantees and because the one-franc price did not fully reflect the value of TMM's expertise in flat-screen technology and digital decoders. He indicated he would look with favour on a solution in which TMM had a few partners, with an Asian company among them. ""With the help of partners it will master its production processes and penetrate markets where it is not at present, in particular the Asian markets,"" Borotra said. He held up the example of the privatisation of computer group Compagnie des Machines Bull, which returned to the private sector in December after a two-stage privatisation to three main shareholders, France Telecom, Motorola of the United States and NEC of Japan. ""These privatisations (of Thomson-CSF and TMM) have to become successes, just as the privatisation of Bull was a success,"" Borotra said. ","MarcelMichelson"
"The stock of Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc. jumped Monday amid speculation that Harnischfeger Industries Inc. would boost its hostile $631 million takeover offer for the supplier of machine tools or that another suitor would make a bid. Analysts were sceptical that Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based machine tool and industrial automation products maker Giddings would see a much higher bid than the $19-a-share tender offer Harnischfeger announced Friday. ""I don't think there's much more in that Harnischfeger bid than what's in there, and I don't think there's anyone else out there"" that would make a higher bid, Thomas Burns Jr., analyst at NatWest Securities, said. The stock of Giddings, which also makes industrial automation equipment, soared $6.73 to $20.36 in active trading of more than 10.1 million shares on the Nasdaq market. ""People are expecting a higher bid,"" one trader said. Harnischfeger's unsolicited bid of $19 a share for Giddings has a total value of $747 million including assumption of Giddings debt. Giddings has asked its stockholders not to act on the offer until its board reviews the proposal. Giddings also said it retained Credit Suisse First Boston to explore all strategic alternatives. Many analysts think that Harnischfeger's bid will prove to be successful. While saying the Harnischfeger bid was not a done deal, ""We expect (Harnischfeger) to pursue its target with vigour and would be surprised if another offer significantly higher than the one now on the table would surface,"" J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosowrth Inc., said. Harnischfeger said it is looking at using Giddings &amp; Lewis to expand in the fragmented industrial products aftermarket service business, which Harnischfeger estimates as an $80 billion market. But some analysts said buying Giddings &amp; Lewis, a company that took a $64.1 million charge last year to try to fix its integrated automation systems business, adds a lot of uncertainty for Harnischfeger shareholders. ""...We believe that investors will be looking at a fundamentally different company with much more risk involved than they had previously,"" Brumley wrote in a research note, in which he also lowered the rating of Harnischfeger to a hold from a buy. But some analysts said Harnischfeger has picked a perfect time to go after Giddings &amp; Lewis. Giddings &amp; Lewis has already taken steps to fix its underperforming operations, but the stock, in their opinion, still is ailing, they said. ""They got all the dirty work behind them,"" said Darren Bagwell, analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co Inc. ""They've wiped the slate clean, and yet the stock price still reflects that wait and see attitude."" In fact, Bagwell also said Giddings &amp; Lewis could probably squeeze a higher bid out of somebody and said he felt the company was worth more than $19 a share. Harnischfeger Industries stock fell $3.125 to $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. ","BradDorfman"
"Gloria Cuartas is still haunted by the image of two gunmen who beheaded a child as she watched from the gates of a school in this troubled northwestern town. The men tossed the severed head toward her as she shepherded young pupils back into the classroom seconds before a rival gang arrived and a shootout erupted. That experience is at the heart of why Cuartas, the mayor of Apartado, is raising a rare voice for peace amid the drums of war that thunder across the killing fields of Uraba -- one of the most violent regions of Colombia. Since she took office in January 1995 Cuartas has battled to build an oasis of neutrality to shelter the civilian population from the crossfire of a savage war between leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and the army. ""I was visiting a school last August when two men grabbed a child behind the school. They punched him in the stomach and then cut his head off and threw it toward me,"" Cuartas told Reuters. ""There was a shootout and I took refuge with the children in the classroom and then in a nearby house."" She believes the attack was an attempt by paramilitaries to frighten her into quitting her post. But like most crimes in the area, the child's killers were never brought to justice. CONSENSUS CANDIDATE The gutsy, pint-sized mayor was elected as the consensus candidate of political forces ranging from the traditional Liberal and Conservative Parties to the left-wing Patriotic Union, seen as the political wing of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's largest guerrilla army. She realised that in the short term it was impossible to take the guns out of local politics in this strategically located region where left and right have killed with impunity for more than a decade. But she has made repeated calls for townspeople to declare ""active neutrality"" and not take sides in the sectarian violence. ""You can't issue a decree about that because there's pain, suffering, refugees, resentment and people buried in shallow graves. But I do know the people of Apartado are tired of suffering,"" Cuartas said. Apartado, with a population of 80,000, is the regional centre of this banana-growing region, which spreads across the provinces of Antioquia, Choco and Cordoba. There were three massacres in and around the town last year, contributing to a death toll of more than 350 -- more than four times the national per capita average. Peasants are gunned down on a daily basis as they walk along dirt tracks that wind through lush banana plantations. And last month 11 civilians were killed and 60 others injured when FARC rebels detonated a massive car bomb in the town centre. LIBERATION THEOLOGY A HELP Cuartas, 36, a trained social worker, grew up near Medellin, Colombia's third largest city, and was educated by Carmelite nuns. ""I always read a lot about liberation theology -- that has been my guide. I was educated not just to talk of Jesus and justice but to construct it,"" Cuartas explained. Her work has received wide international recognition and last year she won the United Nations UNESCO Mayors for Peace award. But with less than a year before her mandate ends many at home are sceptical of her project for peace. ""Gloria Cuartas' neutrality is in question. She's more a friend of the guerrillas than of the other political actors,"" said Hernan Correa, one of the leaders of the banana workers' union Sintrainagro. Townspeople frequently complain about a lack of progress on public works projects and most adopt their own strategy of ""seeing but not looking and hearing but not listening"" to stay on the sidelines of the dirty war raging around them. Other critics believe Cuartas has gone too far for a supposedly neutral mayor in voicing claims of a secret pact between the army, the banana companies and right-wing death squads. The fact that those views feature on an Internet page (http://www.igc.apc.org/csn/gloria.html/) set up by the Colombia Support Network rights group based in Apartado's sister town of Madison, Wisconsin, has further raised hackles in the military. ""She uses the image of violence to sell her political ideas ... and gives a distorted view of what's going on and gets a page on the Internet. What does she want? She will be a tireless champion of the violations against the Patriotic Union,"" said Col. Mario Correa. But Cuartas, who shuns police protection and private bodyguards, continues to speak out regardless of the clamour of verbal attacks and a daily diet of death threats. ""I ask you who is killing the people. It's not peasant against peasant, are you blind? The whole world must speak out about this -- there's no room for another single body in this cemetery,"" she said. ","KarlPenhaul"
"A world chocolate industry group meeting Ivorian officals to discuss cocoa quality and supply will meet donors in Washington on Monday to discuss effects of market reforms on bean quality, a spokesman said Friday. ""We know that where there has been liberalisation in the past there has been a drop in quality,"" said a spokesman for the world industry forum OICCC (Office International du Cacao, du Chocolat et de la Confiserie). OICCC officials would meet World Bank officials in Washington on Monday, he said. ""You must protect quality and you must protect the forward market,"" OICCC spokesman Tom Harrison told Ivorian Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze at a meeting with journalists after separate talks with donors and ministers on Friday. The talks on Friday between OICCC representatives, Ivorian agriculture and commodities ministers and industry delegates, were held against a background of stricter food legislation worldwide and rising demand for quality chocolate in some countries. World supply has also fallen or stabilised in other producer countries, including Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia, leaving chocolate manufacturers more dependent on Ivorian production. ""Legislators and consumers are putting pressure on us,"" said one delegate. ""There are a lot of factories going up in Eastern Europe and Asia and we cannot afford hiccoughs."" Ivory Coast has closed upcountry cocoa checking stations and liberalised cocoa marketing since 1995 under the terms of a $150 million World Bank farm sector loan. Industry buyers say cocoa bean quality has dropped as a result. Donors reject the idea and say only a complete liberalisation of marketing prices will provide farmers with enough incentive to improve husbandry. Ivory Coast also put in place a cocoa export contract auction system but there have been concerns that rules encourage exporters to overbid to win contracts, creating a parallel price above terminal market levels. ""We have particular problems in blending good cocoa with poor cocoa... particularly since the Caisse (state marketing board) stopped upcountry quality checks,"" said Harrison. Exporters say poor and good quality beans are often mixed together to meet Ivory Coast's export grade standard of 105 beans per 100 grammes with under 10 percent humidity. Harrison also called for Ivory Coast to produce more of the high-quality beans that could be used to give chocolate its cocoa flavour. ""We do use some Ivorian beans in our flavour element (for chocolate) but we have to be highly selective,"" he said. ""To make high quality chocolate we need beans with no off-odours,"" said Harrison. ""Only one country produces the beans which give us the flavour element in our chocolate and that is Ghana,"" he added. The size of Ghana's crop is between a third and a quarter of Ivory Coast's annual crop, which in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) hit a record 1.2 million tonnes. It has kept upcountry checks in place and this week said it would not go ahead with donor-sponsored liberalisation of internal marketing. Ghanaian cocoa usually attracts a $30 dollars a tonne premium over other origins, including Ivory Coast. Ivory Coast and the World Bank held discussions in May on further cocoa sector liberalisation but disagreed on policies to increase competitiveness while maintaining quality. -- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"Labour unions at beleaguered French carmaker Renault SA called on Monday for a one-hour strike at all its factories in France, Belgium and Spain amid reports that the company will announce big job cuts. Renault said chairman Louis Schweitzer would this week meet representatives of a Belgian assembly plant, closure of which has already been announced, but declined comment on reports that 3,000 jobs will also go in France this year. The Belgian government and the northern Flanders region also said they would sue Renault over procedural issues after European Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the group had not followed European directive on consulting unions. Eight unions from Belgium, France and Spain called the one-hour strike and said they planned to take legal steps to thwart the decision to close the Belgain Vilvoorde plant. ""(We call) for a one-hour strike at all Renault sites in Belgium, Spain and France on March 7 during the day of action in the entire Belgian car industry against the Vilvoorde closure,"" the unions' statement said. A Renault spokeswoman said Schweitzer had agreed to meet staff this week at the Belgian plant, where 3,100 jobs will go, but the time and place had not been set. On Thursday he will attend a works council meeting in Paris to face angry French workers who fear job cuts in on top of the Belgian closure. The Renault spokeswoman had no comment on newspaper reports that it was preparing to announce a plan to cut about 3,000 jobs in France this year. But an industry source said somewhat fewer than 3,000 posts would go in 1997. Renault's troubles were highlighted by statistics showing new car sales in France slid 24.6 percent last month after tumbling 33.6 percent in January. The two-month drop reflected the market's weakness since a French state rebate programme, which had underpinned demand, ended in September. Faced with declining demand and gross overcapacity, Renault is being forced to cut production but must do so without French government support. With French unemployment at 12.7 percent and a general election due next year, the centre-right government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe has refused to back a plan to cut 40,000 jobs in the car industry over six years. French radio and newspapers gave blanket coverage to the labour dispute, with Le Figaro newspaper quoting the economy minister for Belgium's Flemish region as saying the closure was ""an act of economic terrorism"". Thousands of workers from Renault Belgium, supported by steelworkers, marched through Brussels to protest against the shutdown which is expected to save 825 million French francs ($144 million) a year. Belgian workers called for a Renault boycott. But on the French stock market, brokers said the company had to reduce output and restructure. Renault stock was down 4.02 percent at 141 francs at 1243 GMT, but that was due to profit-taking as the shares have risen 20 percent since last Wednesday. ""The big problem in the auto sector is overcapacity, a problem which no-one has dared to touch for 20 years for obvious labour reasons,"" said a broker. ""The fact that Renault is tackling it is a good sign."" Renault shed 1,641 jobs last year and 1,735 in 1995. Newspapers said charges for the job-cutting plans, on top of an operating loss at the group estimated at two billion francs or more, would result in a full year loss of more than five billion francs for the group in 1996. The car firm was privatised in stages in 1994 and 1996. Renault has four assembly plants in France, two in Spain, one in Portugal and one in Slovenia. ($ = 5.718 French Francs) ","PierreTran"
"Human rights and political liberty took centre stage in Hong Kong on Tuesday as human rights watchdogs said China was making it easier to crush dissent, boding ill for the territory after Beijing takes over. After 156 years under the British flag, Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 -- 63 days away -- and the pace of politics is quickening. The watchdog Human Rights Watch/Asia said changes to China's criminal code had made it easier for Beijing to stifle dissent, and Hong Kong people might even be put on trial in China. In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks on contentious issues but there was no shift in views on human rights or the future of Hong Kong, a Chinese spokesman said. A major ""public consultation"" on the future of political freedom in the colony ends on Wednesday, and the bustling capitalist outpost's 6.4 million people are sharply divided. The pulse-taking launched by future leader Tung Chee-hwa asks members of the public and organisations to submit views on his plan to ban foreign funding of political groups and curb the right to protest in the interests of ""national security"". Pro-democracy parties, the legal profession, human rights groups, Western-style trade unions and churches have all vigorously objected to the plan in written submissions, and there has been loud criticism from London and Washington. But organisations representing industry, commerce, pro-China political parties and pro-Beijing trade unions support Tung's plan, which was forced on him in March by a Chinese parliamentary resolution. In the latest twist, a powerful pro-Beijing labour group, the Federation of Trade Unions, urged a widening of definitions of political groups covered by the curbs. But in an unusual move, the federation also called for a ban on funding from China's ruling Communist Party to local political groups to be added to the restrictions. ""This will avoid disputes and criticisms. Hong Kong's political groups should stand on their own feet to fight for their beliefs,"" said the union's boss, Cheng Yiu-tong. Cheng's rival, pro-democracy trade union federation leader Lee Cheuk-yan, attacked Cheng's bid to widen the net. ""(It) is a step backward, because they want to have more organisations defined as political groups,"" Lee told Reuters. ""They want to pressure these organisations to depoliticise."" Tung's future Justice Secretary, Elsie Leung, said she was willing to consider calls for a ban on mainland funding. Such funding had not originally been mentioned because it was considered that the national security interests of Hong Kong and mainland organisations converged. ""But we will consider this proposal as so many people have raised it,"" she said at a function on Monday. Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a major report on Tuesday that China's striking of the term ""counterrevolution"", the communist code for subversion, from the law books in March did not mean easing political controls. Quite the opposite. ""China has merely replaced the term 'counterrevolution' with the equally elastic notion of 'endangering state security' and has, in the process, actually broadened the capacity of the state to suppress dissent,"" the report said. Hong Kong people, who China has vowed can keep their legal system and way of life for 50 years, could suffer, it said. ""The new security provisions will facilitate the labelling of all domestic critics as tools of 'hostile foreign forces',"" it said. ""Despite Hong Kong's separate legal system, Beijing may have the power to bring Hong Kong people to face trial in mainland courts."" ","PeterHumphrey"
"Czech politicians and pundits spent Monday panning the self-proclaimed ""King of Pop"" Michael Jackson for the first concert of his world tour on Saturday and his behavior in Prague in the week leading up. Columnists in almost every Czech daily blasted Jackson for his high-tech two-hour show, which some in the crowd of over 120,000 said was more video game than concert. ""The... spiceless performance with Jackson's appallingly bad vocals -- which were not even saved by his famous dance routines -- were complemented by an even worse sound system,"" said Stanislav Pechacek in the right-wing daily Denni Telegraf. Prague, known more as a former bastion for classical music than a pop mecca, has hosted a handful of huge festival-style concerts -- including two visits by the Rolling Stones -- since the revolution over Communism in 1989. But the city had never seen anything like the hype and hysteria surrounding Jackson's visit, which included erecting a giant statue of the star on the same rock pedastal where a monument to Soviet-leader Josef Stalin once stood. Jackson opened by exploding through the floor of a futuristic stage and emerged in gold-plated astronaut's armour. The next two-hours were choreographed with the aid of three huge ""Jumbotron"" screens flanking a stage blending a classical Greek temple with a space station. But columnists -- in a country embracing the kitschiest of American culture since the revolution -- took issue with Jackson's singing and the Cult of Personality around him, which clogged the streets in the city centre for five days. ""Jackson is the most bizarre product of American pop culture,"" Jan Lacina said in Lidove Noviny, describing the performance as surprisingly sober. ""A big nothing took place,"" said Vladimir Vlasak in the largest Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes, while complaining of Jackson's ""megalomania"". ""The music sounded as artificial as the singer himself,"" said Svobodne Slovo's Jaroslav Riedel. The three-month ""HIStory World Tour"" will take the multi-media spectacle to stops in Europe, Africa, Asia, but with no dates scheduled for the Americas. The harshest criticism -- in the minds of protocol-minded Czechs -- came from the Christian Democratic party, who peppered Jackson for not removing his trademark black fedora when meeting President Vaclav Havel at Prague Castle. The local agency CTK quoted Jan Kasal, who serves as deputy chairman of parliament for the centre right party, as saying Jackson had no manners and that he could not imagine any other visitors behaving in such a way. Jackson's next concert is scheduled for Tuesday night in Budapest. ","JohnMastrini"
"America Online Inc. stock tumbled Friday, a day after the online computer service reported a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss and after some analysts downgraded its stock. America Online stock dropped $2.25 to $35.875 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The world's biggest online service Thursday reported a second-quarter loss of $56 million before one-time charges, or 60 cents a share, for its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts on average had predicted a loss of 55 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst estimates. After the extraordinary items, which included a charge of $74.3 million related to a restructuring, America Online reported a loss of $154.8 million, or $1.64 a share. The company also took an unexpected $24 million charge in estimated refunds and credits for subscribers stemming from its recent network woes. The company's switch in December to flat-rate pricing caused an unexpected upsurge in the number of subscribers and the amount of time they spent online. That led to repeated busy signals for customers trying to log on from their personal computers, angering them and drawing attention from state attorneys general in 37 states. Under pressure from the attorneys general, the Dulles, Va.-based company agreed last month to provide refunds and usage credits. America Online has nearly 8 million subscribers. Smith Barney analyst Jonathan Cohen on Friday lowered his rating on America Online stock to underperform from neutral, saying that, excluding the charges, operating results fell below his expectations. ""In our view, many of America Online's extraordinary charges during the quarter were somewhat less than extraordinary and would have been more appropriately recognised as regular operating results,"" Cohen said. He pointed out that America Online chose to recognise as revenues subscriber payments while at the same time treating the refund of those same payments as a non-recurring charge. Morgan Stanley analyst Mary Meeker also downgraded America Online, to outperform from buy but details of her comments were not available. Other analysts said the quarter was not a disappointment, but that they believed the stock fell because it became clear America Online will not break even until the quarter ended in June, as opposed to the third quarter ending in March, as previously hoped. ""They aren't going to do it because of the modems, said Nesbitt Burns analyst Abhishek Gami, who reiterated a strong buy rating. ""But by doing what they are doing with the modems, they are accelerating the healing process."" America Online said Thursday it will spend $10 million to $15 million to lease 50,000 modems from a computer network provider that it declined to name. It said the move will enable it to expand its network to meet subscriber demand by April, two months ahead of schedule. ","TheresePoletti"
"U.S. utility group CE Electric upped the stakes in its hostile bid for British power company Northern Electric on Friday, raising its offer to a final 650 pence a share and setting a December 20 deadline. But CE's hopes that Northern would recommend the raised 782 million pound ($1.29 billion) bid were dashed as Northern rejected the offer after carefull consideration. CE Electric chairman David Sokol's said earlier he hoped Northern would recommend the bid after it was raised from 759 million pounds. CE Electric, the bid vehicle for CalEnergy of the United States, said the new offer represented ""compelling value."" ""This is an overwhelmingly strong offer,"" Sokol said in an interview. But Northern Electric chairman David Morris responded with a statement saying: ""CE Electric has failed to recognise Northern Electric's true value in its revised offer."" ""It (CE) has ignored the new information provided and it is still looking to buy Northern Electric too cheaply. Shareholders should reject this revised offer."" CE Electric has already snapped up nearly 30 percent of its target as Northern's share price has languished under concerns that the British government would block the bid. Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang is expected to decide by December 16 whether or not to refer the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) for review. Northern's shares lost 1p to 600 pence by the close as the overall market slid by more than two percent. ""The latest offer probably still undervalues Northern but I think it will succeed...I think shareholders will (accept),"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. Northern rushed out half year results last week as part of its efforts to push up CE Electric's offer and said gearing should have fallen to 95 percent by March 1997 against earlier forecasts of 175 percent. Northern has claimed that talks between the two companies before CE Electric launched its bid indicated a price of 700 pence per share but the Americans have consistently denied this. Sokol said Northern had not produced any new information in its defence documents but added CE Electric had been holding back ""a certain amount of dollars"" in hopes of a recommendation. ""But given that Northern's board has not wanted to talk, we felt it was not fair to withhold the cash from shareholders,"" Sokol said. He said the final deadline had been brought forward to December 20 from early January because it would give certainty to employees and shareholders ahead of the holiday season. Northern, one of only a handful of independent power companies remaining, has called on the government to let the bid go ahead and made clear its only dispute with CE Electric is on price.

"The Sydney 2000 Olympics does not appear to be generating the economic bonanza many had hoped for and will not boost Sydney house prices, two construction and real estate forecasters said on Tuesday. ""The impact of the Olympics hasn't been as great as we'd been led to believe,"" Knight Frank Independent director Philip Ragan told a Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) seminar. Construction of the games facilities and preparations for the games were in full swing, but were not yet adding significantly to the economy, Ragan said. In 1993, when the Sydney was awarded the games, analysts forecast that the extra construction, tourism and jobs generated by the games would cumulatively add A$7 billion (US$5.3 billion) to A$8 billion to gross domestic product by 2001. Ragan said the cumulative economic effect was likely to be closer to A$3 billion because of cost over-runs, lower revenue projections and the leakage of sponsorship revenues offshore. ""The outcome is coming in at the low end of expectations, in fact, significantly lower,"" Ragan said. Olympics-related job creation had originally been estimated at about 150,000, but only 800 specific jobs had been created so far and only about 2,800 temporary jobs were seen in 2000, he said. The state government and various private consortia are expected to spend about A$3.2 billion building new facilities. But Ragan said this amount spent over four years was not a major increase on the A$10 billion spent each year on such construction in Sydney. An expected nine percent rise in state government revenues and a trend towards higher savings would also swamp the Olympic-led boost to the local economy, he said. ""The effect of the Olympics is being more than overshadowed by other changes happening in the economy,"" he said. BIS Schrapnel building and construction director Robert Mellor said he expected Sydney property prices to rise almost 40 percent in the lead up to the year 2000 and then slide in the years immediately after the Olympics. But Mellor said this would have happened regardless of Sydney having the Olympics. ""It's got nothing to do with the Olympics. I don't see it having any effect,"" Mellor told the CEDA seminar. ""The positives may not be as great as the econometric models may indicate,"" he said. The Atlanta Olympics had shown retailers and street traders had not done nearly as well as expected, Mellor said. He pointed to the recent rash of legal actions by Atlanta's Olympic vendors against organisers for promising unrealistic likely incomes. Those residential areas very close to the games site at Homebush Bay in Sydney's Western Suburbs may benefit from the new recreational facilities built there, but the bulk of Sydney's housing market would not notice. He said the prospect of some home owners being able to rent out their homes for A$1,000 or A$2,000 for two weeks was unlikely to provide a general boost to the market. ""It just doesn't change the fundamental reason for buying a house in Sydney,"" he said. (A$=US$0.7590) ","BernardHickey"
"For many in China, a fabled El Dorado lies at the southern tip of their vast country -- Hong Kong, rich and elusive. The dream is likely to stay that way after the British-ruled territory reverts to Chinese rule on June 30. Yang He, a Hong Kong resident for the past 40 years, has waited more than 11 years for his son to get a permit to come from China to join him, his wife and two daughters. ""We applied in 1986 for my son to come to Hong Kong. He has been cared for by his grandparents since he was a baby. ""We had to leave him when he was only 25 days old because he had no permit,"" Yang, 56, told Reuters in a recent interview. ""Most nights I cannot sleep for just thinking of him."" Yang is not alone in his suffering. Hong Kong authorities say there are 34,000 children in China waiting to join either one or both parents in Hong Kong, but Chinese authorities say the figure could be higher than 100,000. CHINESE HEAR OF CITY STREETS PAVED WITH GOLD In China, rock stars sing patriotic songs welcoming the return of Hong Kong, and television stations beam into Chinese homes documentaries describing the wealthy metropolis, giving an impression of streets lined with opportunities -- and gold. But most of China's 1.2 billion people will probably never set foot on Hong Kong soil. Although the British will leave and the Chinese red flag will flutter over the territory, Hong Kong will be separately run under a ""one country, two systems"" formula espoused by China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. To stop a flood of mainlanders into the tiny but crowded territory of 6.4 million people, border security is tight -- on both sides of the line. Hong Kong operates a quota system permitting 150 mainlanders to migrate to Hong Kong each day, 66 of them children. But it can take years to obtain the precious ""one-way permit"" -- and many resort to backdoor methods in dispair. QUOTAS OPEN TO CORRUPTION China-born Yang said he has totally lost faith in China's bureaucracy and communist system, which he said was so riddled with corruption that only the rich can buy their way out. ""In 1995, when I asked again about the status of my son's application, they (government officials) asked for money. They said they wanted at least HK$130,000 (US$16,800),"" Yang said. ""They told me it wasn't them who would take all the money, they have to ask favours from other people, buy cigarettes, drinks, fruit, and there wasn't such a thing as digging from their own pockets to pay my son's passage to Hong Kong."" Yang paid HK$40,000 (US$5,175) and a few gold rings when he applied in 1985 to get his wife and eldest daughter to join him. They arrived in 1986. But there was no permit for his baby. ""If you have money, you can come, proudly by train, if not, you can't come. If you haven't enough, you come illegally, dangerously by speedboat in the night,"" he said. ""You don't know the Chinese system, it is so corrupt, it would be best if after the handover, the Hong Kong government takes over the responsibility of approving the applications,"" said So Ying, a mother who has waited five years for her son and daughter to join her and her husband in Hong Kong. Some get so frustrated by the wait that they have taken the matter into their own hands, paying between HK$2,000 to HK$4,000 to smugglers -- or ""snakeheads"" as they are known locally -- to spirit their spouses and children into Hong Kong. Between January and April 1997, 1,449 young illegal migrants surrendered to authorities against 540 for the whole of 1996. In the first four months of 1997, 7,406 illegal migrants, including adults, were arrested around border areas, against 23,180 for the whole of 1996. HONG KONG AUTHORITIES GET TOUGH In an unusual show of force, Hong Kong immigration officials last month seized eight-year-old Chung Yeuk-lam and her mother from their flat and sent them back to China. The girl had been carried illegally into Hong Kong by her mother when she was just three months old. Colonial Governor Chris Patten said it was important not to make exceptions in order to quash rumours spread by snakeheads that there will be an amnesty for illegals after the handover, which the Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied. Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have joined forces to block the tide of mainland Chinese illegal immigrants. The South China Morning Post has said one way to help solve the problem would be to quash the El Dorado myth in China. ""The simplest way to shrink their numbers would be if China dispelled the idea that Hong Kong's streets are paved with gold,"" the newspaper said. ","TanEeLyn"
"A threatened overhaul of Britain's Securities and Investments Board (SIB) by a future Labour government and news it must find a new chairman will make the next few months uncertain for the top financial watchdog. The opposition Labour Party has said that if it wins power in elections this year it would streamline London's regulatory bodies, giving the SIB greater responsibility. But insiders at the SIB, which was set up in 1985 and is charged with ensuring regulatory system works efficiently, said on Friday it was business as usual at the watchdog. While surprised by chairman Sir Andrew Large's decision on Thursday to give up his post at the end of May, industry sources said they believed his successor would not necessarily be plucked from the ranks of Britain's frontline regulators. ""They will not only have to have the intellect and leadership qualities, but also the gravitas and authority that must accompany the role,"" one told Reuters. The SIB supervises the so-called ""frontline"" regulators which independently authorise firms to conduct investment business in Britain. These self-regulating organisations also monitor firms, handle complaints and punish rule-breakers. Large said the bulk of the changes he had been charged with overseeing had been completed but pointed out that the main unfinished business was the unsatisfactory rate of progress on a a long-running review of pensions mis-selling. This saga is likely to bedevil whoever takes over from Large as insurance companies seek to resolve outstanding pensions cases. Newspapers said the job might go to Phillip Thorpe at the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO), Colette Bowe of the Personal Investment Authority (PIA) or former Securities and Futures Authority head Christopher Sharples. ""It (the job) has not gone to professional regulators before,"" the first source said. Given the prospect of a new government, and possibly a new ruling political party, regulatory sources agree the appointment of 54-year-old Large's successor will be particularly significant. The ruling Conservative Party must call an election by May 22 and opinion polls suggest a Labour victory may be the likely outcome. A new SIB chairman may be named before the election but he or she will take over the reins in early June. The choice of a new chairman is made jointly by the Treasury and the head of the Bank of England, but because of the timing of the appointment, the Labour party is also expected to be canvassed for its views on the individuals to be short-listed. But the Treasury declined to comment on any of the names mentioned or how exactly the vacancy would be filled. ""We are not detailing the procedure but at this stage no one is ruled in and no one is ruled out,"" a Treasury spokesman said. A factor which could limit those wanting to be considered for the role is money, especially when compared with the sort of salaries paid in the private sector. While top-quality bankers or financiers can expect large pay packets, the money on offer for the SIB job is expected to be relatively little by comparison. During the year 1995-96, Large was paid just over 175,000 pounds. ""The money could turn out to be the sticking point,"" one regulatory source said, adding that the selectors would not rush to find a replacement for Large. ""Its a big job and its important to get the right person,"" he said. ","AlexanderSmith"
"China and the United States reached agreement on Sunday to extend a deal on textiles, averting a multi-billion dollar trade war, an official with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said. ""The two sides will be signing the agreement in a ceremony shortly,"" the official said by telephone. The eleventh-hour agreement followed marathon all-night talks between U.S. chief textile negotiator Rita Hayes and a team of Chinese officials on renewal of a 1994 textile accord and resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese textile exports. Hayes had said on Saturday she was confident of accord in last-ditch talks after extending by a day a January 31 deadline for multi-million dollar penalties on China's exports. The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise. Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions. China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks. Hayes said earlier issues at the forefront in the final rounds of talks were two major demands -- the U.S. market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry. Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier. Washington could have made significant cuts to China's textile quotas if an agreement had not been reached before the deadline. Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in the dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries. ","MureDickie"
"Pop star Michael Jackson launched his first concert tour in three years on Saturday with a high-tech spectacle in Prague aimed at restoring a career tarnished by allegations of child molestation. Jackson exploded through the floor of his futuristic stage and emerged in gold-plated astronaut's armour to open the concert with one of his latest hits, ""Scream"". On a stage blending a classical Greek temple with a space station, Jackson matched the high tech wizardry with his formidable dancing skills, singing many of the hits of his 20-year career. The three-month ""HIStory World Tour"" will take hundreds of tonnes of equipment to stops in Europe, Africa, Asia, but with no dates scheduled for the Americas. Many of the estimated 120,000 spectators on Prague's sprawling Letna Plain -- where Communist leaders once reviewed military parades -- stood awestruck as massive ""Jumbotron"" video screens dominated Jackson's virtual-reality show. ""It's more of a video game than a concert,"" said one Prague student as she stood in the crowd mid-way from where the real Jackson looked like a blip on a radar screen. Fans from Malta to Moscow made the trip to Prague, but the biggest of the 40,000-strong foreign contingent came from neighbouring Germany where Jackson had cancelled planned stops because of high taxes charged to visiting entertainers. Some 130,000 people were expected for the two-hour concert in Prague, but ticket touts outside the gates were offering $30 tickets for less than $10. Czech President Vaclav Havel -- dubbed ""Rock'n Roll President"" as a fan of the Rolling Stones, Velvet Undergound and Frank Zappa, who have all played in Prague -- showed up although he said Jackson's music ""isn't close"" to him. The first part of the tour has a heavy Eastern European flavour with stops planned for Hungary, Romania, Poland, and Russia, matching a theme running through the ""HIStory"" album which includes the song ""Stranger in Moscow"". The first tour of the self-proclaimed ""King of Pop"" since 1993's ""Dangerous"" tour is to back ""HIStory,"" which has lagged well behind his 1982 album ""Thriller"", the all-time top seller with 44 million copies sold worldwide. But the tour marks the biggest effort yet to get Jackson's career back on track after a long-running scandal over child-sex abuse allegations. The charges first came to light in August 1993, when a 13-year-old boy accused Jackson of molesting him. Jackson denied wrongdoing but reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the boy, and prosecutors dropped their investigation in 1994 after the child refused to testify. The concert marks the climax of five of the most bizarre days in the history of the ancient Czech capital, as the star's game of hide-and-seek kept a horde of fans and media guessing outside his hotel, and clogged streets in the city's centre. Reports that Jackson was furious with a local tabloid's rehash of the child molestation story led local media to speculate that he might cancel Saturday's concert as he remained holed-up in his hotel suite for much of the week. On Friday, Jackson sparked a near-riot when he ventured out to visit St Vitus Cathedral in Prague Castle, and fans climbed over pews in the holy Bohemian shrine to get close. Meanwhile, concert organisers erected a giant water-filled statue of Jackson on the same hill over Prague where a massive monument to Soviet-leader Josef Stalin once stood.  REUTER ","JohnMastrini"
"The head of General Motors Corp.'s  Chevrolet Division said Monday he wants customers to be able to buy a new car or truck in 90 minutes -- down from the six to eight hours it often takes today. Chevrolet also plans to expand a pilot program called Custom XPress Delivery, whereby buyers of popularly configured Blazers can receive the sport/utility vehicle one day after they sign the papers. ""Customers shouldn't have to wait six to eight weeks to take delivery on a new vehicle with the color and options they want,"" said John Middlebrook, general manager of Chevrolet, GM's largest single division. The changes are part of a series of what Chevrolet calls ""Brand Critical Standards"" the division plans to roll out on a national level this year. ""Today, building a quality product is just the price of entry,"" Middlebrook said in a speech at the Automotive News World Congress here. ""Dealership experiences set us apart and help make the difference between winning and losing a loyal customer."" Middlebrook predicted that changes to the distribution system, dealership culture and retail process will be the industry's dominant focus into the 21st century. Driving the changes are customer demands for better service and better treatment from the existing new car sales process, one he said has not changed in more than 80 years. He cited the rapid rise of new companies such as Car Max and AutoNation. Often called ""Big Box"" retailers, the new stores offer a wide selection of certified used cars, as well as new cars, at no-haggle prices. ""The bottom line is that customers' expectations are changing and will continue to drive change into the retail sales process for automobiles,"" he said. Another area Chevrolet wants dealers to change is the selling process itself. Many sales representatives now spend 20 percent of their time helping a customer settle on a new vehicle, and 80 percent negotiating over the price. Chevrolet wants those numbers reversed. ""Our stores have to convey an image that is consistent with the Chevrolet brand. Customers should feel genuine trust when they walk into a Chevrolet dealership,"" he said. Chevrolet is continuing its plan to reduce the number of dealerships. Eventually, the division wants 4,000 in the United States instead of the current 4,400, said Middlebrook. Talking to reporters later, Middlebrook said dealers should have ""good availabitity"" of Chevrolet's new Venture minivan when advertising begins in February or March. However, he warned that overall inventories will be tight. ""We're going to be short because I think demand will exceed supply,"" he said, adding that Chevrolet plans to make and sell 70,000 to 75,000 of the new minivans in 1997. Despite flat total U.S. minivan sales during the last several months, Middlebrook predicted the segment will grow 25 percent over the next five years as buyers from more demographic groups need the practicality they offer. ""As you look at the minivans and their acceptibility, it's across the total age spectrum. We're seeing more and more retirees in a minivan when they retire,"" he said. ""Minivans are going across the entire market spectrum -- much like station wagons used to."" Middlebrook said segment leader Chrysler Corp. remains the GM's top competitor in the minivan market. In addition to GM, Toyota Motor Corp. will enter the market with a new front-wheel drive product called the Sienna in the fall. Last week, Toyota executives said they expect to sell all of the 50,000 to 60,000 Sienna's they can produce in the first model year it is on the market. ","ToddNissen"
"Two members of Congress criticised the Federal Reserve Thursday for what they called its ""woefully inadequate"" record of hiring and promoting women and minorities. Representative Henry Gonzalez and Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., in a letter to Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, said several discrimination lawsuits against the bank ""show a clear need for reform."" The letter paired persistent Fed critic Gonzalez, a Democrat from Texas serving his 19th term in Congress, with second-term Illinois Democrat Jackson, son of the well-known civil rights leader. A Fed spokesman declined comment. One of the lawsuits, filed against the central bank in January by four black secretaries, may be expanded as 15 other current and former employees have asked to join the litigation, the two Democratic lawmakers said. ""As one of the nation's primary banking regulators, the Federal Reserve should serve as a model for the banking system it regulates,"" the two wrote to Greenspan. ""Despite being at the forefront in carrying out the nation's laws, we are concerned that the Federal Reserve's record of diversity in hiring and promotion is woefully inadequate."" The four black secretaries filed suit Jan. 21 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of themselves and ""all others similarly situated."" A black Fed researcher won a similiar suit against the bank in 1994, the Congressmen noted. Gonzalez and Jackson asked Greenspan to assess the validity of the complaints and report if any action has been taken to address the alleged problems. They did commend the central bank for increasing the number of women and minorities among the most highly paid Fed employees over the past three years. In 1993, only one woman and one non-white were among the 35 top paid staff earning more than $125,000. Now, with 72 people making that much, 11 are women and five are minorities. The hiring of additional women ""is an important step in ending what appeared to be gender bias in the selection of top staff, but it is still below comparable government standards which are also too low,"" Gonzalez and Jackson said. Minority representation ""remains poor."" ","AaronPressman"
"The prospect of a shake-up at Sedgwick Group looked possible on Wednesday after news that a U.S. fund manager known for his aggressive attitude to underperforming companies had taken a sizeable stake in the insurance broker. Chicago-based David Herro, instrumental two years ago in ousting Maurice Saatchi as chairman of the advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, since renamed Cordiant, now owns over three percent of Sedgwick through his mutual fund, Oakmark International. A spokeswoman for Sedgwick said it had held several meetings with Herro as part of its normal programme of contacts with institutional investors, but declined further comment. Herro led a shareholders revolt against Saatchi in a battle over boardroom pay in 1994. Saatchi left the firm he founded with his brother, but took some of the group's leading clients with him. Shares in Sedgwick, which has made no secret of its  desire to take part in the quickening consolidation in the insurance broking sector, rose three pence to 127.5 pence. The shares have rebounded from a year's low of 113 pence only last week, a gain of nearly 13 percent. Herro's shareholding may signal renewed pressure on the company to do something following the poor performance of the shares in recent years. They have fallen nearly 40 percent since the beginning of 1992, compared with a 71 percent advance in Britain's leading shares over the same period. A demand for action could come in three weeks time at the group's annual meeting on April 24. There are fears that Sedgwick may have missed the boat after a stream of mergers and takeovers among rival firms. Just last month Marsh &amp; Mclennan announced a $1.8 billion merger with Johnson &amp; Higgins to form the world's largest broker. The $1.2 billion merger of Aon and Alexander &amp; Alexander in the U.S. last December, followed swiftly on the heels of Aon's purchase of Bain Hogg from Inchcape. JIB Group and Lloyd Thompson merged at the end of last year to form Jardine Lloyd Thompson. This has left Britains's two largest brokers, Sedgwick and Willis Corroon somewhat stranded and has raised the prospect of the two being pushed into each others arms as the only solution to their current difficulties. Willis has always brushed off suggestions it may be interested in teaming up with its British rival. But Sedgwick chairman Sax Riley, until recently group chief executive, has repeatedly refused to rule out a merger. After the results in February which saw a five percent rise in pre-tax profits to 95.5 million pounds ($155.2 million) Riley said the group continued to look at opportunities in the sector and predicted a second round of consolidation was about to begin in the industry. The attraction of mergers are the huge cost savings firms can strip out. Marsh &amp; Mclennan predicted annual cost savings of at least $150 million following its March deal. However, mergers also raise potentially big  difficulties in marrying often very different corporate cultures and the risks of damage to staff morale or loss of key personnel have to be weighed carefully. But insurance broking is suffering from overcapacity and stagnant or declining commissions. Insurance premiums, the basis for commissions, have slumped in the past decade. There has also been a trend of companies taking on more risk themselves and paying fees for risk management advice rather than commission for broking. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds) ","SimonCowell"
"UK defence to industrial giant GEC Plc said on Friday that it could impose up to 1,000 job cuts at its two newly-acquired businesses as part of the restructuring process announced in its results statement earlier. Finance director David Newlands told Reuters that the job losses would hit in AG Power Transmission and Distribution and the Hazeltine Corp of the U.S., particularly the former. The cost is expected to be 45 million stg of the total 160 million charge revealed earlier. Another 50 million of that total relates to asset write-downs at two other units.   Newlands refused to name which two companies had seen reduced asset values, but he said that the move was necessary in order to dispose of them. ""We've had many offers for companies in the industrial group over the years - all have been well above the book value, except for these two."" He said he expected the first sale of those companies marked for disposal to take place before Christmas. ""We are trying to accelerate the disposal programme. But is takes two to tango,"" said Newlands, who refused to name the firms. The rest of the 160 million charge announced in Friday's results relates to restructuring within remaining firms.   On the continuing strategic review, Newlands said ""George Simpson (the successor to former managing director Lord Weinstock) arrived in September and has been meeting with managers and getitng on with the task. We expect some announcement before we next speak to analysts in June/July."" He said the group would divest ""Where a business is not making satisfactory returns on capital or has satisfactory growth prospects."" Commenting on the sluggish state of the semi-conductor market, which saw lower profits in the first half, Newlands said he did not see a recovery until ""spring or summer of next year."" GEC reported a sharp fallback in half year profits on Friday to 261 million stg from 402 million after taking the 160 million charge. Underlying profits rose just 4.7 percent to 421 million. The interim payout was 3.26 pence versus 3.10 pence. --London newsroom +44 171 5427717 ","EdnaFernandes"
"America Online Inc., besieged by complaints by frustrated customers unable to log on and facing the threat of a lawsuit by at least one state, agreed Wednesday to give some members refunds or credit. The world's largest online service, with 8 million subscribers, agreed in principle to give customers their choice of a free month online or up to $39.90 -- the cost of two months of its unlimited service -- as a result of its recent negotiations with dozens of state attorneys general. AOL also said it planned to hold its membership at 8 million members for the short term, until it was confident it could meet the needs of its current members. America Online Chairman Steve Case said the company had been working out a refund offer to its members and that the attorneys general in several states agreed Wednesday afternoon to support its proposed plan to members. ""We felt like today we had to move forward with our programme, with or without an agreement,"" Case said in an interview. ""We were pleased at the final hour that the attorneys general are supporting it... It was a concern that our members were waiting for us to respond. If there hadn't been so many states involved, we could have responded a few days ago."" Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan held a news conference in Chicago, to announce the preliminary deal with the company and 36 states including Illinois, before AOL's announcement. Ryan said he expected the Dulles, Va.-based company would formally sign the agreement by Thursday. ""We're comfortable with it. We think it's a good deal for consumers,"" he said. America Online, which since Dec. 1 has been struggling to deal with an unexpectedly big surge in subscribers, also agreed to halt for a month advertising aimed at attracting new customers. The proposed settlement headed off, for now, consumer fraud lawsuits threatened by at least one state, New York and under consideration by several other states. Several class action lawsuits have been filed against AOL, and AOL said this agreement has nothing to do with the class action lawsuits. The agreement calls for customers to receive graduated refunds of up to $39.90 based on how much time they spent over the past two months logged onto AOL, Ryan said. Any customer can demand a free month's service, no questions asked, but the consumer must request the credit. ""It's a way of saying thank you to our members for their support,"" said an AOL spokeswoman. Case declined to estimate the cost of the refunds, but New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco told a Manhattan news conference he expected the refunds will cost the company several million dollars in his state alone. There are 600,000 AOL members in New York state. Wall Street analysts said they did not expect the refunds to have much of a financial impact on AOL, because it will be cutting way back on its quarterly marketing expenses, which average about $120 million to $130 million a quarter. ""Even if you make some pretty aggressive assumptions about how many people will call for refunds, then you have the number who will qualify,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst. ""I come up with $10 to $15 million in terms of cash cost, which will be offset by reduced marketing expenses."" AOL moved to placate angry customers on Jan. 16, telling them it would spend $350 million to upgrade its network, $100 million more than it had announced in December. Ryan said the pact originally covered 37 states, but said Missouri's attorney general backed out at the last minute to take a closer look at the proposed refunds. AOL ran into capacity troubles after it switched its customers from a subscription plan based on the number of hours online to a flat $19.95 monthly rate for unlimited use. Under the agreement announced Wednesday, AOL agreed to cease all new advertising for the month of February unless already contracted for. Vacco said any ads must include a disclaimer that congestion may prevent customers from getting online. The prosecutors had complained America Online was continuing to advertise and sign up new customers even as it could not deliver the service to existing users. AOL also agreed to hire additional operators to field calls from customers seeking to cancel the service, and will set up facilities to accept cancellations via mail or fax, in addition to telephone requests. Members had complained they could not cancel the service. Customers in the 36 states also could contact the attorney general's office in that state to file a refund request. Attorneys general or their aides from 20 states met last week in Chicago with the company. ""If there are fresh complaints, we can still file a lawsuit under the consumer fraud laws,"" Ryan said. ""This does not preclude us from acting on behalf of consumers."" ","TheresePoletti"
"British airports operator BAA Plc is expected to show taxable profits continuing to climb when it reports third quarter and nine-month results on Monday as the number of people travelling by air travel continues to rise. Analysts predict that pretax profits for the nine months to December 31 will come in at between 392 million stg and 400 from 374 million pounds last time.   Passenger traffic at its airports, which include the country's two biggest hubs of London Heathrow and Gatwick, rose 4.4 percent in the nine months to 76.62 million passengers. But the company's prospects have been overshadowed by fears that Britain's opposition Labour Party could include BAA in its hit list for the windfall tax, which it has vowed to impose on former state-owned utilities should it win the election. Labour says a certain number of utilities such as the water and power companies were sold off too cheaply by the Conservative government and led to ""fat cat"" executives overpaying themselves and their shareholders with the proceeds.   BAA refuses to countenance the prospect, saying it has done everything the utilities should have done since it was privatised in 1987, investing in the business including plans to build a giant fifth passenger terminal at London Heathrow. ""We are not a utility, we are not a fat cat, we have not paid either special dividends or returned money to shareholders or made any mega acquisitions to get rid of our money,"" BAA's finance director Russell Walls said last November. BAA reported pre-tax profits rose only 3.4 percent to 304 million stg in the six months to September 30 and earnings were up just 3.3 percent to 22.2 pence a share.   But it said underlying pretax profits were up 10.5 percent and earnings up by 11.1 percent because it made a nine million stg exceptional gain in the comparable period a year ago. It was also phasing out seasonal fluctuations in airport user charges, which had reduced income by 11 million stg in the first half but would be recovered in the second half. With airport landing and passenger handling charges regulated under a five-year pricing formula, BAA is concentrating on trying to boost retail revenues from the shopping arcades it has built at most of its terminals.   First half net retail income rose 10.7 percent to 224.5 million stg, with passengers spending an average of 4.20 stg each, 7.2 percent more than a year ago. Total group revenue including retail was up 6.3 percent at 742 million stg. Income from airport user charges increased by 1.8 percent to 283 million stg. Revenue from property rose 7.7 percent to 112 million stg. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","EdnaFernandes"
"Union leaders restarted talks with government ministers on Thursday morning in a bid to end a strike by public sector workers, now in its third day. Interior Minister Horacio Serpa said he hoped for ""serene and sincere"" negotiations but admitted the government, battling to rein in a burgeoning fiscal deficit, did not have much room for manoeuvre. Union representatives expressed mild optimism but insisted the strike by an estimated 800,000 state workers would not be lifted until there was firm agreement on demands, including a 21.5 percent pay hike and an end to the planned privatisation of regional and national industries. ""We hope these talks will be serene and sincere. We will look into workers' demands in the broadest and most generous form but they must understand we have problems,"" Serpa tolds reporters. The last round of negotiations broke up without agreement last Sunday when the government stuck to its original weighted 13.5 percent pay offer and refused to budge on privatisation plans. Hernando Hernandez, leader of the main oil workers' union known for its combative and fiercely nationalistic stance, feared there was little chance of a rapid breakthrough. Unitary Workers' Confederation leader, Luis Eduardo Garzon, meanwhiile, said state workers may bend on some of their demands if the government was prepared to compromise. ""I think there's a positive atmosphere. We're ready to look for alternatives if the government is prepared to do the same,"" he said. There have been conflicting reports on the impact of the industrial action. President Ernesto Samper said just 10 percent of state workers had heeded the strike call while unions said they had severely disrupted key economic and social sectors, including oil, telecommunications, education and all but emergency health care and long-distance road freight. In parallel with talks, unions are scheduled to stage the biggest protest marches of the strike so far in Colombia's five largest cities. A demonstration on Tuesday ended in running battles between riot police and a 200-strong group of protesters hurling bricks and bottles. About 40 buses bringing demonstrators from Colombia's eastern plains region to the capital were detained early on Tuesday morning at a military roadblock near Villavicencio, about 60 miles (100 km) east of Bogota. An army spokesman said the convoy was later allowed to continue. The spokesman said a strong security presence would be maintained throughout the country as long as the labour action lasted. Despite threats from National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels and government warnings that leftist guerrillas were trying to infiltrate the strike movement, no serious violence has been reported since the start of the work stoppage at midnight on Monday.

"A Chinese ideologue known for his strictly orthodox Marxist views denied on Tuesday that he was the author of two essays critical of China's reforms. Deng Liqun, 81, a former Communist Party propaganda chief and secretary to Chairman Mao Zedong, said the author of two articles that have become known as ""The 10,000 Word Essay"" was Li Yanming. ""I didn't write the essay, it was Li Yanming,"" Deng told reporters. He did not further identify Li Yanming and gave no Asked whether he supported Li's views in ""The 10,000 Word Essay"" that has sparked widespread behind-the-scenes debate, he smiled and shrugged and said: ""He wrote what was on his mind."" Deng was attending an economic summit in Beijing that was assessing the business climate in China, with a heavy emphasis on the successes of the reform programme launched in 1979 by Deng Xiaoping to eliminate stultifying Stalinist-style planning in favour of market forces. Asked if he agreed with issues under debate at the conference, Deng adopted the officially-sanctioned public party line: ""Of course. China is a very big country, it has a lot of potential but it also has a lot of problems to be solved."" Several of the speakers at the conference called for tougher efforts to reform China's ailing state-owned enterprises, which ""The 10,000 Word Essay"" warns are suffering at the expense of private enterprise. China's propaganda tsars recently suspended a magazine and banned articles by a leading bankruptcy expert after a lengthy behind-doors debate on the essay erupted into the public eye. The ban prompted an open letter by a writer in Beijing questioning whether China's propaganda officials were opposed to economic reform and whether they backed the leadership of state president and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin. The Press and Publications Administration, under the party's powerful Propaganda Department, suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly, based in southwestern Guizhou province, in August, said sources familiar with the magazine. The suspension followed the magazine's publication of an article critical of the privately circulated 10,000-word essay, which also urges a return to the class struggle espoused by Mao. Western diplomats and Chinese analysts have described a literary and cultural freeze in recent months amid a crackdown by propaganda tsars on publications and authors that dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare. The president of the outspoken Beijing Youth Daily is to be replaced soon by a more conservative editor. The clampdown has been fuelled by a call for ""spiritual civilisation"" -- a communist watchword for orthodox Marxist values -- as the theme for a party plenum scheduled for later this month, the analysts said. Party chief Jiang is said to have distanced himself from the essay at the annual session of the National People's Congress, or parliament, last March, when he reportedly said: ""Some people say I support the 10,000-word essay, isn't that underestimating me too much?""

"The deteriorating health of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping has forced Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and other leaders to cut short out-of-town trips to return to Beijing, sources said on Monday. Jiang, who is also state president and head of the army, returned at the weekend, cutting short an unpublicised visit to the communist revolutionary base of Ganzhou in central Jiangxi province, said one Chinese source close to the party. Premier Li Peng also flew back to Beijing at the weekend, abruptly curtailing a tour of the booming, southern province of Guangdong, said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""Jiang Zemin and Li Peng cut short their trips and rushed back to Beijing because Deng Xiaopings health was deteriorating,"" the source said. ""They went to see Deng...over the weekend,"" the source said. ""His health is not looking good."" The 92-year-old Deng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded compound behind the Forbidden City of Chinas emperors in central Beijing. Diplomats have said one barometer of Dengs health in Chinas highly-secretive system is the travel of top leaders and close family members, with few willing to be out of town or abroad if Deng were close to death. Vice-Premier Li Lanqing was on a visit to Israel and Iran and Defence Minister Chi Haotian is in the Philippines. Chinese sources have reported increasing rumours in Beijing in the past few days that Dengs health may be failing. The State Council, or cabinet, declined on Monday to comment on the rumours. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week Deng was all right for a man of his age. Hong Kongs Apple Daily newspaper reported at the weekend that the architect of Chinas sweeping economic reforms had been rushed to hospital on Thursday after a massive stroke that followed an earlier, mild stroke. Rumours about Dengs health surface periodically and Hong Kong stocks tumbled last Friday on one rumour. Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival when he visited Shanghai and appeared frail and faltering. He is now believed to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity. Chinas elderly leaders exert great influence after their retirement in a society where age is revered and in a communist system in which officials spend years building up a power base. State-run Chinese media have rarely carried reports on Deng since he vanished from public view, partly because of his failing health and his own desire to retire to play a behind-the-scenes role. Deng retired from his last official position in 1990 and his only post is honorary chairman of Chinas Bridge Association, a title that reflects his passion for the card game. Deng was in the public eye at the start of the new year when state television ran a 12-part documentary on his life, but without details of his present circumstances and without interviews with his wife or children. Western diplomats say the longer Deng lingers the less impact his death will have on the delicate balance of power at the top of Chinas ruling Communist Party. ","JaneMacartney"
"When the former Czechoslovak diplomat Josef Korbel died in 1977, he may have carried the secret tragedies of his Jewish heritage to the grave, but his passion for democracy lives on through his powerful daughter. As Madeleine Korbel Albright tours the globe and shards of her tumultuous family history surprise the world, it is her father's life and legacy which may quietly foreshadow things to come from the new U.S. Secretary of State. Revelations this month that three grandparents died in concentration camps surprised Albright -- born in Prague in 1937 as Marie Jana Koerbelova. She fled with her family after the 1948 Communist coup, and was raised as a Catholic. But while much of the recent focus has been on her family's Holocaust tragedies, it was her father's democratic heritage which again put the family at risk after World War Two, and apparently had the most influence on his daughter. At her swearing-in last month, Albright first thanked her mother and father ""who taught me to love freedom"", then praised Vaclav Havel, the Czech dissident-turned-president, ""who helped me to understand the responsibilities of freedom"". ""A great deal of what I did I did because I wanted to be like my father,"" Albright recently told Time magazine. As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Albright crusaded against anti-democrats, often condemning the behaviour of Cuban president Fidel Castro, Iraq's Saddam Hussein, and Serbian aggression in Bosnia. HOW POWERFUL WILL HER FATHER'S INFLUENCE BE Now the world wonders whether she will moderate her often sharp tongue as she tackles U.S. diplomatic problems from Havana to Beijing, or if she will lambast the leaders and political systems her father loathed. ""Cuba is an embarrassment to the Western Hemisphere and I think we need to keep making clear that there needs to be a change there,"" she said soon after becoming secretary of state. Josef Korbel had a direct impact on the fragile -- and eventually crushed -- inter-war experiment of Czechoslovak democracy. Friends and former colleagues said leaving his cherished homeland behind in tatters crushed him. ""Joe was, you might say, a Czech nationalist, but more importantly he was a Czech democrat and he deeply abhorred the collapse of his country,"" Professor Arthur Gilbert, who taught with Korbel at the University of Denver, told Reuters. ""His anti-communism, and his distate for the Soviet Union came from a man who really had seen both systems."" Korbel was most influenced by the father of Czechoslovak democracy, President Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, a humanist philosopher whom Korbel called ""the most profound writer and thinker of the late 19th and early 20th centuries"". In ""Twentieth Century Czechoslovakia"" published in 1977, Korbel cites Masaryk as taking the progressive step in 1918 of backing women in the national assembly, and saying that ""women should devote themselves to public activity just as men."" Korbel frequently cited Masaryk in his work after becoming a professor and eventually dean of the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Denver, when he settled with his family in Colorado in 1949. Born to a Jewish wood merchant in a northeastern Czech village in 1909, Korbel studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and then earned his law doctorate in Prague in 1933. He joined the Czechoslovak foreign service assigned as a press attache at the embassy in Belgrade. With the Nazi onslaught imminent Korbel took his family to London as the Germans occupied the Czech lands in 1939. Korbel's friendship with Masaryk's son Jan began during the war, when Korbel was information officer for the government in exile in London, and Jan Masaryk was foreign minister. Amid the Blitz, Madeleine learned to speak English and live under siege. After returning from London, and serving as ambassador to Belgrade, Korbel was stunned by the 1948 Communist takeover. He wrote that the last democratic president Edvard Benes told him in vain, days before the coup that ""I shall defend our democracy till my last breath."" Jan Masaryk died soon after the coup when he fell, jumped or pushed from a high foreign ministry window. His death is still controversial in Prague, but Korbel wrote in 1977 that Masaryk simply ""was murdered by Soviet agents"". Masaryk's death devastated him, and his return for the funeral was the last time Korbel would see his home. Before the Communists could get to him, Korbel spirited his family out of Czechoslovakia, taking asylum in the United States, and eventually a teaching post in Denver. ""Sooner or later he would have been imprisoned,"" said Antonin Sum, a former colleague of Korbel's who served in the last democratic pre-Communist foreign ministry and was imprisoned for 13 years. ""The question at that time was (Korbel) a democrat or not. He was very dangerous to the Communists."" Nearly 200 of the democrats arrested were executed by the Communists. KORBEL AN ARDENT COLD WARRIOR Korbel quickly became a fixture at the university, leading its first doctoral programme in international relations. He is remembered by his colleagues for his visceral defence of U.S. foreign policy, even in the dark days of the Vietnam War. ""He was an ardent Cold Warrior,"" said Professor Gilbert whom Korbel hired in 1961. ""The three things he cared about was what was happening in the Soviet Union, what was going on at school, and fly fishing."" Albright's often-quoted concept of ""assertive multilateralism"" in foreign policy appears to have its roots in Korbel's strong defence of U.S. involvement abroad. But Gilbert said Korbel ""was very late in the game to understand the problems about Vietnam -- well into the 60s before he started to have doubts about American involvement."" Gilbert said Korbel's house in Denver became a meeting place for informal academic policy discussions, a practice Albright carried on as a professor in Washington. Albright married newspaper heir Joseph Albright, raised three daughters while earning her doctorate, and divorced. But the Albright name is still seen alongside Korbel, not just as a maiden name kept as her middle name, but because father and daughter would quote each other in research. In 1977, the father predicted Prague's ""Velvet Revolution"" in the final words of his last book: ""The spark is still there. One cannot doubt that it will flicker one day again into flame, and freedom will return to this land that is so essentially humane...The nation will take up again its active role in mankind's never-ending struggle for freedom and social justice."" As a professor at Georgetown, Albright advised Havel after Prague's 1989 revolution which ended four decades of Communism. ","JohnMastrini"
"A campaign is being launched to recruit Hong Kong workers to help complete the territory's new airport at Chek Lap Kok (CLK), a government statement said. The recruitment campaign from December 16 to December 31 is being organised by the Hong Kong government, the Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation. A special telephone hot line is also being set up, the statement added. The new airport, offshore of Lantau island is due to open in April 1998. There have been several warnings recently that a skills shortage, especially of mechanical and electrical engineers, is threatening to delay completion of key projects. But plans to import more workers from outside Hong Kong has been met by opposition from some trade unions in the territory who said local workers should be given first choice. The government statement said the purpose of the campaign is to enable contractors to make an extensive trawl for suitable workers for job vacancies which have to be filled within three months to meet tight schedules. If local workers can't be found, applications for imported labour will be hurried through, the statement said. ""On the basis of the results of this recruitment campaign, the government will give expeditious approval for imported workers to fill any particular shortfall of labour established through the two-week recruitment excercise during this campaign,"" the statement said. The Airport Authority welcomed the government initiative. ""Given their pressing needs, it is essential that contractors have adequate numbers of workers with the right skills and experience to meet the tight programme to which we are all now working,"" Douglas Oakervee, the authority's project director said in a statement.

"Computer, give me $20. Such a demand enters the realm of possibility with the introduction Monday of a device that turns a personal computer into an automated-teller machine capable of dispensing card-based electronic cash, marking a new step in PC-based home banking. Fischer International Systems Corp. said its $60 device can be inserted into the floppy disk drive of any PC, enabling it to read ""smart cards,"" a new type of plastic credit-card that can perform electronic cash transactions and store bank account balances. Already gaining popularity in Europe to pay for store purchases and streetside telephone calls, the ""smart card"" is beginning to take hold in the United States as a replacement for cash used in ordinary purchases like grocery shopping. By enabling PCs to securely dispense money, the device may provide a major stimulus to home banking by empowering consumers to perform financial transactions that now require a visit to a bank branch or an automated teller machine. ""What's been missing is a low-cost, easy-to-use 'bridge' between smart cards and personal computers,"" Fischer President Michael Battaglia said. Smarty, as the product is known, is a slim piece of hardware that inserts into a personal computer's 3.5-inch floppy disk reader, allowing the machine to link via the Internet to banks or retail outlets. Fischer holds key patents for smart card readers inserted into 3.5 inch floppy drives -- making Smarty the most readily adaptable card reader for the 200 million personal computers now in use, company officials said. The device, which can be inserted into home or office personal computers or into a laptop computer when travelling, will enable consumers to make wider use of banking cards for purchases, replacing the need to carry loose bills and coins. The product could be a boon to PC-based home banking, permitting full-scale transactions instead of the more limited functions now available, like electronic balancing of checkbooks, financial investment tracking or tax return filing. Fischer officials said they were working with several major U.S. and European financial services firms to spur use of the devices in a variety of business and consumer applications, including home banking over the Internet. In addition, Art Burton, Fischer's vice president of sales and marketing said the company was in talks with top providers of home banking software like Intuit Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to link Smarty to their software. ""We have had some discussions at various stages with the primary providers of home banking software,"" Burton said. ""We are also working with individual banks."" Burton said the PC-based Smarty product will be offered later this year to consumers participating in a trial of smart card technology in New York City borough by a group led by MasterCard, Cititbank and Chase Manhattan Bank. In addition, Fischer said it has received initial Smarty orders from the Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, for pilot testing by bank employees. Orders for demonstration models have also come from the U.S.-based credit card consortium Visa, U.K.-based Mondex International and Sweden's Telia Group. Smart cards contain an embedded microchip capable of storing more than 4 million bytes of computer data, or dozens of pages of information -- far more than existing magnetic-strip credit cards that hold just 40 characters or so. The new financial data format can act as a one-stop shopping card storing electronic cash, a collection of credit cards, and other personal information including several forms of identification to prevent fraud. While slow to catch on in the United States, smart cards have grown popular in Europe and Asia. Fischer, with annual revenues of about $20 million, is solely owned by Addison Fischer, its chairman and a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Addison Fischer is considered one of the world's leading experts on computer security. He was one of the founders and principal owners of RSA Data Security Inc., developers of a popular computer security encryption technique. Fischer faces many larger competitors in the smart card reader market, including France's Gemplus, U.S.-based Schlumberger Ltd. and VeriFone Inc., Germany' Siemens AG and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands. But these rival machines take the form of bulky computer attachments or standalone-terminals priced between $80 and $300. ","EricAuchard"
"Ivory Coast exported 16,307 tonnes of robusta coffee beans in March, against 13,527 in February and 20,903 in March 1996, official shipping data show. Ivorian coffee marketing started later than usual in 1996/97 after low world prices in late 1996, tighter bank lending policies to exporters and quality problems that slowed grading, exporters said. ""This year is slower but there is still plenty of coffee about,"" said one industry buyer, noting that the season opened in mid-November rather than October. The data showed 12,904 tonnes of March exports went from Abidjan, the main port, with 3,403 shipped from Ivory Coast's second port of San Pedro. Cumulative exports in the first six months of the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) season were 45,783 tonnes against 58,667 in the same period of 1995/96. Coffee product exports, from Abidjan, included 694 tonnes of soluble coffee and six tonnes of roasted coffee. Ivory Coast forecast a 1996/97 crop of 230,000 tonnes, against 180,000 tonnes recorded last year. Port sources put arrivals by late March 1997 at over 175,000 tonnes but said Ivory Coast would at least meet its full year output forecast. Some buyers are still sorting and grading at stores and say more coffee is still held in villages. But they said the quality of coffee sacks had also been poor in some areas due a shortage of supply from exporters. Piles of loose coffee awaiting grading could be seen in upcountry buyers' stores last week. -- Matthew Bunce, Abidjan Newsroom +225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"China called on Japan on Thursday to stop encouraging right-wing activities on disputed South China Sea islands or risk an escalation of the diplomatic row. However, it stopped short of spelling out what action it would take over the islands -- claimed by Beijing, Tokyo and Taipei -- adding that it would exercise restraint. ""Japan should recognise the seriousness of the matter and take actions to stop these...illegal activities,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing. ""If Japan continues to encourage them the situation will be even more serious,"" he said of the right-wing activists. ""The ball is in Japan's court."" A long-dormant dispute over the islands, called the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus by Japan, erupted in July after the right-wing Japan Youth Federation erected a lighthouse on one of the islets. Friction mounted earlier this month after Japanese coast-guard ships barred private Taiwan boats from reaching the area while the rightist group repaired the typhoon-damaged structure. Beijing and Taipei have assailed Japan's protection of the rightists' activities and ordered Tokyo to keep people away from the islands that lie east of China's southeastern Fujian coast, west of Japan's Okinawa island and northeast of Taiwan. Chinese in the British colony of Hong Kong have also closed ranks, ignoring other political disputes and voicing support for Beijing's claim to the islands. On Tuesday, Beijing lodged a strong protest with Tokyo and called in the charge d'affaires in Beijing, warning of serious damage to ties if Japan failed to stop right-wingers from setting foot on the islands. Asked by reporters whether Beijing would consider stronger measures, Shen said: ""We hope this issue will be handled with restraint."" Japan on Thursday urged China, Taiwan and Hong Kong to deal calmly with the territorial dispute. A group of more than 100 Chinese nationalists on Wednesday urged China's top military brass to send warships to the disputed Diaoyu islands to tear down structures built by Japanese rightists. The response of China's military commission, which is headed by Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin, was not immediately available. Hong Kong activists, members of the pro-democracy Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, were in Beijing to present to Chinese authorities a petition signed by 17,000 people urging the government to get tough on Japan's claim to the islands. In Taiwan on Thursday, fishermen hurled rotten fish at Japan's Taipei visa office in protest over Tokyo's actions in the dispute. ","WilliamKazer"
"Rational Software Corp., expanding its expertise in offering software programming products, said Monday it agreed to buy rival Pure Atria Corp. in a stock deal initially valued at about $839 million. But both companies' stocks plunged after Pure Atria said its first-quarter earnings would be far less than Wall Street expected because of the difficulty the company has had managing its own recent acquisitions. Rational could have the same difficulties, analysts said. ""We're looking at a lot of questions about why the hell Rational would do this when they appeared to be winning the war with Pure Atria anyway,"" said Kris Tuttle, analyst at Soundview Financial Group. Rational Software's stock fell $10.125, or 43 percent, to $13.25, while Pure Atria's stock fell $7.375, or 42 percent, to $10.375 on the Nasdaq, where both were among the biggest percentage losers and the most actively traded stocks on the exchange. Under terms of the acquisition, Rational would pay 0.9 of its shares for each of Pure Atria's 39.92 million shares outstanding. Based on Rational's Friday closing stock price of $23.375, the transaction would be worth $839 million. Monday's stock slide slashed the deal's value by 43 percent. Both companies write development tools, a type of software that helps programmers write other software. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Rational specialises in methodology tools, which help programmers design the skeleton of complex software projects. Pure Atria specialises in development and testing tools, which let programmers write and test chunks of software code. The acquisition would give Rational all the components a big developer would need to write commercial-quality software, said Stan Dolberg, director of software strategies of market researcher Forrester Research Inc. But Rational is placing its bets on rigid, industrial-strength development tools at an awkward time. Rational and other development tool vendors face a fundamental threat from Java, a programming language that is all the rage among Internet and computer networking software developers, who do not need such rigid tools. ""My suspicion is that there are a lot of developers waiting to see what happens with Java,"" said Catlin Wolfard, analyst at brokerage Aracdia Investment Corp. in Portland, Ore. ""Every stock chart in the development market is down, down, down this year"" because of lower earnings prospects as big development tool purchases are put off. Rational also is buying a company that has had a hard time managing its own acquisitions, analysts said. Pure Atria's trouble could now be Rational's, Andrew Roskill, analyst at Smith Barney, told the brokerage's clients Monday. Pure Atria, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was formed last August when Atria Software Inc. bought Pure Software Inc. The companies still are struggling to meld their operations. Partly because of the difficult merger, Pure Atria said it expected first-quarter earnings to be between 2 cents to 4 cents a share, compared with 9 cents in the same quarter a year ago. Wall Street expected earnings of 12 cents, according to First Call, which tracks such estimates. Rational executives said they viewed this as the right time to buy Pure Atria. The acquisition will accelerate Rational's expansion into the testing market, said Jerry Rudisin, Rational's vice president of corporate marketing. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Czech engineering group Skoda a.s. said Tuesday it won an order to supply more than $170 million in buses to the city of San Francisco, the largest supply of Czech goods ever to the United States. Skoda spokesman Jaroslav Hudec said the electric-powered buses would be produced in the Czech Republic and assembled at Skoda's subsidiary, Electric Transit International in Baltimore. ""We consider victory in this tender to be an extraordinary success not only in view of the expected volumes of supplies ... but also because the U.S. market is among the most prestigious and demanding in the world,"" Hudec said. Plzen-based Skoda, no longer affiliated with the Czech car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s., has made an aggressive push into new markets, aiming to offer western-quality units with the comparative cost advantage of eastern European production. The San Francisco contract would open the way for Skoda, an engineering conglomerate that makes goods ranging from nuclear power components to drink cans, to win more business in the United States, Hudec said. ""Considering the ecologization of public transport in the U.S., Skoda Plzen has real chances to win further orders ... and also bring the brand Skoda to the U.S. market in relation to other production of our factories,"" he said. Skoda has made over 12,000 buses since 1936 -- many of which run in cities throughout the former communist bloc. Local Czech media reports quoted ETI officials as saying the San Francisco order could be for about 250 single-section and higher capacity buses. The total order will be finalised by mid-year, Hudec said. Earlier this decade Skoda won a contract to supply 54 buses to the city of Dayton, Ohio, and founded ETI, a U.S. joint venture with private partners in Baltimore, to assemble the buses. Skoda holds a majority stake in ETI. The Dayton project is to be completed in 1998. Skoda said it is also pursuing joint ventures to build buses in Russian and Iran. ","JanLopatka"
"War baby Yegue Badigue was born at one of Chad's darkest hours. To make matters worse, a hereditary defect struck him blind when he was little more than a year old. But the boy who entered the world as Libyan and Chadian forces fought over the sprawling desert nation's capital in 1980 had a hidden talent -- the gift of music. ""We started Yegue off on Do-Re-Mi and he just started improvising with melodies,"" his father Jean Badigue, a soldier and director of Chad's army band, told Reuters. ""Then we gave him a harmonica and soon realised he was no ordinary child."" Today, Yegue's musical talent is helping build bridges within the former French colony's blind community -- which some say is the world's largest as a percentage of the population. His teachers, who have brought together children from Chad's rival Moslem and Christian communities, offer his case as a symbol of hope -- in a country starting to enjoy relative stability after decades of civil war or conflict with Libya. ""He joined the first of our mixed-religion classes and learned the piano in five years flat,"" said Roman Catholic Archbishop Jean Williet, who took over N'Djamena's diocese in 1986 and has taken a special interest in his case. MUSIC ""HOLDS US TOGETHER"" ""We cannot see each other so music for us is as solid as sight for others. It holds us together,"" said Yegue, 16, who is dependent on others -- until he sits at his piano. Williet runs three blind centres around the capital. ""We had to do something as no one had ever reached out to the blind community,"" he said, bouncing his battered Peugeot through dusty backstreets from school to school. ""Chad after all has the highest blind population per head in the world."" World Health Organisation figures show that 135,000 of Chad's 6.5 million are blind -- a third of them aged under 20. Many live by begging. Williet says many cases of blindness are preventable. Children become blind because of untreated early diseases such as chickenpox, measles and dangerous concoctions prescribed to clear symptoms, he adds. Poor hygiene is a factor. Others, like Yegue, simply go blind for hereditary reasons. Williet started Yegue on the piano by guiding his hands over a piano keyboard to teach him elementary theory and practice by feel and sound. ""We had an old Russian grand in those days but later scraped together the money for an electric piano so we could take it about with us,"" Williet said. PLAYS TO INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCES Before long Yegue was lifting the roof of N'Djamena's vast Notre Dame cathedral with the strains of Bach, Mozart or the Little Prince of Africa -- a piece composed by Williet himself. Yegue, little over five feet (1.5 metres) tall and as thin as a reed, now plays to international audiences at the capital's plushest hotels. ""He played to a 400-strong audience of Lion's Club charities at Christmas,"" said Williet. ""They were dumb-struck."" Yegue is one of 55 students aged from six to 20 in Williet's schools. They follow a full curriculum ranging from maths, braille and French to carpentry and basket weaving. The aim is to integrate them into normal schools or a craft-based career. Religious instruction is optional. Yegue's father says his son will have to decide what he wants to do next. Yegue himself already has plans. ""I hope to be a teacher or go to music school,"" he said, his eyes fixed blankly on a wall as he raced through Franz Kuhlan's Sonata Opus 55. Other blind children are following his example. A full band of Moslem and Christian drummers, guitarists, singers and actors perform regularly in N'Djamena. ""He is a real symbol for peace time and how the community can work together after 30 years of war,"" said Williet. ","MatthewBunce"
"Australian-based pallet hire and logistics group Brambles Industries Ltd loaded up another strong first-half profit rise on Friday, but was quick to warn investors not to expect such strength in the second half. Brambles chief executive John Fletcher said slow European and Australian economies, along with a smaller boost from lower net interest costs, would slow growth in the second half. Fletcher told Reuters analysts should not get too excited by a better-than-expected first-half result and should hold on to the full-year profit forecasts they made before the result. ""The message is that the existing market expectations for the full year that were there before this announcement, they're still looking okay,"" Fletcher said. He said the average of the Barceps survey of analysts' forecasts for the 1996/97 year to June 30 was A$240.3 million (US$186.2 million) This would be a near 12 percent rise for the full year on the A$214.8 million pre-abnormal net profit posted in 1995/96. Earlier, Brambles reported its first-half net profit before abnormals rose 14.8 percent to A$117.2 million. There were no abnormal profits or losses in the period. Brambles also raised its dividend to 35 cents a share from 34 cents. Fletcher said the higher profit reflected strong growth in North America and higher earnings despite difficult conditions in Australia and Europe. Revenue fell A$145 million to A$1.454 billion in the half. ""Lower net interest resulting from the proceeds of the sale of under-performing activities in Australia and Europe, and lower interest rates, also contributed to the overall improvement,"" Fletcher said. Net interest expenses fell to A$22.3 million from A$32.3 million in the half because debt was repaid after asset sales. Brambles said its Australian units continued to perform sluggishly overall, ""with little evidence of an improvement in those areas of the economy in which the company operates"". Subdued economic conditions in continental Europe continued to affect growth from Brambles' European activites, it said. ""But this was offset by the good gains achieved by the CHEP (pallet hire) and Cleanaway joint ventures,"" Brambles said. Brambles' CHEP joint venture is with Britain's GKN Plc. Brambles said it experienced good profit growth from its U.S. activities. Earnings before interest, tax and abnormals at U.S. operations rose to A$26.2 million in the half from A$17.8 million in the same period a year earlier. ""If only I had three Americas,"" Fletcher said. Brambles said it was talking to General Electric Capital and General Electric Plastics about the supply and leasing of plastic pallets in the United States and Europe. It said it had worked with various parties on the development of a plastic pallet, but had yet to find a pallet as strong, durable or cheap as wood. Fletcher told Reuters that Brambles was a lot closer to finding an acceptable plastic pallet this year than in previous years. ""We could be within 12 months of finding something,"" he said. Brambles shares closed unchanged on Friday at A$21.70, after having earlier risen to an intra-day high of A$21.94. (A$ = US$0.77) ","BernardHickey"
"In a show that Deng Xiaoping may not have wanted, China's state television gave his 1.2 billion people a lingering last look at the body of their deceased patriarch on Monday as official mourning moved into high gear. Draped with the crimson hammer-and-sickle flag of Chinese communism and showered with flower petals, the body was shown lying in state at Beijing's 301 Military Hospital as grim-faced leaders and weeping relatives filed past. Deng, who died on Wednesday aged 92, had expressly forbidden the elaborate public grieving that has attended the deaths of top Chinese leaders in the past. But China Central Television's main evening newscast, the most widely watched broadcast in the country, effectively overruled him by devoting its main evening news to emotional scenes of farewells to his body before its cremation on Monday. Pale and puffy, the body was repeatedly shown lying on a bier surrounded by grieving members of China's elite and elaborate funeral wreaths of plastic flowers. Soviet-trained technocrat President Jiang Zemin, Deng's hand-picked successor, led an official group of mourners that included all members of the ruling Communist Party politburo and other senior government and party leaders. Jiang, looking ill at ease, shook hands with Deng's weeping family but said nothing. He led the mourners in the three traditional bows of respect to the body and is expected to read the eulogy at official memorial rites in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday. After a slow and stately funeral cortege to the Babaoshan cemetery where revolutionary veterans are traditionally cremated, Deng's body lying in a glass-topped bier was carried into a final anteroom by an honour guard of eight soldiers.. Sonorous music played in the background as Deng's grey-haired wife, Zhuo Lin, and other family members were shown sobbing and wailing. One of his three daughters, Deng Nan, bent down to embrace and kiss her father's forehead, clinging to his body. Another daughter, Deng Rong, cried out ""You are not dead!"" The television pictures seemed clearly aimed at stirring an emotional response among the 1.2 billion people Deng ruled for 18 years, but who have shown little open grief at his death last week at the age of 92. People lining the funeral courtege's route from the hospital to the cemetery -- most of whom were marshalled to attend by their work units -- were shown crying quietly and tenderly affixing white paper flowers of mourning to their jackets. In sobbing interviews, one after another pledged to honour Deng's memory and to forge ahead with his ideals. ""Scatter Hot Tears for Comrade Xiaoping"" read one banner held by mourners along the route. ","ScottHillis"
"David Jones, chief executive of British fashion retailer Next Plc, on Monday rejected as nonsense press reports that he had been approached by headhunters to take over the top job at Sears. Some shareholders at stores group Sears are disgruntled with the dismal performance of the group and are calling for a radical shake-up including a demerger of its very profitable Selfridges department store and the sale of the struggling British Shoe Corporation. Sears was back in the spotlight last week when it issued a profit warning and reported disappointing Christmas sales, leading to suggestions that chief executive Liam Strong's job was on the line. The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported that Jones was offered the job of chief executive of Sears but had decided to turn it down. But Jones told Reuters in an interview on his carphone, ""I'm very happy in my current job. I am not intending to leave Next. As far as I am concerned no one is headhunting me for any job."" Although Sears sold its mail order business Freemans earlier this month to Littlewoods  LWD.CN for 395 million pounds ($656 million) and pledged to return about 410 million in cash to shareholders in six months' time, some investors are calling for deeper changes. Sears shares, which traded at 90p on Monday, have underperformed the stockmarket by over 40 percent since Strong took the helm five years ago. Jones is accredited with rescuing Next from the brink of collapse in the early 1990s -- in the midst of Britain's deepest recession since the second world war -- by combining a sell-off programme of non-core assets, such as mail order business Grattan, and a sharper focus on the main brand. He sold shops and merged others, improving the Next profile on the high street and reducing shoppers' confusion about the range and type of products on sale. On December 6, 1990, Next shares reached a low of 7p compared with 573p today. Next now has a return on equity of 32.49 percent, against 12.5 percent at Burton Group, 11.79 percent at Laura Ashley, and 9.54 percent at Sears. Sears also rejected press reports that headhunters had been appointed by the company charged with finding Strong's replacement. ""We have not employed any headhunters. The chairman and the board are strongly supportive of Liam Strong,"" said a spokeswoman at Sears. ""We are not seeking a replacement for Liam."" Sears last week reported like-for-like sales at its troubled British Shoe Corporation unit, owner of Dolcis, Shoe Express and Shoe City, fell 2.8 percent in the six months to January 6. ""We are just about at the end of our tether,"" said one small shareholder, who declined to be named. ""It just seems like nothing goes right for them.""

"Hainan Airlines plans to buy 10 airliners from Boeing Corp in the next two years in a major fleet expansion to be funded by bonds, loans and China's first public airline share issue, company officials said. The regional airline, which is based in the southern tropical island province of Hainan, had already agreed on a basic contract with the U.S. planemaker for four 737-400s and three 737-800s, said airline chairman and president Chen Feng. Hainan Airlines was also waiting for approval from China's aviation authorities to buy three Boeing 767 aircraft for around $60-70 million each, Chen told Reuters in an interview in the provincial capital, Haikou. Delivery of both the Boeing 737s and 767s was expected to begin in 1998, when Hainan Airlines also planned to bring into operation seven new Metro 23 light aircraft from U.S. manufacturer Fairchild Aircraft Inc, company officials said. ""Next year we plan to take about 20 aircraft,"" Chen said. ""It's big money... minimum $600 million."" The airline, which currently operates nine Boeing 737s and a handful of turboprops and executive jets, would take out options on a further three 737-800s, said chief economist Li Bing. ""We have hired a lot of new pilots,"" Li said. Part of the cost of the new aircraft would be covered by the airline's planned issue of about 80 million foreign currency B shares to be listed on the Shanghai bourse in the first quarter of this year, company officials said. The issue, originally scheduled for last year, is expected to make Hainan the first airline to list publicly on one of China's two domestic exchanges. The airline hoped to list two million domestic currency A shares in Shanghai shortly after issuing the dollar-denominated B shares, raising at least $30 million, Chen said. ""The money we get for the shares we will certainly use for fleet expansion,"" said economist Li, adding that proceeds would also be directed toward training and recruitment and would be far from enough to cover major aircraft purchases. The airline planned to issue $300 million in bonds in the United States to help to finance fleet expansion and expected financial support from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, said Chen. Li said the airline, which is 25 percent owned by American Aviation Investment, a fund partially controlled by U.S. financier George Soros, was waiting for approval from China's aviation authorities before signing the 737 deal. Company officials said the turbulent diplomatic relationship between Washington and Beijing could sometimes make buying U.S. jets a sensitive political issue, but such considerations were not expected to delay approval of the 737 deal. Sino-U.S. ties have warmed sharply in recent months, bolstered by high-level contacts and a January visit by U.S. congressmen that U.S. diplomats said helped to hasten the sale this month of two Boeing 747s to flagship carrier Air China. That deal was followed on Monday by Boeing's announcement of a $68 million order for two 737s from China's Yunnan Airlines. Hainan Airlines officials said they had seriously considered buying from Boeing's European arch-rival Airbus Industrie but had been put off by the training and technical costs of a switch from the U.S. manufacturer.

"The Czech Republic appeared headed for its first budget deficit despite earlier reports by the fiscally-tough government that it had achieved a surplus in 1996 for the fourth successive year. ""(We expect) the definitive results for 1996 will range around a deficit of 1.7 billion crowns ($61.77 million),"" Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said on Wednesday in testimony to parliament's budget committtee. The Czechs have had three surplus budgets since Czechoslovakia split in two in 1993. Final data were due in the ministry on Wednesday but as local media paid close attention to whether Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus would maintain his fiscal winning streak, Havel said the trend was not positive. He said that by Wednesday revenues totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.5 billion. More bills may be delivered after the deadline, inflating expenditures further, Havel said. The government made last-ditch efforts in December when the budget looked headed for a more than five billion crown deficit, by freezing some outlays until 1997, and requiring early repayment on credit granted to a deposit insurance fund. The budget has been hampered by lower-than-expected tax revenue and delayed repayment on credits to Russia. The 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of spending cuts knocked the spending forecast down to 491 billion crowns. Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome, but he was concerned with the effects government payment adjustments might have on the 1997 budget. The December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which were due to the partly-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s. Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the ""alpha and omega"" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus, made by the finance ministry soon after the new year, as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility. Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with spending and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997. But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for 1996. Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep at bay a deficit much larger than that for 1996. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=27.52 Czech Crown) ","JanLopatka"
"Allegiance Corp chief financial officer Peter McKee said the company is comfortable with a Wall Street consensus 1997 earnings estimate of $1.55 per share, compared to 1996 operating earnings of $1.15 per share. The consensus estimate that's out on the street at the present time is about $1.55 ... That would be consistent with the long-term goal,"" McKee said in a Reuters interview.   Gross profit margin for Allegiance was 20.4 pct for the fourth quarter. ""There's continued pressure on it. We don't know exactly where it's going to fall, but we feel that it will be in that twenty range,"" McKee said. In the same interview, Allegiance chief executive Lester Knight said the company is seeing some price increases on the distribution side of its business. But, he added, ""Some of the manufactured products have continued to have a lot of competitive pressure and we've seen some prices decline."" Sales for 1996 were about $4.38 billion. ""Our sales for 1997 will be roughly flat,"" McKee said.   In 1998 and beyond, Allegiance expects to match or slightly exceed the market growth rate of two to three percent, McKee said. Flat 1997 sales were expected as part of a plan to shift into more profitable businesses, Knight said. The company's effective income tax rate was 35 percent in the fourth quarter, McKee said. ""We had 35 percent in the fourth quarter and we would anticipate having a tax rate in that magnitude going forward,"" he said. The net debt-to-capital ratio was about 57 percent in the fourth quarter. ""We still want to get it down into the mid-40s over time,"" McKee said, declining to give a deadline.   While still a small expense for Allegiance, research and development was $8.1 million in 1996, up from $6.6 million in 1995. ""We anticipate increasing that by roughly 25 percent to close to $10 million in '97. Over the next few years, you will see us putting a little more emphasis on R&amp;D,"" McKee said. Knight said Allegiance expects soon to announce another Best Value Product distribution program with the Kendall International Inc unit of Tyco International Ltd. ""You're going to see a deal with Kendall announced very shortly,"" Knight said.   He said a price war in the hospital supply distribution industry involving Allegiance, spun off in September from Baxter International Inc, and competitors has wound down. ""The whole industry has come to the bottom of that price war and has started to expand those distribution margins ... I would say that price war is over,"" Knight said. Allegiance is eyeing some possible acquisitions to expand its self-manufactured products business, he said.

"News Corp Ltd shares soared on Tuesday after Rupert Murdoch's media empire struck a deal with satellite TV group EchoStar Communications Corp to offer U.S. subscription television service. News Corp shares were the most actively sought in Australia, with over A$120 million (US$93 million) worth traded. News' ordinary shares jumped 37 cents or 5.51 percent to A$7.09 and non-voting preferred shares 40 cents or 7.1 percent to A$6.03. ""It is a bit of a manic depressive this stock. It has been depressed for the past 18 months and now it is about to go manic,"" said Greg Matthew, executive director of equities at fund managers Mercantile Mutual. Under the deal, News Corp, which owns the U.S. Fox television network, would contribute satellites, cash and other assets of US$1 billion from its American Sky Broadcasting (AskyB) unit in return for a 50-percent stake in EchoStar. MCI Communications Corp, a partner in ASkyB, will acquire a portion of News Corp's stake in the venture, bringing News Corp's ownership to 40 percent compared with 10 percent for MCI and 50 percent for EchoStar. The deal is estimated to be worth about A$2.6 billion to Murdoch's media empire or about 65 cents per News Corp share, one Sydney-based broker said. Officials with both companies said the alliance would enable the company to respond to the growing popularity for pay television services, currently dominated by cable TV operators. ""Our goal is not to be complimentary to cable, we want to eliminate cable,"" said Charles Ergen, chief executive officer of EchoStar. The service is scheduled to start service early 1998. ""Jointly we will create a dynamic and promising new competitive force in the subscription marketplace,"" Murdoch said in a statement. The alliance will operate under the Sky name and is expected to lose around $500 million in its first year but it should reach break-even by 1999 and generate more than $1 billion in operating cash flow by the year 2002, the companies said. ""Everyone thought AskyB would break even probably as far out as 2003, they are now saying it would break even by 1999, so the market quite likes that,"" the Sydney broker said. Brokers said they also liked News Corp's comments that it planned to sell US$800 million of non-core assets and that it had raised its earnings forecast for its U.S. TV interests by $500 million over the next three years. The new Sky service is expected to include seven satellites, more than 500 channels, retransmission of local TV stations in markets representing more than 75 percent of all U.S. television households and low consumer entry cost. The deal is also likely to step up the challenge to existing U.S. satellite television operators, DirecTV, which is owned by General Motors Corp's Hughes Electronics and AT&amp;T Corp and Primestar, which is owned by a group of cable TV operators. News Corp, also controls Britain's leading pay-TV provider BSkyB and has a satellite TV joint venture in Japan, JSkyB, that is expected to begin full service next year. Murdoch also confirmed at a news conference after the deal announcement that News Corp has held friendly talks with Japanese electronics and entertainment gaint Sony Corp about Sony acquiring a stake in JSkyB. News Corp ordinary shares closed at a three month high, while the preferred shares ended at a four month high. (A$=US$.7750) ","KevinMorrison"
"South Korea on Tuesday urged ""extraordinary alertness"" against the rival North, warning that the defection of a senior North Korean official now marooned in Seoul's Beijing embassy showed the hermit state was unstable. As China reinforced security at the South Korean mission, there was little sign of progress in the diplomatic deadlock with the two rival Koreas on what to do with Hwang Jang-yop, the most senior North Korean to betray his Stalinist homeland. It was Hwang's seventh day in Seoul's consulate office. Appeals for calm from China, an unwilling third party in the latest Cold War crisis, appeared to yield fruit with North Korea showing signs of backing off from its hard line over its highest ever defector. But South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung called for ""extraordinary alertness"" against the North. ""The defection of secretary Hwang Jang-yop, who belongs to the core force of the North Korean leadership, vividly displays the shaking of the ideological foundation that has supported the North Korean system amid economic disasters,"" he said. Hwang, one of 11 powerful secretaries of the ruling Workers' Party along with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, sought refuge at Seoul's mission in the Chinese capital last Wednesday. Lee told parliament the communist North had increasingly deployed offensive forces near the border with the South, despite an economic crisis and chronic food shortage at home. While repeating its appeals for calm, China was prepared for disturbances. Police guarding the mission where Hwang is stranded went on higher alert, and three armoured personnel carriers filled with helmeted paramilitary police rumbled into the sedate diplomatic quarter to back up squads of police armed with assault rifles. ""We hope all parties can deal with this matter calmly... and calmly face and appropriately handle this incident to maintain peace and stability in the Korean peninsula,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Seoul and Beijing were working to find a solution to the three-way diplomatic crisis that has thrown relations among China and the two Koreas into turmoil, Seoul officials said. ""Negotiations with the Chinese government are still going on,"" said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik, but declined to give details. He dismissed reports that three-way talks between Beijing, its old communist ally Pyongyang and its new capitalist friend Seoul were under way to break the deadlock over Hwang's fate. The North has hinted it may accept Hwang's defection, saying it would dismiss him if he sought asylum. ""It is certain North Korea is changing its attitude,"" said Kim Kyung-woong, a senior official of Seoul's state South-North Dialogue Office. North Korea's Foreign Ministry said late on Monday it would fire Hwang if he sought asylum in Seoul but warned of ""decisive countermeasures"" if it were proved he had been kidnapped. North Korea had earlier maintained Seoul kidnapped Hwang, architect of the Stalinist nation's governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance. Seoul called the charge preposterous. The tussle over Hwang's defection was the latest flare-up in tense relations between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 Korean civil war ended only in a truce. The United States has urged Pyongyang to avoid all provocative actions and has said it was closely monitoring developments after an assassination attempt against a former North Korean defector near Seoul on Saturday night. South Korea accused Pyongyang agents of shooting 32-year-old Li Il-nam in an attack that left him critically ill with a bullet still lodged in his skull. Doctors in Seoul said he was on life support and unlikely to regain consciousness. ","JaneMacartney"
"China said Monday that it restrained inflation while maintaining strong economic growth in 1996 and it predicted it will do even better next year despite soaring government-sector losses and slumping individual incomes. The State Statistical Bureau quoted preliminary 1996 figures showing China's gross domestic product grew at an estimated 9.7 percent to 6.8 trilliion yuan ($816 billion) while inflation fell to 6.0 percent from 14.8 percent. Despite soaring losses in the state sector and falling incomes for many urban households, the statistics showed China's economy had returned safely to earth after a period of high inflation and runaway growth, bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said. ""The national economy maintained its rapid and stable growth, indicating a successful 'soft landing,'"" Ye told a news conference in Beijing. China will do even better in 1997, he said. ""Preliminary estimates show overall growth will continue with the same stability and high speed as this year,"" he said. Annual economic growth in 1997 was expected to rise to 10.5 percent, while inflation -- which soared to a communist-era high of 21.4 percent in 1994 -- will stay at this year's level, Ye said. China has set a target of 8.0 percent growth for 1996 to try to cool the economy, down from 10.2 percent last year and a sizzling 11.8 percent the previous year. The 6.0 percent figure for 1996 retail price inflation, China's benchmark price index, was well below the government's 10 percent target for the year. Consumer price inflation was estimated at about 8.3 percent, compared with 17.1 percent in 1995. While some economists have expressed doubts about the accuracy of Beijing's inflation figures, it was clear that once-fierce price rises have been largely controlled, said Jason Kwok, chief economist at Citibank Hong Kong and China. ""It all tends to suggest that the macroeconomy is doing very well this year,"" Kwok said in a telephone interview. Two recent interest rate cuts and China's second-half turnaround of an earlier poor export performance meant growth could edge up next year even without a loosening of Beijing's 42-month-old tight credit policy, Kwok said. Stable growth next year was likely to receive an external boost from an expected upward trend in exports, which the statistical bureau said had powered China to an estimated $16 billion trade surplus in 1996, he said. Beijing will keep the lid on credit growth and continue to put high priority on restraining price rises, Ye said. ","MureDickie"
"A spectre of central planning seems to have settled over Hong Kong just as its future sovereign, China, tries to loosen the last chains of Stalinist economic doctrine. Economic intervention heads the agenda of a number of hand-picked advisers to future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa, many of them urging action to keep Hong Kong competitive in a region full of booming Asian ""tiger"" states. Proposals so far include a government-funded science park, tax breaks to lure multinationals, a venture capital fund for high-tech businesses and most recently, a cross-border zone with an industrial park on the Hong Kong side and would-be immigrants on the Chinese side. It all suggests a major policy shift on July 1, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control -- and a marked departure from the sort of free-wheeling past that saw Hong Kong dubbed ""the world's freest economy"" by the U.S.-backed Heritage Foundation. The idea of state funding for business is anathema to Hong Kong, where a strict separation between government and business has long been considered essential to economic success. ""Hong Kong is like a Rolls Royce. All you need to do if you're in charge is slip into the drivers's seat, switch on the ignition, and away you go. I don't quite see the point of lifting the bonnet to tinker with the engine,"" said departing colonial governor Chris Patten. Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, the man who balances the territory's books, recently gave a speech pledging government help for the economy -- but only after the private sector had taken the lead. A SIGN OF THE TIMES ... AND NEW FACES This is a hot topic in Hong Kong as it speeds towards unification with China on July 1. It is also one of the most important signs that faces are changing along with the times. Over the past 15 years Hong Kong's economic success was virtually guaranteed by its location next to southern China's economic boom, the biggest on record. But wage rates in southern China are no longer cheap. Vietnam and central Chinese provinces closer to Shanghai now offer lower pay than Guangdong, and even tougher competitors lurk on the horizon in India and elsewhere. Hong Kong already suffers from stratospheric wage rates and property prices. And with most large Asian centres scrambling for service income higher up the economic food-chain, Hong Kong faces stiff competition from rival ""baby dragons"" such as Singapore. Unnerved by an almost complete dependence upon services, Singapore recently altered its foreign exchange policy to support a lagging industrial base and declining exports. Over the past 15 years, Hong Kong has experienced a similar decline in its own export base. Services now account for a rising 85 percent of gross domestic product while domestic exports continue to decline. They are being replaced by soaring re-exports, goods shipped through Hong Kong for processing -- most of them to China -- in a trend that reflects the relocation of virtually Hong Kong's entire manufacturing base into southern China. It all begs the question of just how vulnerable Hong Kong wants to become to the fundamental economics of regions outside its immediate influence. Economists say diversification is a good idea to minimise risk associated with such a high dependence upon services, and opportunities could become more available after July 1. Hong Kong entrepreneurs could soon gain easier access to Chinese land and labour that will enable the development of a high-tech sector, said economist Kevin Chan at Salomon Brothers. ""After July 1 we may be able to draw directly on resources from the mainland that would enable us to develop a high-tech manufacturing sector,"" he said. ""We will have a better foundation on which to do this."" SHAPING HONG KONG IN THEIR OWN IMAGE Many of the well-educated, well-heeled businessmen who hold Tung's confidence believe that intervention is essential to secure Hong Kong's long-term future. With HK$330 billion (US$42.3 billion) in fiscal reserves, they have the means as well as the determination to effect great change. And if there is any opposition to the new proposals, it is unlikely to win a sympathetic hearing. Most of these privileged tycoons and technocrats espouse elitist, almost anti-democratic views, having been raised in the autocratic, do-or-die tradition of Asian family business. ""There has been too much pandering to public opinion by the legislature,"" Leung Chun-ying, the property surveyor asked to map out a long-term housing strategy for the territory, told the Far Eastern Economic Review recently. Two sources have been most outspoken about the new mood of intervention that marks the men closest to Tung. Henry Tang, head of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and a member of Tung's inner cabinet, is reported to have been asked to map out an industrial policy for Hong Kong. James Tien, a pro-intervention businessman, is a high-profile member of the Provisional Legislature, the interim body that will replace the existing legislature on July 1. ","SarahDavison"
"The French government is moving edgily towards a key decision for the future of Europe's defence industry -- whether to privatise defence electronics group Thomson-CSF through a public sale or private placement. The stakes are huge, as the choice of the method of sale will to a large extent determine the final outcome of a far-reaching restructuring in the French defence industry and has major implications for the entire sector in Europe. Like a master chess player, the state must look several moves ahead, decide what sort of defence industry it wants to see in a few years' time, and ensure the decision will be seen as fair to all involved. Government sources said on Friday that the decision, originally expected at the end of January, would probably slip into early February because the government was studying in great detail all the elements of the politically-sensitive dossier that involves Europe's biggest defence electronics company. ""The decision will be taken shortly, but not today. We are still studying all possibilities,"" said an official source. ""The decision will have to be taken by the cabinet. At the moment there is no proposal to send to the ministers. I could not tell you when exactly that will happen,"" he added. Prime Minister Alain Juppe is anxious to avoid another embarassment like the one he suffered on December 4 when the government had to suspend an earlier privatisation plan under which Thomson-CSF would have gone to conglomerate Lagardere Groupe. That deal involved the privatisation of the Thomson group, which included both a 68 percent stake in Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM). The state was forced to call off the plan because the independent privatisation commission balked at the terms of a sale of TMM to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics. The cancellation outraged the Korean, who called the decision racist and prompted an angry call for explanation from President Kim Young-sam. Since then the French government has decided to separate the sales of TMM and Thomson-CSF. The ultimate aim of the government is to have a strong defence industry able to supply its armed forces with state-of-the art weaponry and play a leading role in Europe and on the world scene. A year ago, President Jacques Chirac announced a wide-ranging restructuring of the French defence industry around a merged group of Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation for aerospace, and Thomson-CSF for electronics. In France alone, any such restructuring would affect the business of Lagardere, owner of Matra Espace Defense with British Aerospace Plc as a partner, Alcatel Alsthom and its ally GEC Plc, and smaller groups such as Sagem and Compagnie des Signaux. With a public sale through a market float, Thomson-CSF management will have its hands free to pursue its own negotiations about future alliances while interested partners can acquire stakes on the market. But this may mean that a foreign cash-rich group from elsewhere in Europe or from the U.S. or Asia could buy itself into the talks. With a private placement there are two main options. One is by choosing candidates for a sale using a ""cahier de charges"" -- a sort of bidding book comprising price, intended strategy and commitments on jobs and investments. This would leave the government with the biggest influence on the outcome, but also with the biggest responsibilty. Another procedure, rare in France, would be to auction the state's 68-percent stake in Thomson-CSF among qualified bidders, putting the emphasis on price and ensuring the greatest possible revenues for the state at a time France is trying to reduce its public deficits ahead of monetary union.

"Newcastle United said on Thursday that it would seek to raise up to 50 million pounds ($84 million) when it joins the growing band of British soccer clubs on the stock market. But the plan for a flotation this spring does not mean that new team manager Kenny Dalglish, who was appointed to succeed Kevin Keegan on Tuesday, is about to embark on a spending spree. ""We believe we have arguably one of the best playing squads in Europe and we are not entering a phase of substantial incremental investment,"" joint chief executive Mark Corbidge told Reuters. The announcement follows a dramatic few days for the northeast English club which hired former Liverpool and Blackburn boss Dalglish after Keegan's resignation last week. Keegan had spent around 60 million pounds in recent seasons as he turned Newcastle into a potent footballing force but he failed to win any major honours. Potential investors will be reassured that Sir John Hall, whose millions have helped to bring stars such as England's Alan Shearer, Frenchman David Ginola and Colombian Faustino Asprilla to Newcastle, is to remain as chairman of the club. But NatWest Markets, which is organising the flotation, said a new non-executive chairman would be named for the holding company. Property magnate Hall, whose Cameron Hall investment company owns a controlling stake in the club, plans to devote his time to developing a centre of excellence for young players. The club plans to raise 40-50 million pounds through the issue of new shares and analysts expect the value of the club as a whole to total some 160 million pounds when it joins the stock exchange. Trading in the shares is likely to begin by April. That would make it the second biggest British listed club, behind English champions Manchester United, valued at in excess of 400 million pounds. The trend for soccer club flotations appears to be spreading across Europe, with reports in Italy on Thursday that European champions Juventus, controlled by Fiat's Agnelli family, would soon seek a market listing. However, the club owners later denied the report. Paul Deakin, a director of corporate finance at NatWest Markets, said that the Hall family would remain major stakeholders after the flotation. Asked about the use of the flotation proceeds, Deakin said that some would be used to pay off debts but that cash would be left over to fund the club's future development. ""The money has not been earmarked for one cause, there is a lot of flexibility,"" he said, adding that the club planned to invest in its commercial activity and the centre of excellence. Deakin dismissed suggestions that Newcastle might have to issue more shares to pay for a planned move to a new stadium, which is likely to cost 65 million pounds. Newcastle revealed that its interests in local rugby union, ice hockey and basketball teams had been sold last July to a company controlled by some of its directors. It said they were sold because they were at an early stage in their commercial development and would require substantial further investment before producing a significant return. Newcastle United reported a group operating profit from continuing operations of 5.9 million pounds for the year to end-July 1996 on 29 million pounds of turnover. However, that profit excluded the huge cost of transfer fees. At least 10 percent of new shares will be available to Newcastle's fans, for a minimum investment of 500 pounds. The club is still in contention for the premier league title plus the F.A. and UEFA Cups this season. Newcastle have not won the championship for 70 years but Dalglish is a winner, having led Liverpool and Blackburn to the title. ","KeithWeir"
"3Com Corp. stock lost more than a quarter of its value Monday after the computer networking equipment maker said its fiscal third-quarter earnings will be less than Wall Street had expected. 3Com, the nation's second largest networking vendor, also had to respond to rising competition from PC component powerhouse Intel Corp. by sharply cutting prices of its so-called ethernet network products, from which it derives 43 percent of its revenue. The move fuelled even more concern among investors about 3Com's earnings outlook in coming quarters, and some analysts said they expect a further drop in technology stocks. Stock in 3Com, based in Santa Clara, Calif., fell $13.50 to $37.25 in Nasdaq trading of more than 36 million shares, making the stock the most active in U.S. markets. ""This goes beyond just the third quarter for 3Com,"" said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at brokerage Furman Selz. ""I think it's going to spread from here,"" said David Takata, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co. ""The networking sector has been the leader in technology for three years."" 3Com said for the quarter ending Feb. 28 it will report earnings per share in a range from the mid-40s to low 50 cents a share. Wall Street expected 3Com to earn 60 cents per share, according to a recent survey by First Call, which tracks analyst estimates. A year earlier, 3Com earned 42 cents a share, or $74.6 million. 3Com said third-quarter revenues will reach $770 million to $810 million, missing analyst forecasts by at least $20 million. 3Com makes electronic devices that shuffle information between PCs operating in a network. The company gets about 43 percent of its revenue from ethernet adapter cards: graham cracker-sized devices that plug into PCs to link them with networks. Last week, Intel, the world's biggest maker of PC components, cut prices of its line of fast ethernet cards sharply. The reduction forced 3Com to announce its own sharp price cuts Monday, fuelling concern about the company's revenue in coming quarters. ""Intel rocked 3Com off its solid foundation,"" said Carl Howe, senior analyst at market researcher Forrester Research Inc. ""They hit 3Com's cash cow."" In the next few years, Intel potentially could incorporate networking functions into its computer chips, eliminating the need for seperate networking products, analysts said. Meanwhile, Intel will use its huge manufacturing facilities and its cost benefit to undercut 3Com in ethernet prices, analysts said. Pyykkonen said Intel could elbow aside networking suppliers, just as it knocked down suppliers of sound and video components by making multimedia functions a built-in feature of its microprocessors. ""There's no reason why networking can't go the way of PCs,"" Pyykkonen said. 3Com's shortfall projection prompted several Wall Street analysts to slash their ratings on 3Com stock to hold or neutral. ""The tone of 3Com's business remains weak,"" said William Rabin, analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., who cut 3Com to ""market performer"" from ""buy."" 3Com's earnings forecast also raised concerns about the entire networking industry, whose revenue has been growing about 35 percent annually. 3Com's woes are a sign that industry growth is finally slowing. ""Everyone is not only more on edge about 3Com's numbers but also whether they need to change the revenue picture in the longer term."" The drop in 3Com prompted declines in stocks in other network stocks, as well as makers of personal computers, computer chips and software. Another major network equipment company, Cisco Systems Inc. saw its stock drop $5.125 to $58 on Nasdaq. Ascend Communications Inc., another closely watched networking stock, fell $4.625 to $62.625, also on Nasdaq. Bay Networks Inc. fell 87.5 cents to $18.625, and Cabletron Systems Inc. fell $1.875 to $29, both on the New York Stock Exchange. Intel also dropped, losing $4.75 to $151.625 on Nasdaq.

"Silicon Graphics Inc. said it will launch a new line of computer workstations Monday as the company moves to fend off the threat of increasingly high-powered personal computers. The new line of Octane workstations fills out the broadest revamp ever of Silicon Graphics' product line. It includes a powerful new design aimed at bolstering its No. 3 position in the market for workstations running the Unix operating system. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company discussed its new products in interviews ahead of Monday's formal release. Silicon Graphics will also shave the prices of its Indigo2 Impact 10000 workstations by up to 22 percent as it aims to position the line between its entry-level O2 machines, introduced in October, and the new Octane models. The powerful machines are typically used by engineers in intensive number-crunching tasks ranging from oil exploration and molecular modeling to flight simulation, computer-aided design and video and television. The new Octanes share many of their components with the company's new supercomputing design unveiled in October and feature technology that greatly increases the speed with which data moves between its components. ""What SGI has done is eliminate most of the chokepoints, and you get the full effects of most of the microprocessor"" that is the heart of the computer, said David Weisberg, publisher of the newsletter Engineering Automation Report in Englewood, Colo. Weisberg and industry analysts said such performance was important to Silicon Graphics' effort to fend off the threat to its traditional high-end graphics markets by increasingly powerful PCs built with Intel Corp. microprocessors running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system. Shipments of the computers based on what analysts have dubbed the ""Wintel"" PC architecture surpassed traditional workstations for the first time in 1996, according to preliminary data from International Data Corp. The market research firm said Wintel-based systems grew 38 percent worldwide to 831,000 units. With revenues rising 16 percent to $3.7 billion while sales of traditional Unix workstations declined, International Data said it expects Windows NT-based systems to continue gaining share in 1997. Weisberg said he was concerned that Silicon Graphics, along with Sun Microsystems Inc., has chosen to shun Windows NT and adapt a Unix-only approach despite the fact many newer software developers favor Windows NT. ""Silicon Graphics is, in effect, eliminating some of the very good software vendors,"" he said. ""If they don't make some type of a move to support Windows NT by the end of the year, 1998 could be a very difficult year for Silicon Graphics."" Drew Henry, product line manager of Silicon Graphics' power desktop line, said that with the design used in its O2, Indigo2 and Octane systems, Silicon Graphics can ""sell levels of performance that are well above levels of performance that you're going to get out of a Wintel system."" About half of the new Octanes, which Silicon Graphics plans to start shipping by the beginning of March, are expected to be sold through third parties, he said. International Data analyst Karen Seymour said the Octane's new design, or architecture, would give it ""headroom"" for future high-end performance and help it gain market share. But she said it was not likely to challenge the position of first-place Sun Microsystems and No. 2 Hewlett-Packard Co.. ""I think the most critical aspect of this announcement is going to be SGI's ability to execute,"" she said. Silicon Graphics last week said delays in stepping up production of new computer models hurt financial performance in its December quarter despite strong demand for new products which pushed its orders to record levels. Pricing for the Octane systems starts at $24,995, the company said. The new prices for Indigo2 machines, which take effect Feb. 1 and include up to a 33 percent reduction in memory and storage upgrade prices, reduce the price of its lower-end Indigo2 Solid Impact to $19,995 from $24.995.

"Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd reported on Wednesday a 50 percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half and said it expected to make the appointment of its new chief executive officer (CEO) soon. David Jones, which is currently without a chief following the resignation of Chris Tideman on Monday, reported a net profit of A$22.34 million in the 26 weeks ended January 25, compared with a net profit of A$44.64 million a year ago. The retailer also said the 1996/97 year net profit would be lower than the previous year.   Chairman Richard Warburton said the retailer would also review five or six of its underperperforming stores, but would not say if that meant store closures, but added that David Jones was also committed to its store expansion programme. Tideman, who joined the company in 1994, made a surprise resignation on Monday, citing personal reasons. Responding to reports that there was shareholder pressure on Tideman to resign, Warburton said Tideman left of his own will and that there was no pressure from the board or shareholders.   Tideman oversaw the refloat of David Jones in November 1995 from the corporate remains of the debt-laden Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd, which cash-starved David Jones for most of the latter part of its 15-year ownership tenure. ""We expect to make an annoucement within days, not weeks,"" Warburton said about the chief executive appointment. Warburton said the half year results were helped by a good January, but described the result as ""disappointing."" ""February saw a bit of a correction from the January upturn, but we have seen a slight increase in March,"" Warburton said.   ""Over the balance of the year, the company will continue to focus on implementing initiatives in product, consumer service and systems,"" the company said in the results statement. ""However, at this stage it is anticipated that the profit before tax level in the second half will be below the same period last year,"" the company said. David Jones warned in early January that its first half profit would be up to 50 percent below forecast due to a lacklustre retail trading environment.   Warburton said today the company did not expect any material improvement in retail trading conditions in the second half, adding that three reductions in official interest rates in 1996 had yet to filter through to the retailing sector. Finance director Robert Wright said today David Jones' 1996/97 profit would be within analysts forecasts of between A$32 million and A$37 million. David Jones sales fell one percent to A$782.58 million in the 1996/97 first half.   Warburton said the retailer would review about five or six of its 30 stores department stores which were underperforming and not returing any shareholder vale. He said about one-third of David Jones stores were performing very well, another third were making a profit, but could be improved, while the final third were underperforming and not returning any shareholder value. ""You have got a final third that's just not producing shareholder value. They are not necessarily losing money but they are not increasing shareholder value,"" he said.   ""Out of that third a half, I believe, with a bit of hard work and creative juices could take them above the line, the other half we have to look at very, very closely."" ""So you can see we have about five or six stores to look at, that does not necessarily mean closure. It may mean you have to look at different things to do with those stores,"" he said. At 2.50 p.m. (0350 GMT), David Jones shares were two cents lower at A$1.72 with 487,292 shares traded. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","KevinMorrison"
"PolyGram, one of the big five powers in the world music industry, on Wednesday reported lower 1996 earnings but said it believed sales growth in the sector was set to recover strongly after stalling last year. ""We do not believe the music business to be a mature industry,"" PolyGram president and chief executive officer Alain Levy told a news conference, adding that he believed sales could grow at an annual rate of more than five percent. Levy said the $40 billion global music market had reached a plateau in 1996, when it grew by only three percent after several years of double-figure increases. But he said that he felt the problem was a shortage of good record releases rather than the end of a business cycle. ""I think the issue is an issue of creativity. The music makes the market,"" he said. PolyGram has a strong-looking release schedule for 1997, with albums planned by U2, Elton John and Van Morrison. PolyGram, Bertelsmann, Sony Music, EMI and Warner dominate the global music business, accounting for more than two-thirds of sales. Levy was speaking after PolyGram announced an almost 18 percent decline in earnings following a restructuring carried out in response to the slowdown in music sales. The music and film company's 1996 net income after tax and extraordinary items fell to 608 million guilders ($327 million) from 741 million in 1995. It took a post-tax charge of 114 million guilders as it reorganised its music operations. Its dividend was held at 0.95 guilders per share. Levy said PolyGram expected to resume earnings growth in 1997 but would not specify by how much. The results topped market forecasts and PolyGram shares surged 6.50 guilders to 89.80 on the Amsterdam bourse. As part of the restructuring, the company said it was cutting around 550 jobs, an increase on the forecast of 400 job losses made when the move was announced last October. Chief financial officer Jan Cook said the restructuring would pay off in two or three years, the staff cuts trimming the annual wage bill by some 50 million guilders. PolyGram is revamping its Motown unit, moving the famous soul music label's headquarters from Los Angeles to New York as it seeks to recreate its heyday of the 1960s and early 1970s. It is reorganising its European music distribution and marketing and restructuring its classical music division. PolyGram music increased sales by five percent to 7.95 billion guilders but operating profit fell three percent to 1.11 billion as margins came under pressure in a hard retail climate. The PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (PFE) unit, set up just five years ago, crept into a two million guilder operating profit in the second half of last year. Full-year operating losses fell to 35 million guilders from 68 million in 1995. But Levy said the unit would not make a profit in 1997 because of the costs of setting up a distribution operation in the United States and a move to bigger budget films. PFE has won 14 Oscar nominations this year for films such as Fargo, The Portrait of a Lady, Sleepers and Trainspotting. PolyGram is listed in Amsterdam and New York, with many of its senior executives based in London. Dutch electronics giant Philips Electronics NV owns a 75 percent stake in the firm.

"McDonald's Corp. just turned up the heat in the fast-food business. If franchisees go along with the plan, the world's largest restaurant chain will launch its biggest nationwide promotion ever, featuring 55-cent sandwiches, down from about $1.95 for a Big Mac, according to franchisee sources. The plan is a bold stept to lure customers into McDonald's restaurants in the face of intense competition in the nation's giant fast-food industry. McDonald's, which has more than 20,000 units worldwide and more than 12,000 in the United States, declined to give specifics on its plan. Spokesman Jack Daly said the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company hopes to launch a ""national value-price promotion."" Pointing to a current promotion on Chicken McNugget sandwiches, which analysts said has helped McDonald's build sales this month, Daly said, ""It's in that same spirit."" Charles Gonzales, a McDonald's franchisee with two units in the San Francisco area, said the nationwide promotion would feature a different sandwich for 55 cents each month when a customer buys french fries and a drink at the regular price. The promotion, he added, is expected to start with the Big Mac hamburger, which is usually priced between $1.90 and $1.99, and will include breakfast sandwiches as well, he said. But the promotion, to be presented to franchisees on Thursday, could spark a price war, analysts said. That prospect worried investors who drove fast-food stocks sharply lower. ""Everyone will have something for 55 cents. Now it's a zero-sum game again,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok. But Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said Wendy's International Inc. and Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, may not match McDonald's price promotions right away. ""There are a lot of things (companies can do) to enhance value without directly cutting prices,"" Adelman said, including increasing the frequency of regular promotions. Earlier, Burger King said it had no plans to change its prices. Wendy's officials were not immediately available. McDonald's stock tumbled $2.625 to $44.625 and Wendy's slid $1.50 to $20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares were among the most active issues. American shares of Britain's Grand Metropolitan Plc, which owns Burger King, fell $1 to $30.625, also on the NYSE. Dean Witter's Adelman said it remained to be seen if the McDonald's plan will bring in more customers. ""We have much more jaded consumers today,"" he said, noting price cuts were not ""new news."" Gonzales noted some franchisees oppose price promotions since they often do not boost customer traffic enough to offset lower sandwich prices. Moreover, regular customers may be tempted to order whatever sandwich is being offered that month instead of higher-priced menu items, he said. Daly, however, said increased sales volume is expected to offset lower menu prices. ""Margins (are) a function of volume,"" he added. Dick Adams, chairman of the Consortium, an independent association of McDonald's franchisees, said he expected the promotion plan to be approved. ""They (franchisees) are going to vote for it,"" Adams said. ""They are being told that it's the only plan that is available."" He said McDonald's was expected to present the plan in a satellite broadcast to operators across the country on Thursday. McDonald's has been looking to boost domestic sales, which have been pressured because of competition. In a December 1996 memo to owners and operators, Jack Greenberg, chairman of McDonald's U.S.A. said, ""We must re-energise and focus our U.S. marketing efforts and develop a national value proposition.""

"Intel Corp. said Friday its Pentium Pro and new Pentium II chips have a flaw that can cause computers to sometimes make mistakes but said the problems could be fixed easily with rewritten software. The company will not need to recall the chips, Intel officials said. The flaw was officially dubbed the ""Flag Erratum"" by Intel, the world's biggest chip maker. ""Basically, an erratum is a design defect that may cause the product to deviate from published specifications,"" Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop said. ""All microprocessors have flaws in them."" Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has been investigating the flaw since it was uncovered by an independent analyst last week. The discovery caused concern among investors and customers because it came just four days before Intel launched the Pentium II, its biggest new product in years. Some investors feared the flaw could force Intel to replace tens of thousands of chips, as it did in 1994 due to a defect in the original Pentium chip. International Business Machines Corp. said the flaw should not have any major impact on its PC customers. ""We currently have no information to believe that this reported anomaly will have a major impact on our customers,"" said a spokesman for the IBM PC Co. ""We are continuing to ship product,"" a spokesman for Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. said. ""Every processor has some kind of errata. This is obviously one that Intel is working on. It's not a show stopper."" The Flag Erratum occurs when some programs try to convert so-called floating point numbers, or decimal numbers, into integers. In some cases, the chip makes rounding errors, and it does not raise a warning flag that it made the error. Waldrop said Intel would not judge how serious the flaw was, leaving that to computer makers and software developers. But Intel will help developers rewrite programs to compensate for the error when it does come up. The Pentium Pro, a chip Intel began selling in November 1995, also has the defect. At first glance, the flaw does not appear to be too serious because it had gone undetected in the Pentium Pro for 18 months, said Rick Doherty, a director at Envisioneering Group Inc., a market researcher company. ""We've got a year-and-half of work on this puppy and no one has reported a single problem with their applications yet,"" Doherty said. ""But it's not over yet,"" he said. ""This means that an IBM and a Microsoft will have to go through their software packages to see if things are affected by it."" Waldrop said Intel will fix the defect in the new chips it makes. Investors apparently were not concerned about the flaw, as Intel rose 75 cents to $159.50 on Nasdaq. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL) is busy handling one of its most difficult and dangerous cargoes - live snakes, HACTL's general operations manager, Tony Morris said. As Hong Kong temperatures dip, up to five tons of mainly cobras and pit vipers are daily arriving by air to become snake soup, snake stew and snake wine. Rows of wire baskets outside restaurants are full of snakes awaiting their fate. The Chinese swear by the medicinal qualities of snake gall bladder cut out of a live snake and swigged down with a glass of brandy to ward off winter flu as well as other snake delicacies, Morris told Reuters in an interview. But the snakes pose a particular handling problem for the Hong Kong authorities as they are sometimes used to smuggle drugs, Morris explained. A popular method of smuggling heroin is to drug the snake with smoke, make a small cut in its skin and sew the heroin inside. All snake imports from breeding farms in Thailand and mainland China are scrutinised by hand in two specially equipped inspection rooms at HACTL. The brown hessian sacks packed in wooden crates with breathing holes are dumped into a big wire basket from which each snake is pulled to be carefully examined for hidden contraband. ""It wouldn't be everyone's favourite occupation but the customs officers treat it as an everyday job and actually seem to enjoy it,"" Morris said. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"The Czech December trade deficit should rise to 16 billion crowns ($575 million) from 14.3 billion in the last month of 1995, ending the worst Czech trading year on another sour note, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Friday. Czech 1996 trade figures are to be released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Monday. Most economists surveyed said they expected steady growth in the deficit but few surprises. ""I expect that the figures will be in line with the development throughout 1996,"" Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance, told Reuters. Whatever the December deficit, the full-year trade gap is guaranteed to be a record given that the January-November figure reached 140.1 billion crowns, already far beyond 1995's record total shortfall of 95.7 billion crowns. Most analysts agreed a 15-17 billion crown December gap, after a 16.6 billion crown shortfall in November, would match prevailing trends and the consensus forecast of a 1996 deficit of 155-165 billion crowns. The foreign exchange and money markets are expected to show little reaction to the figures -- the worsening Czech trade balance has been long built into crown rates -- as long as the results do not vary greatly from the estimates. Analysts say the trade balance has been hurt by a downturn in western European economies. Effects of a recovery in demand have yet to help Czech exports. CSU figures consistently show the rate of import growth exceeding export growth, although the gap has narrowed in recent months. Czech exporters told the CSU in a survey released earlier this month that, among other suggestions, they would want a 20 to 25 percent devalution of the crown against a mark/dollar basket to help boost lagging exports in 1997. The exporters said that if there were no devaluation of the strong Czech currency, then they expected the government to adopt administrative measures such as higher tariffs and surcharges to regulate imports. The government and central bank, however, have repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to boost exports. Analysts point to mid-1997 as a crucial time in which the import wave -- which is aimed at modernising industries -- must show results in productivity growth and competitiveness. ""There are concerns of the effect this has on the current account deficit,"" said one London-based economist. ""There is a question of the sustainability of the current account deficit. If you have a significantly higher (trade) figure than 15 or 16 billion crowns for December, I think people will get a little bit edgy,"" he added. The current account ran a deficit of $3.1 billion for the first three quarters of the year, in the latest available figures, spurred by the spiralling trade deficit which stood at the time at $4.1 billion. Economists have said the current account deficit for 1996, forecast at roughly seven percent of gross domestic product, could be financed in the short to medium term through the capital account surplus and strong central bank reserves. However, the deficit might start putting pressure on reserves in the second half of 1997. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=27.84 Czech Crown) ","AlanCrosby"
"Toronto stocks closed weaker on Wednesday, hit by the wave of selling after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan questioned whether equity prices could sustain their strong two-year growth spurt. ""It's bearish for stocks,"" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index recouped some of its early losses, but still closed down 46.35 points at 6201.43. Greenspan also expressed concern about the risks of inflation and warned the Fed may need to hike interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank about 120 points during the session, but finished the day off 55.03 points at 6983.18. Greenspan sparked a similar sell off in December after he remarked on the ""irrational exuberance"" of the stock market, but North American markets later recovered. ""We're going to continue to get this kind of sell off and bargain hunting,"" Beattie said. Wednesday's trading was brisk at 104.9 million shares worth C$1.88 billion ($1.37 billion).

"BAB Holdings Inc, which is still digesting its $29 million acquisition of Chesapeake Bagel Bakery, said it expects to buy more independent chains to expand its national presence as bagels grow in popularity. ""We probably get a call a week from independent bagel companies looking to be acquired,"" said Michael Evans, president of BAB, which operates Big Apple Bagels. He added that while BAB is open to acquisitions, the focus in the near-term is integrating Chesapeake, which the company agreed to acquire earlier this year.   Going forward, BAB will operate stores under the Big Apple Bagels and Chesapeake names, he added. The opportunity to expand reflects the growing popularity of bagels, which have become a staple for many Americans as a substitute for bread, Evans said. Evans reiterated that BAB, which will have 285 units after it completes its Chesapeake acquisition, hopes to have 800 units at the end of five years. ""If you take all the national chains, we have maybe 1,000 to 1,100 units. We're a long way from market saturation,"" Evans added in an interview.   Analyst Ernest Andberg of R.J. Steichen &amp; Co said bagel restaurants are in their infancy in terms of growth potential. ""There is significant room to grow chains now,"" he said. R.J. Steichen, which was the underwriter for BAB when it went public in November 1995, rates the stock a buy. Also adding units are Quality Dining Inc's Bruegger's Corp, the largest U.S. bagel chain, Einstein/Noah Bagel Corp, and Manhattan Bagel Co Inc, Andberg said. He added he believes BAB is well positioned to expand particularly in smaller markets in part because its units require a relatively modest capital investment.   Andberg added that BAB, which is headquartered in Chicago, makes its bagels from scratch on premise, which eliminates distribution concerns to serve smaller markets. Evans said BAB, which has both franchised units and a growing number of company-owned stores, sees a ""huge potential"" in secondary markets. He added BAB would locate in a smaller city if it could draw from a surrounding population base of 25,000 to 35,000 people. Evans said BAB also hopes to expand its Brewster's Coffee Co, which it acquired recently, including units in smaller towns. Evans declined to give earnings and sales growth targets for BAB, which had a net loss in fiscal 1995 of $0.19 a share due to expansion costs. Earlier this month, BAB said it expects fiscal 1996 revenues, excluding the Chesapeake acquisition, to more than triple 1995 revenues of $2.0 million.

"One of the most enduring bastions of the British empire in the Far East will fade into memory on Friday when Britain closes its last Hong Kong naval base, HMS Tamar. The closure of the naval base, on Stonecutters Island, comes ahead of the July 1 handover, when Britain returns Hong Kong, its colony of more than 150 years, to China. From July 1, the island will house the Chinese garrison. In a precursor to Friday's event, the Royal Navy on Thursday launched a new book marking its history in the colonial outpost of Hong Kong since 1840. Major-General Bryan Dutton, commander of the British Forces in Hong Kong, told Reuters the closure of Tamar would be a sad ending to a long historical era. ""Well, I'm very sad to see HMS Tamar close but it's a fact of life, it's going to be a fact of history,"" said Dutton. ""We are proud of the part the navy and the forces at large have played in Hong Kong over the last 157 years,"" he said. ""The important thing is that we do it well, we do it with some style. We will go out with our heads held high,"" he said. HMS Tamar is home to three patrol craft - HMS Plover, Peacock and Starling - the last remaining ships of the Hong Kong Squadron as the garrison winds down ahead of the handover. Accompanied by music from the Band of the Royal Marines, over 200 marines from the Royal Navy will parade in front of the quarter deck as the White Ensign is lowered for the last time. As the British army prepares to leave, Sino-British representatives handling details of Hong Kong's handover are finalising details of an advance party of Chinese troops to be stationed in the territory before the handover. Dutton said an agreement on the advance party was near. ""I'm hopeful there will be a sensible outcome in the near future, I think they're probably getting near an agreement."" It will not only be the British who will be affected by the closure of the Tamar base. Lo Ying, 74, who has worked with the Royal Navy in Hong Kong as a cleaner for more than 50 years, will also be retiring. ""We will be retiring, the gweilos are going back,"" she said. ""Gweilo"" is a Chinese nickname for foreigners, translated as ""foreign devils"". ","TanEeLyn"
"Apple Computer Inc. said Tuesday it plans to release an operating system that will work on personal computers based on chips from Intel Corp. as well as on Apple computers. At its annual developer conference, the company also said it will release programming tools in the next few months that will allow companies to write software for Apple computers once and automatically convert their products to run on PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software. The radical strategy is part of Apple's plan to keep software companies from abandoning Apple products, Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio told a crowd of 1,900 programmers here. ""For those of you who seek substantial business on both the Mac and Windows platforms, this new development environment holds tremendous promise,"" Amelio said. ""You can (write your applications once) and with a simple recompilation release them for both platforms."" Until now, Apple has released operating system software that runs only on Apple-designed hardware. Amelio said Apple's next-generation operating system, code-named Rhapsody, will run on Apple-designed computers, and on PCs based on Intel chips. ""It's a really good idea if they can deliver,"" said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, analyst at market researcher International Data Corp. By entering the PC market, Apple will have a great opportunity to show the world that its technology is special, Zwetchkenbaum said. For the past two years, Apple has been scrambling to come up with improvements to the Macintosh that would set it apart from PCs. Until 1995, Apple had relied on its computers' famed ease-of-use as a selling point, but Microsoft's release of Windows 95 took away much of the impact of Apple's pitch. Last year, Apple gave up on a mired effort to revamp the Macintosh Operating System, the fundamental programme that gives the Mac its look. In December, the company bought Next Software Inc. to get its software overhaul going again, and to use Next software as the foundation of a next-generation operating system. The move concerned lots of programmers, though, because of fears that the new operating system would not run the products they designed for the older Mac operating system. Programmers also were not thrilled to develop products for yet another operating system. Apple plans to spend the rest of this week convincing programmers that it is a worthwhile investment to write software for Rhapsody from now on. Programmes written specifically for Rhapsody can easily be converted to run on old Macs, as well as a new class of Apple machines using the Rhapsody operating system, and PCs running the Windows operating system, Amelio promised. Until now, Mac programmers who wanted to write a version of their product for Intel machines had to make huge changes to their programmes. The first versions of Rhapsody will be delivered later this year, Amelio said. Still, Apple faces a big challenge moving Mac developers to Rhapsody, Zwetchenbaum said. Switching to a new operating system involves learning lots of technical details. Apple's stock closed unchanged at $17.56 on Nasdaq. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Negotiators from China and the United States resumed last-ditch talks on Saturday to hammer out a new textile accord and a deal on market access after extending for a day the deadline for a cross-Pacific trade war. Chief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said she was confident of an agreement on Saturday in a fifth day of talks with officials of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. ""We felt like we had made tremendous progress and we are looking to complete negotiations today,"" she told Reuters before leaving for the ministry. ""You're always positive you can reach an agreement but you have to balance it out."" Hayes and Chinese officials wrangled late into Friday night to try to iron out problems in renewing a 1994 textile accord and to resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports. The United States had extended by a day the deadline for agreement on a new textile accord with China, Hayes said. ""I felt like it was important to extend it, the deadline, for one day... so we could get a fresh start this morning,"" Hayes said as she left for the eleventh-hour talks. ""We did not complete the agreement... so we felt like we'd have one extra day to complete it,"" she said. ""We didn't finish last night so we are re-evaluating where we are and will continue negotiations this morning."" She said the U.S. side was still focusing on two major demands -- its market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry. ""The two main things that we have been consistently concerned about are the market access that China has to the United States... and also making sure that it is balanced, that we have a market access package from China,"" she said. Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier. However, they said hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement. ""I expect the reason for the talks not wrapping up is market access,"" said National Retail Federation vice-president Robert P. Hall said on Friday. ""This is an issue that is not traditionally part of apparel bilaterals."" Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions. China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks. Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the previous deadline of January 31, Hayes has said. The United States would not give China another extension of the deadline, she said. Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries. ","ScottHillis"
"The prize in their hands, the question now is whether Ted Turner and Gerald Levin will feud or combine to exploit the golden opportunities being offered by the merger of Time Warner Inc. and Turner Broadcasting System. The companies, whose merger will create the world's largest media group, won approval on Thursday for their year-old deal from the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Communications Commission is expected to give its approval soon, and final approval by shareholders of both companies is scheduled for Oct. 10. While it is already known that Levin, the Time Warner chairman, and Turner, founder and head of Turner Broadcasting, will occupy the top spots at the new Time Warner, analysts wonder about their chemistry. The low-key Levin will be chairman and chief executive while the flamboyant Turner, who created Cable News Network and other major media properties, will be vice-chairman. ""The management side remains unclear, the division of duties remains unclear,"" said Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick. ""They have very different management styles,"" said analyst Dennis McAlpine of Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross. ""A lot depends on which Ted you get -- Ted the imaginative, creative and dynamic or Ted the meddler,"" he said. Both Turner and Levin have pledged to cooperate, but only time will tell if the two strong-willed managers will be able to co-exist at top of the huge company. In addition, the roles of second-tier executives at Turner Broadcasting have not been announced. Speculation about departures picked up when severance packages worth $29 million for eight Turner officials became public. Analysts said, however, the business fundamentals of the combination were strong. Together the companies will control top-tier programming and distribution systems for filmed entertainment and will have real strength with cable operators and advertisers both in the United States and elsewhere. Aside from being the nation's No. 2 cable-TV operator, Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. movie studios and Time, People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines. In addition to CNN, Turner Broadcasting also owns film and TV studios, a cartoon cable-TV channel and the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks sports teams. Turner has been assigned oversight of the combined company's cable-television programming, services such as The Cartoon Network and TNT. But whether or not Time Warner's own cable-programming service, Home Box Office, will be placed under Turner is still not known, McAlpine said. He also said it was unknown whether the film and TV production studios now owned by Turner Broadcasting -- Castle Rock and New Line Cinema -- would be report to Turner or be assigned to the executives running the highly successful Warner Brothers studio operations. There is also the possibility the two Turner studios could be sold. Krutick said she expected decisions on selling the Turner studios, including Castle Rock, which is being shopped around, to be taken up very quickly after the merger closes. ""If they can unwind an asset, one that's duplicative, and pay down debt, I think they will,"" said Krutick. ","MichaelConnor"
"Canada's French-language televised debate for the June 2 federal election was cut short suddenly on Tuesday when the moderator collapsed, leaving the five political party leaders stunned. Moderator Claire Lamarche, a well-known television personality in French-speaking Quebec, fell out of her chair moaning about the heat in the room, just as the five political party leaders were about to attack the defining election issue of national unity -- Quebec independence. ""We decided together that the debate should not continue under the circumstances,"" Arnold Amber, one of organizers of the debate, said in a hastily arranged news conference. ""All the parties are in agreement with this."" The party leaders left without speaking to the media. Canadians had been expecting a lively debate on how to handle the troubling issue of Quebec. But the moderator's collapse made the abbreviated exchange anti-climactic, said political scientist Ken McRoberts at York University in Toronto. ""There might have been some dramatic moments in the exchange over the response to a (pro-sovereignty vote),"" McRoberts said in a phone interview from Toronto. ""So (separatist Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles) Duceppe must be quite frustrated."" Duceppe, a francophone, was sidelined in the English debate on Monday night but observers expected him to use the French-language debate to rally the separatist forces and gather support for his waning campaign. The debate was about two hours into its scheduled 2-1/2 hours when the moderator collapsed, just as Prime Minister Jean Chretien was asked if he would recognize a vote in favor of Quebec sovereignty if it were by a slim margin. In 1995, people in French-speaking Quebec voted 50.6 percent against Quebec separation, while 49.4 percent voted in favor of separation, prompting federalist forces to claim victory. But instead of exploring how the next government would handle an expected referendum on sovereignty next year, the debate focused on Canada's high unemployment rate, robbing Duceppe of the chance to stir up much nationalist spirit.

"Rival bidders in the privatisation of French defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF will need to woo planes-to-missiles group Aerospatiale to stand a chance of winning the deal, analysts said. France is selling Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring which will affect state-owned Aerospatiale's business and the government has said it will ask Aerospatiale's chairman for his opinion about the offers. The government on Tuesday said it had ruled out Aerospatiale from bidding for Thomson-CSF either on its own or as part of a group because it is a public sector company already. A defence ministry official said on Thursday that if Aerospatiale, as a state-owned firm, had entered the bidding it would have meant ""the state upsetting the equitable handling of the privatisation procedure"". The government, through Aerospatiale, would have been throwing its weight behind one of the bidders, he said. Engineering group Alcatel Alsthom had enlisted Aerospatiale, and family-owned Dassault Industries, in its pitch for Thomson-CSF, to rival that of books-to-missiles group Lagardere. Because Aerospatiale has close ties with Thomson-CSF on a number of programmes, it would be directly affected by the sale and the government said it would consult Aerospatiale chairman Yves Michaud on offers for Thomson-CSF. Lagardere responded to the news by asking for a formal process to gain access to financial and industrial information on Aerospatiale to allow it to mount its bid for Thomson-CSF. But an analyst at a large French brokerage said relations between Lagardere and Aerospatiale were bad and the chances of Alcatel winning Thomson-CSF had improved. ""The chances of Lagardere (getting Thomson-CSF) are less today,"" he said. Aerospatiale and Lagardere compete directly in the same markets and products, notably in missiles and satellites. Lagardere has long considered it and not Aerospatiale should be the French centre for a European consolidation in missiles and satellites. Lagardere has tried to persuade Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA) to merge its missiles and satellites with its own joint ventures with British companies, instead linking up with Aerospatiale. Aerospatiale said it was ""pleased that the government, in its role of shareholder, will consult Aerospatiale's chairman on the parts of the offers for Thomson-CSF which will affect Aerospatiale."" Alcatel Alstom declined comment. Newspaper La Tribune reported earlier this month that Alcatel, Dassault Industries and Aerospatiale had agreed a plan to carve up Thomson-CSF's capital between them if Alcatel won the bidding. In that plan, Dassault would sell its holding in aircraft avionics firm Dassault Electronique to Thomson-CSF, and Thomson-CSF would sell its estimated four billion francs worth of missiles activities to Aerospatiale, boosting its presence in tactical missiles to better rival Lagardere's Matra/BAe Dynamics joint venture with British Aerospace Plc.

"Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp. raised the stakes Thursday in the bidding war for Conrail, amending their $8.5 billion merger agreement to provide Conrail shareholders with another $870 million. The new agreement would give Conrail shareholders another $16 per share, payable in CSX convertible preferred shares, as part of the stock portion of the cash and stock transaction. CSX and Conrail are battling with Norfolk Southern Corp., which has bid $10 billion, or $110 per share in cash, for Conrail. An industry analyst estimated the value of the new CSX-Conrail deal at $104 per share, or $9.5 billion. Norfolk Southern Corp. said after the amended deal was announced that it remained determined to acquire Conrail, was studying its options and would respond on Thursday or Friday. Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's offer, contending that a transaction with CSX is a better fit. Other aspects of the Conrail-CSX agreement are unchanged. They include $110 per share for 40 percent of the outstanding Conrail shares and 1.85619 shares of CSX common stock for each Conrail share. The proposed merger of Conrail and CSX, first announced on Oct. 15, would create a giant that would dominate the rail freight industry on the East Coast. In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Conrail shares traded at $100.375, up $1.375, and CSX traded at $44, down $1.25. Norfolk Southern traded at $86.375, down 12.5 cents, also on the NYSE. CSX and Conrail also established a voting trust to permit payment to Conrail shareholders by 1997. The companies said a Conrail shareholder meeting slated for Dec. 23 would be rescheduled for Jan. 17 and the CSX tender offer would be extended to Jan 22. The revised pact prohibits Conrail and CSX from entering into an agreement with a third party until Dec 31, 1998. The previous transaction set a July 1997 date. ""In every respect this merger holds great potential and clearly offers the best result for Conrail. This amendment to the merger agreement reaffirms the decision of the Conrail board that it is not willing to agree to the sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern,"" Conrail chairman David LeVan said in a statement. CSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in a cash tender offer at $110 per share and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent.

"CPC International Inc. said Wednesday it will spin off its corn refining operations to shareholders so it can concentrate on producing consumer foods like Hellmann's mayonnaise, Mazola corn oil and Skippy peanut butter. ""The fit of those businesses (corn refining and packaged foods) is not as good as it was,"" CPC Chairman C.R. Shoemate said in a telephone interview. ""Going forward they will be able to grow ... faster by focusing on the key drivers of each of those businesses."" The stock market applauded the move, sending CPC's shares up $2 to $84 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. ""I think it's a good strategic move,"" Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach said. CPC's corn refining operations yield high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; corn starch; dextrose, a food ingredient and sweetener, and traditional corn syrup. Although corn refining was profitable in 1996, that business was a drag on CPC's overall earnings due to dramatic swings in the corn market, the company said. CPC reported net income of $580 million last year, up from $539 million a year ago. After shedding the corn business, CPC will concentrate on its global packaged food, bakery and food service businesses, which analysts called among the best in the industry. ""I think that the company will finally come into its own in terms of recognition of the quality and growth potential that it has,"" Schroder Wertheim analyst Robert Cummins said. After the spin-off, CPC will be a global branded packaged food company with grocery products, baking and food service operations. Sales from these businesses amounted to $8.5 billion in 1996. CPC's branded grocery and foodservice businesses operate in 62 countries worldwide. CPC has a large and profitable packaged food business in North America, although 60 percent of its total packaged food business is in Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. The spun-off company will be the third-largest corn refiner worldwide with sales of $1.5 billion, excluding non-consolidated joint ventures. About two-thirds of the corn refining operations are in the United States and roughly one-third in Latin America, where it has about a 60 percent market share. In North America, CPC's corn refining business is the leading producer of dextrose and corn starch, Shoemate said. Corn refining joint ventures and technology agreements in Asia and Africa are small in terms of overall profits currently. ""But they are great starter positions for the longer term,"" Shoemate said. Shoemate said the spin-off is expected to be completed in about 10 months, pending approvals, including a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it will be tax-free to CPC and its shareholders. CPC, based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said it did not expect to assign any of its existing debt to the new company. However, it may launch an initial public offering of stock in the new company before distributing the new shares to existing shareholders, it said. Konrad Schlatter, currently senior vice president and chief financial officer of CPC International, will be chairman and chief executive of the new corn refining company. Samuel Scott will be president and chief operating officer of the new company and will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business. ","PatriciaCommins"
"Rational Software Corp., expanding its expertise in offering software programming products, said Monday it agreed to buy rival Pure Atria Corp. in a stock deal initially valued at about $839 million. Both companies' stocks plunged, however, after Pure Atria said its first-quarter earnings would be far less than Wall Street expected because of the difficulty the company has had managing its own recent acquisitions. Rational could have the same difficulties, analysts said. ""We're looking at a lot of questions about why the hell Rational would do this when they appeared to be winning the war with Pure Atria anyway,"" said Kris Tuttle, analyst at Soundview Financial Group. Rational Software's stock fell $9.75, or 42 percent, to close at $13.625, while Pure Atria's stock fell $7.75, or 44 percent, to $10 on the Nasdaq. Both were among the most active on Nasdaq and both were the biggest percentage losers in U.S. trading. Under terms of the acquisition, Rational would pay 0.9 of its shares for each of Pure Atria's 39.92 million shares outstanding. Based on Rational's Friday closing stock price of $23.375, the transaction would be worth $839 million. Monday's stock slide slashed the deal's value by 42 percent to about $489 million. Both companies write development tools, a type of software that helps programmers write other software. Rational, based in Santa Clara, Calif., specialises in methodology tools, which help programmers design the skeleton of complex software projects. Pure Atria specialises in development and testing tools, which let programmers write and test chunks of software code. The acquisition would give Rational all the components a big developer would need to write commercial-quality software, said Stan Dolberg, director of software strategies of market researcher Forrester Research Inc. But Rational is placing its bets on rigid, industrial-strength development tools at an awkward time. Rational and other development tool vendors face a fundamental threat from Java, a programming language that is all the rage among Internet and computer networking software developers, who do not need such rigid tools. ""My suspicion is that there are a lot of developers waiting to see what happens with Java,"" said Catlin Wolfard, analyst at brokerage Arcadia Investment Corp. in Portland, Ore. ""Every stock chart in the development market is down, down, down this year"" because of lower earnings prospects as big development tool purchases are put off. Rational also is buying a company that has had a hard time managing its own acquisitions, analysts said. Pure Atria's trouble could now be Rational's, Andrew Roskill, analyst at Smith Barney, told the brokerage's clients Monday. Pure Atria, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was formed last August when Atria Software Inc. bought Pure Software Inc. The companies still are struggling to meld their operations. Partly because of the difficult merger, Pure Atria said it expected first-quarter earnings to be between 2 cents to 4 cents a share, compared with 9 cents in the same quarter a year ago. Wall Street expected earnings of 12 cents, according to First Call, which tracks such estimates. Rational executives said they viewed this as the right time to buy Pure Atria. The acquisition will accelerate Rational's expansion into the testing market, said Jerry Rudisin, Rational's vice president of corporate marketing. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"A Royal Navy warship, bristling with weaponry, took up position on the Hong Kong waterfront on Monday to serve as a floating nerve centre for Britain's end-of-empire retreat in just 29 days time. Dodging flimsy sampans and commuter ferries chugging about the famously crowded harbour, the multi-role frigate HMS Chatham berthed beneath glassy skyscrapers alongside the Prince of Wales barracks in the heart of the metropolis. There it will tick away the hours, assuming the role of command centre for the British military withdrawal, until China takes back Hong Kong at the stroke of midnight on June 30. After the historic handover, the Chatham will escort the departing Royal Yacht Britannia, with Prince Charles and colonial governor Chris Patten on board, out of Hong Kong. Braving one of the hottest and steamiest days so far this summer, Captain Christopher Clayton said he and his crew looked forward to performing an historic task with pride. ""There is no sense of withdrawal,"" Clayton said. ""This is very much one professional armed forces handing over the protection and sovereignty of Hong Kong to another, the People's Liberation Army. So I look on it as a classic military evolution and one which we hope to do with some style, orderly and professionally."" The arrival of the type 22 frigate coincided with a 21-gun salute by the navy's HMS Plover patrol ship on the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation, which the Chatham honoured by ""dressing overall"" in a busy selection of flags and signals. With just 29 days to go, the frigate's arrival was the latest piece in the jigsaw puzzle of preparations for Britain's withdrawal from the pearl of its colonial possessions. The drawdown of the garrison, a highly visible expression of the end of British sovereignty, has already cut its strength to little more than 1,000 from 10,000 in the early 1990s. And while the British are leaving, the Chinese are arriving. The latest contingent of 90 PLA troops drove across the border on Friday, boosting an advance guard already in place to 206 unarmed soldiers, here to get garrison facilities ready. Offering them friendship, Clayton said the Chatham hoped to host PLA officers on board his ship. The frigate, designed to assume flagship duties, bristles with advanced weaponry including Harpoon anti-surface missiles and Sea Wolf missiles. She also carries Sea King helicopters. The Chatham is in the Asia-Pacific region as part of a larger 1997 task force deployment, codenamed Ocean Wave, involving a dozen vessels including the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and two nuclear submarines. ""This is not a regrettable occasion,"" said Robert Curry, a signal communications officer. ""It's an end of an era, certainly, but I don't think there should be any regret or shame at all."" The Chatham's nimble sailors in crisp, white suits shinnied up and down the ship's narrow galleys and stairwells, outlining all its guns in loving detail to bedraggled, thirsty visitors stumbling over unexpected nuts and bolts. ""As you can see, we are not a cruise ship. We are definitely a warship,"" said principal warfare officer Phil Haslam. ","SarahDavison"
"A German spoke on Wednesday of his kidnap ordeal in the jungles of Colombia and said he and his three companions, two of whom were killed, considered an escape on the day before the army stormed the guerrilla camp where they were held. Mardean Muzinic, a construction worker from Munich, and Manfred Kehrer, of Linz, Austria, were freed on Tuesday, a month after being seized by a 20-strong group of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels as they crossed into the country on foot from Panama via the remote Darien Gap. But Kehrer's brother Johann and friend Alexander Scheurer, also from Munich, were killed -- by guerrillas according to the military -- moments after army special forces attacked the insurgents' hilltop base in northwest Choco province. ""We talked about the choice of escape Monday but there were two different opinions,"" Muzinic told Reuters in a phone interview from a military base in Carepa, in Choco. ""I was for taking the risk because I thought only half of the guerrillas knew how to fight,"" he added. Like his companions, Muzinic received weapons training during military service at home and said he was convinced he would have been able to handle a rebel rifle. At least half the revolutionaries were less than 15 years old and had little idea of what they were doing, Muzinic said. But the four friends had been split into two groups after the 10th day of their ordeal -- making it almost impossible to time a joint escape attempt. They were only briefly reunited Monday to celebrate Manfred Kehrer's birthday. The guerrillas told them they were demanding a $15 million ransom. But German embassy officials and Austrian ambassador Franz Irbinger said they had no idea the men had been snatched until after they were released and had received no demands. ""I was sure the kidnap would last for months or years because we didn't have any money to pay for a ransom ... We were never sure they (the rebels) were telling us the truth. We know they told us a lot of bullshit,"" Muzinic said. The four backpackers, all between 25 and 30, finally opted to wait, fearing they could perish in the jungle if they made a dash for freedom through rebel-infested territory. ""The area around was full of guerrillas. The problem was where to run and which direction to take,"" Muzinic said. The four were abducted on Feb. 7 at the entrance to the Los Katios nature reserve, just a short distance from Colombia's border with Panama. Muzinic said they were forced to march about seven miles (10 km) a day along muddy jungle tracks on basic rations of rice and meat. At night a rebel leader known as ""Saul"" would read tracts of Marxist-Leninist literature to his comrades. ""It was not like a real kidnap. At times it was more like a guided tour. Some of the rebels were just playing with their weapons like in a cowboy movie. It was ridiculous,"" Muzinic said. But that sense of make-believe turned to tragic reality shortly after midday on Tuesday. Muzinic and Manfred Kehrer had gone under guard to bathe in a river near the rebel camp. The next thing they knew, the bullets started to fly and their captors fled. Minutes later a small group of army troops appeared further down the river. The firefight continued on the other side of the hill, however. In the hail of gunfire, Kehrer's brother and Scheurer died and four FARC fighters were also killed. Regional army chief Gen. Ivan Ramirez blamed the deaths of the two tourists on the FARC. Muzinic said he had not seen or spoken with the pair since the previous day but added: ""When the army came down from the hill they said the others had been shot by the rebels. I believe Saul gave the orders. He was a real fanatic ... a hardliner."" ","KarlPenhaul"
"China's flagship futures bourse, the Shanghai Metal Exchange, has ambitions to become Asia's premier metals trading floor, but economic realities are holding it back, the exchange's president said on Friday. Total turnover since the exchange opened in May 1992 has topped 180 billion yuan ($21 billion) and efforts at regulation have curbed speculation, Hu Yuezheng said in an interview. The exchange's 120 members include China's biggest base metals producers. All of them, along with the central government, now use the exchange's prices to monitor the market, Hu told Reuters. Measures introduced in 1994 and 1995 to reduce speculation on the exchange had cut turnover to 230 billion yuan last year, from 455.8 billion yuan in 1995, Hu said. But the introduction of several major regulations would see 1997 turnover expand on the 1996 figure, he said, but refused to make any projections. Although greater market regulation has boosted its credibility, the Shanghai Metal Exchange still remains a long way from a place on the world trading stage, Hu said. International metals trade is conducted in U.S. dollars, but China's yuan is not fully convertible, he said. Foreign investors are also not allowed to trade on China's futures exchanges. China has no securities law and the quality of Chinese product lagged far behind world standards, he added. But Hu said: ""It is of course my hope"" that Shanghai will become the East Asian equivalent to the London Metal Exchange (LME). Sipping tea from a Chicago Mercantile Exchange mug, Hu listed the market's current regulations, including margin requirements, limit up and limit down, daily clearance, and strict payment and delivery rules. Limit up and limit down rules, designed to minimise risk, covered three trading days, Hu said, after which traders suffering losses of more than six percent were required to enter their losses in the exchange computer so they could be offset against gains. ""On day one, the limit is three percent, on day two it is four percent and margin requirements are then increased from five (percent) to six percent,"" he said. ""If it is still limit up by day three, the limit increases to five percent and the margin requirement increases to eight percent,"" he said. Speculators would then be required to offset their positions, he said. And if there were no speculators, then hedgers would be required to do so. ""Why did we do it like this? Because over the past few years we have had many speculators here trying to squeeze the market and in this way we have brought some stability to the market, and our members feel their interests are protected,"" Hu said. Up to 20 percent of the exchange's total turnover was now generated by producer and consumer hedging, he said. While prices on the exchange are often move in tandem with those on the LME, Hu said Shanghai price levels increasingly reflected local fundamentals. ""At the moment there is no real relationship between the two exchanges,"" he said. ""China's rapid economic development has seen copper demand grow and now the country must import 30 percent of its needs, now around 1.1 million tonnes a year."" ""This need is what influences international prices,"" he said. ""There will always be contradictions between activity and regulation, but we feel it is more important to have a regulated market,"" he said. ($1=8.3 yuan) ","LynneO'Donnell"
"A plan on how the Czech Republic will diversify natural gas supplies, now coming solely from Russia, has been delayed for several weeks, the Industry and Trade Ministry said on Tuesday. ""We are gathering information, analysing it, and it's going to take several weeks (before a the issue is put before the government),"" ministry Spokesman Miroslav Konvalina told Reuters. A plan had been expected to be submitted to the government sometime in January. Konvalina gave no reason for the delay. Officials have declined to say which partners the government was considering, though government representatives have held talks on limited deliveries from Norway. The Ministry is drawing up plans for four options for securing gas supplies, but has given no details. No matter which plan is excepted, Russia is expected to remain the dominant supplier. The Ministry said the four options are being considered: * Purchasing all natural gas from Gazprom, using two different shipping routes, with a long-term agreement until 2016, with price guarantees until 1998. * Purchasing some Russian gas indirectly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and Germany's Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF. Gasunie would start supplies in 1998, delivering up to two billion cubic metres in 2005, with the agreement lasting until 2014. In case of a fall in Russian supplies, it would deliver its own gas through Wingas, a joint venture of Wintershall (65 percent) and Gazprom (35 percent). Wintershall offers a similar scheme, with deliveries starting on January 1 next year, rising to one billion cubic metres in 2000, under a deal until 2016. Negotiations with these firms are in the stage of initiating a supply contract. * Finalising and maintaining the agreement for Norwegian gas, which has already been preliminarily approved this year, until 2017. * A limited purchase from Mobil Europe Gas Inc, Germany's Brigitta Erdgas und Erdoel (BEB) and British Gas Plc. The Czechs have ended their dependance on Russian crude oil by building a new pipeline to Germany, but are still completely dependant on supplies provided by Russia's Gazprom. The Czech Republic consumes around eight to nine billion cubic metres of natural gas per year, but volumes are expected to rise to some 12-13 billion cubic metres by the turn of the century. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"China's major state banks reported profits last year -- some sharply higher than in 1995 -- and analysts said on Monday this showed they were beginning to act like commercial banks elsewhere. Fees from credit cards and electronic banking services were drawing in new income while loans were being extended with greater care in limiting risk, they said. However, the results probably disguised the banking system's huge pile of bad debts from past loans, and writeoffs -- either by the banks or the state itself -- were likely in the years ahead, they said. ""The big banks are gradually being turned into real commercial banks and making loans on a commercial basis,"" said an official at the Industrial and Commercial Bank in Shenzhen. ""There is a gradual reduction in (lending) risk,"" he said, adding that banks were also cutting costs through electronic payment systems and looking for new sources of income. That view was shared by other Chinese bankers. ""There are more controls on lending throughout the banking system,"" said an official with the Everbright Bank. China's banks once were viewed more as the financial arm of the government, extending loans to enterprises that needed funds regardless of whether they would ever repay. Banks are now encouraged to make loans that will return a profit while state development banks have been set up to help sectors seen as vital to government interests. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China -- the bank with the widest exposure in domestic industry -- said its profits surged to 14.5 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) last year from 4.6 billion yuan in 1995. The Bank of China earned 8.2 billion yuan and the China Construction Bank made 2.76 billion yuan, although neither gave comparative figures. The Agricultural Bank said it had a sharp rise in rise in profits in percentage terms. Bankers said the removal of an interest rate subsidy on long-term deposits and two interest rate cuts during the year fuelled bank profits. The rate cuts not only helped ailing state companies to repay loans that had already been extended but they widened the spread between the cost of funds and the interest earned on loans. ""The spread has widened to about three percentage points from less than one point,"" said Beijing University economist Xiao Zhuoji. ""This has also helped the state banks."" But foreign financial specialists said there was still a relatively low return on assets and one of the key concerns was the extent of the bad loans of the past. ""No one really knows the extent of the bad debts in the banking system,"" said a foreign financial specialist in Beijing. The U.S. based rating agency Moody's Investors Service said in a report at the weekend that the banks would be insolvent if their loan values were written down to reflect repayment problems, but resolution of the issue would require a complete restructuring of state industry and recapitalistion of the banks.

"Britain's commercial property market may be improving but it has not yet got a clean bill of health, a senior Bank of England official said on Wednesday. ""It would be rash to conclude that the market is now unambiguously healthy in all respects. There are still several factors which will continue to pose challenges to the investment, banking and valuing communities,"" said Pen Kent, executive director at the Bank of England. Kent said that while lease lengths had temporarily stabilised, clauses by which tenants could break leases were becoming more common and many would need less space. ""It is clear too that many occupiers will continue over the long-term to reduce their needs for space and to demand greater flexibility,"" Kent told the Investment Property Forum in a speech. A combination of factors were making it ""less straightforward to form a view of the quality of cashflow likely to stem from a particular building"", he added. There was a sizeable overhang of unlet secondary property. ""The pool of such property increases every time that a major user of space moves into new offices and releases its former premises,"" he said. Kent called for solutions to the problems of much secondary stock not being suitable for conversion to alternative uses or never being able to be relet. ""This will continue to exert a dampening influence on the market and imaginative solutions will be needed."" Kent also outlined his views on the future for the market. While institutional investors were attracted to the sector in the short-term ""they could easily resume their longer-term departure from property in a couple of years"", he said. This could occur if the property market's performance waned as the economic cycle progressed and other assets began to look Banks might also become disillusioned with property again ""particularly if they relax their lending criteria too far in the current exceptionally competitive lending market"". Kent also warned that while healthy competition between lenders was a good thing, ""history suggests that the seeds of tomorrow's losses are sown when lenders relax the basics such as loan to value ratios and income cover; or when they take very bullish views on the likely strength of cashflows"". The BoE had heard some lenders were seeking to pressurise valuers into higher valuations. ""This is not a healthy practice and we hope both the lenders and the valuing profession will be strong enough to resist,"" he said. On a more positive note, Kent said there had been welcome progress on the development of property derivatives and securitisation as well as improving the quality of market information. He said he supported suggestions that commercial transaction prices should be made public. ","AlexanderSmith"
"Britain and China signalled on Monday that they are set to discuss Beijing's late request to deploy more troops in Hong Kong before the territory reverts to Chinese rule at midnight this June 30. Top British and Chinese officials on the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a body handling details of Hong Kong's transfer, also said they were confident the matter would soon be resolved. Beijing's request to have more of its People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops positioned in Hong Kong before the handover emerged last week and was quickly surrounded in controversy. British officials were adamant there was no question of London agreeing to China's request as the British garrison alone remains responsible till the handover, barely two weeks away. But on Monday, a top British representative on the JLG said both sides would soon discuss the issue. ""The subject has been on our agenda to discuss and we're continuing to discuss it,"" Hugh Davies told reporters. Zhao Jihua, Davies' Chinese counterpart on the JLG, told reporters that Beijing thought it was necessary to have more troops deployed in Hong Kong before the handover. ""There is a practical need. It is a matter that needs to be resolved and we hope to solve it,"" Zhao said. China has said it needs a few hours before the midnight handover ceremony to deploy its main force. Beijing has already sent an advance party of 200 soldiers to prepare garrison, supply and communication facilities. Britain insisted they be unarmed and wear uniforms only in barracks. Many Hong Kong people are jittery about the arrival of the PLA as they remember the comunist army's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. But both Zhao and Davies gave no sign whether Britain would concede to China's latest request. ""We've made our position clear already,"" Davies said, but he added: ""I think the arrival of the PLA will take place as around July 1. We're not going to discuss what we're going to be talking about privately on the subject."" Beijing's request to send more troops and London's clear refusal last week threatened to deepen a rift over Hong Kong's sovereignty changeover. London, together with Washington, angered Beijing last week by saying they will boycott the swearing-in of a China-backed legislature during the midnight handover party to replace Hong Kong's current democratically-elected chamber. Beijing has vowed to disband the existing chamber, removing at a stroke democratic reforms introduced unilaterally by Britain inthe twilight years of its rule in Hong Kong. ","TanEeLyn"
"Air Canada is interested in opening up new Asian destinations including Tokyo and Singapore, said the airline's president and chief executive officer Lamar Durrett. In a speech to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, reputed by members to be the largest outside Canada, Durrett said the airline is looking forward to future competition with Asian carriers hopefully with the help of open skies agreements. He said the airline was positioning itself to become a long-term participant with a major expansion of services to customers across the Asia-Pacific region. ""The steadily increasing trade and travel links between Asia, Europe and North America are creating more opportunities for more carriers to offer passenger and cargo services. The Hong Kong-Canada market is a perfect example,"" Durrett said, pointing out that there had been a 41 percent increase in trans-Pacific capacity with the introduction of the airline's winter schedule. Speaking to reporters after his speech, Durrett said he would like to expand services into Japan -- Air Canada currently flies to Osaka in partnership with ANA -- and also to fly to Tokyo and other Asian destinations. ""I don't expect we will open up a new Asia city in 1997, although we never say never, but we are interested in Singapore, Indonesia and have a big interest in China.

"China's state-run steel companies must trim their bloated payrolls but they are nimble enough to survive in the fiercely competitive marketplace, top officials said on Monday. They also pledged that big steelmakers now preparing to float their shares -- like Anshan Steel and Chongqing Iron and Steel -- would not disappoint shareholders. ""We have confidence in the state enterprises in our industry,"" said Liu Qi, minister of Metallurgial Industry. ""They can adapt to market conditions."" Liu and other senior ministry officials told reporters that many companies in the sector had already begun trimming staff and the trend would continue in the years ahead. ""We have made a good start to restructuring,"" he said, adding that reforms would continue. Many of China's big state industries are grossly overstaffed and unable to compete with more efficient foreign competitors. Senior ministry officials said they wanted to see only about 800,000 workers producing steel by the turn of the century. The industry employs 4.5 million people now, but that includes many workers not directly engaged in production as well as those at associated companies. Liu said that Anshan Steel, one of three companies cleared late last year to list its shares abroad, had 190,000 employees but only 70,000 were producing steel. The others were at affiliated companies that were operating independently, he said. Liu cautioned, however, that many of them would not be out on the street as companies would try to find some form of work for them. ""Restructuring does not mean large numbers of people thrown out of work,"" he said. Liu said that while steelmakers tried to streamline their operations they were also incorporating new technology to help cut production costs. Other officials defended the track record of steel companies that have already offered shares, such as Hong Kong-listed Maanshan Iron and Steel, which has struggled with profits. ""Maanshan is a good company with excellent products and equipment,"" said vice minister Wang Wanbin. ""Maanshan has had problems but it will achieve better results in future,"" he said, adding that other steelmakers would also perform well in future. Other officials said that China's had 107 large and medium-sized steel making companies and that 70 percent of them made were profitable last year. They earned a net 5.1 billion yuan last year with gross profits of 7.4 billion yuan, partly offset by losses of 2.3 billion from those operating in the red. They added that nearly half of the smaller companies were losing money though and that economies of scale had to be raised. Panzhihua, a big steelmaker in Sichuan, is also planning to list shares abroad, while Benxi Steel and Hubei Daye Specialty Steel are among those planning offers for foreigners on the domestic B share market.

"Russia's energy sector will soon have fewer domestic players as newly-privatised oil companies eye domestic mergers and acquisitions to improve production and refining margins, industry sources said on Monday. Producers -- eager to cash in on higher refined oil products prices abroad and at home and to replenish books with cash for big-ticket production projects -- were beginning to eye downstream and upstream consolidation, analysts said. While it was early for formal mergers, they said Russian companies were beginning to lay the groundwork for acquisitions and a shakeout of the sector's dozen or so vertically-integrated companies and eight independent firms was inevitable after 1998. ""Undoubtedly we will see a winnowing,"" said Stephen O'Sullivan, director of oil and gas at MC Securities in London. ""There are too many oil companies and not all can survive."" Moscow has transformed its old Soviet production associations into vertically-integrated companies, but the process left most firms with major imbalances between production and refining. Russia is awash in refining overcapacity, which, at 6.8 million barrels per day, far outstrips current output of around 5.8 million bpd -- making refineries prime takeover candidates. ""Yes, I see consolidation,"" said Dan Lubash, managing director of Emerging Markets Europe at Merrill Lynch in London. ""Margins in a market in transition tend to move very quickly."" In one example of the slimming awaiting the world's third largest oil producer, Russia's LUKoil -- one of the world's largest oil companies by reserves -- said on Monday it would seek to acquire Norsi-Oil, an independent refiner with marketing units and no production facilities. ""This is not a hostile takeover, but rather two companies working together,"" said LUKoil spokesman Pyotr Neyev, adding LUKoil would seek a major equity stake in the plant. Analysts said producers were increasingly annoyed at seeing lower profits from refineries where they conducted tolling operations -- supplying crude oil for processing at plants they do not own and then taking it back for resale. In a second takeover battle, an industry source said oil major SIDANCO and mini-major Sibneft were tussling for Rosneft, the state oil holding firm which holds the government's stake in production-sharing deals and is slated for privatisation. Analysts said a third shakeout could see Sibneft making a play for the East Siberian Oil and Gas exploration company. ""Downstream in Russia, something has to happen,"" said a senior Western consultant. ""The money's not coming back to the producers, and something has to be consolidated."" But upstream consolidation is also inevitable, since the future of Russian oil is in hard-to-recover, remote, expensive reserves requiring a pooling of cash and technical expertise. ""If you're aiming at economies of scale in five years, you've got to start the (consolidation) process now, and that's what we're seeing"" said the Western consultant. One such deal tried and failed last year, when former Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik tried to create a giant oil corporation by merging four companies -- the Tyumen Oil Company, ONAKO, the Eastern Oil Company and Slavneft. ""The general feeling is that only those strong enough in terms of corporate structures and centralised cash flows will be looking to pick up assets in the upstream business,"" said a Russian energy analyst at a Western investment bank in Moscow. But analysts said mergers were already on many companies' agendas. ""There are two driving forces here,"" said O'Sullivan. ""A desire to move into downstream, and a drive by existing companies to consolidate their existing holdings fast."" -- Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520 ","LynnleyBrowning"
"Kellogg Co. Friday reported a profit for the fourth quarter, reversing a year-ago loss, but said the U.S. and British breakfast cereal markets remained difficult. The largest producer in the $9 billion U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, Kellogg's domestic cereal sales fell in the quarter, spokesman Richard Lovell said. He would not elaborate, though analysts said the drop was about 5 percent. Kellogg, whose brands include Kellogg's Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies, had a profit of $87.3 million or 42 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $71.6 million, or 33 cents a share in the 1996 quarter. The results included restructuring and other charges of $110.7 million in the latest quarter and $369 million in the 1995 quarter. Sales fell 6 percent to $1.56 billion from $1.66 billion. The restructuring is meant to save at least $160 million in savings this year and in future years, it said. Excluding charges and extraordinary costs, Kellogg's earnings amounted to 78 cents a share in the quarter, compared with 77 cents a share in the 1995 period, which was in line with Kellogg's own projections. Analysts said lower marketing expenditures helped the company hit its earnings target for the quarter. Because of that, ""the quality of earnings in the quarter was not good,"" said Robert Cummins, managing director of Schroder Wertheim. Lovell said marketing expenditures declined but would not say how much. Total selling and administrative expense fell nearly 15 percent to $540.7 million from $633.5 million. ""It seems like they're cutting off their nose to spite their face by cutting back marketing when sales volumes are declining,"" said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach. Lovell said spending on marketing was likely to rise this year from 1996 levels. Selling and administrative costs for 1996 dropped about 4 percent to $2.5 billion. Analysts said some of the increased promotional spending will go for new cereals that Kellogg expects to launch in 1997. The company introduced Kellogg's Honey Crunch Corn Flakes cereal in the United States in September, which garnered a strong a 1.3 percent market share, Kellogg's said. ""While the U.S. and U.K. remain challenging, we are encouraged by the contribution of new cereal products in both markets,"" Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement. Internationally, cereal sales volume rose, Lovell said, with analysts estimating the increase at 4 percent to 6 percent. Kellogg, which also makes Nutri-Grain snack bars, said convenience foods had a double-digit sales gain in the quarter. ""We look forward to the continued growth of this business, both in the U.S., where we have recently acquired Lender's Bagels, and through expansion to new international markets,"" Longbo added. Overall, global volume grew 2 percent in the quarter and 1 percent for all of 1996. Looking ahead, Kellogg repeated that it expected a low double-digit percentage increase in earnings for 1997, compared with 1996. The first quarter, however, is expected to be down from the $212.2 million, or 99 cents a share, earned in the first quarter of 1996. Kellogg's stock rose $1 to $69 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ","PatriciaCommins"
"The number of banks charging non-customers for using their automated teller machines doubled over the past six months, a consumer watchdog group said Tuesday. About 45 percent of ATMs added the controversial surcharge, on top of the fee most consumers already pay their own banks for using another bank's machine, up from 23 percent in October, according to a survey by U.S. Public Interest Research Group. The non-profit consumer advocacy group also found that the average fee had risen 20 percent to $1.15 from 96 cents. ""Banks aren't earning money the old-fashioned way. Instead, they're gouging consumers,"" Edmund Mierzwinski, programme director for the group, told a press conference. Two states, Connecticut and Iowa, have banned the practice of charging non-customers and 12 other states, along with the federal government, are considering similar legislation. Mierzwinski endorsed those efforts and said consumers should avoid using machines that impose a surcharge. The rise in fees followed a decision one year ago by the two largest ATM networks, Visa's Plus and Mastercard's Cirrus, to lift a prohibition on surcharges. Banks defended the practice and said the additional fees helped pay for ATMs in new locations. ""The marketplace should decide the prices for ATMs, not the government,"" the American Bankers Association said in a statement. ""Price controls will only inhibit innovation and put a halt to future ATM growth."" Banks added almost 17,000 new ATMs last year, a 13 percent increase, according to a survey by the publication Bank Network News. With surcharges now permitted, ""ATM growth is accelerating,"" editor Don Davis said. ""It's a better business to be in, so more people are getting in."" Big banks were more likely than smaller ones to impose a surcharge, according to the survey. Among the 300 largest banks, 53 percent of ATMs had a fee while only 40 percent of smaller bank ATMs and 6 percent of credit union ATMs charged a fee. That could raise antitrust law implications if large banks banded together to impose fees and drive smaller competitors out of business, Mierzwinski charged. ""Not only are big banks using their monopoly muscle to punish consumers with higer fees, but their strategy is to use the surcharge to hurt small banks and credit unions as well,"" he said. Customers of small banks, which have fewer of their own ATMs, would likely have to pay a surcharge more often. Banks say free-market competition is functioning properly. ""Competitions is already keeping ATM pricing in check,"" the ABA said. The consumer group said it surveyed 860 ATMs chosen at random in 27 states and the District of Columbia. The highest rates of surcharging were in the South, with 93 percent of Texas ATMs imposing a surcharge, 95 percent in Georgia, and 88 percent in Viginia and North Carolina, the group said.

"Newspaper, magazine and radio group Rural Press Ltd said on Thursday that it was not confident of the economic turnaround needed to increase its profit for the full year to June 30, 1997. ""My personal view is that we're some time away from some significant turnaround ... in the consumer markets and in real estate,"" managing director Brian McCarthy told Reuters. ""I can't see much improvement up to the middle of the year at the earliest,"" McCarthy said in an Interview.   Earlier Rural Press announced a four percent rise in net profit for the six months to December to A$16.96 million and set an unchanged dividend of four cents per share. But Rural Press also warned that trading in the first five weeks of the second half had been below last year and that it needed an improvement in the economy to continue its history of profit rises for the full year. McCarthy said earnings before interest and tax would have fallen marginally in the half year if they had been compared on a like-for-like basis before the effects of acquisitions.   McCarthy said the slight profit fall on a like-for-like basis was a reflection of weak real estate and retail sectors, which provide the bulk of Rural Press' advertising income. ""The retailing industry is very flat to the point of depressed. There's not a lot of activity in the real estate sectors and they are our key sources of revenue,"" he said. ""We think we're doing all of the things that have to be done internally, but it's a very hard external environment that we're looking at today,"" he added. ""In the framework in which we operate, we don't see it as a disappointing result.""   McCarthy said that given the tough economic outlook, there was not going to a major second half recovery in Rural Press' revenues. He said it was unlikely that Rural Press' final dividend would fall. However Rural Press, despite the operational pressure, remained keen to acquire new businesses, McCarthy said. ""We're still very, very keen to keep growing and acquiring,"" he said, adding that Rural Press had facilities in place to allow acquisitions worth up to A$50 million.   Rural Press' share price closed unchanged at A$4.10, despite the market's one percent rise overall to a record high. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","BernardHickey"
"Four regional Bell telephone companies reported strong fourth-quarter results Tuesday, riding a wave of demand for extra phone lines, wireless phones and ""smartphone"" services like caller ID. Two sets of merger partners -- Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. and SBC Communications Inc. and Pacific Telesis Group -- all produced results fairly close to analysts increasingly ambitious expectations. ""These companies have clearly raised the bar on expectations for demand growth. It should be sustainable for 1997,"" said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. The Bells have been powered by the mushrooming demand for phone lines to link home computers to the Internet, falling costs of mobile phone service, which has lured more users; and by technology to get more from a phone call -- call waiting, caller ID and call management systems. Even the companies are surprised by the market's power. ""I'm amazed by how much momentum we have. Frankly, its in advance of our business plans, and its due to both the healthy economy and an overall exploding telecom marketplace,"" SBC Chief Financial Officer Don Kiernan said in an interview. However, the Bells' stocks continue to be subdued, as investors worry about who will win when regional Bells and long-distance companies follow the lead of telecommunications deregulation and enter each others' markets later this year. Nynex Corp. said its net income rose 10 percent to $416.5 million, or 95 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $378.7 million, or 88 cents a share, in the 1995 period. Revenue edged up 0.9 percent to $3.33 billion from $3.30 billion, the New York-based company said. It was reduced by a change in accounting for directory revenues, the assessment of prior-period service rebates and Nynex's decision not to stimulate certain markets while it was in the process of improving services. Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. said its profits, depressed by one-time items, fell to $346 million, or 79 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $392 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion. Excluding onetime gains and losses, however, Bell Atlantic's operating income rose 7.3 percent to $424 million from $395 million. ""We posted strong gains in our key communications markets in 1996 as we prepare to complete our merger with Nynex in 1997,"" said Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond Smith. The two companies agreed to merge in April 1996, hoping to create a company with over $50 billion in market value. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of March. For the year, Bell Atlantic earned $1.88 billion, or $4.28 a share, on revenue of $13.1 billion. In 1995, it earned $1.86 billion, or $4.24 a share, on sales of $13.4 billion. ""Both Bell Atlantic and Nynex reported better-than-expected results compared to analysts' consensus,"" said Bill Vogel, analyst at brokers Dillon Reed. ""Bell Atlantic had a very strong and robust quarter. There were quite a few charges in the quarter, but fundamental volumes of the business are at or above expectations,"" he said. ""For NYNEX it was the first back-to-back years with double-digit earnings growth."" SBC Communications Inc., parent of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., said its net income rose 4.8 percent to $542.9 million, or 90 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $517.8 million, or 85 cents a share, in the year-ago period. ""Our outstanding financial performance was driven by excellent results by our wire line and wireless businesses, as strong demand and effective marketing led to the addition of a total of 1.5 million customer lines during the year,"" said Edward Whitacre Jr., chairman of the San Antonio, Texas-based company. Pacific Telesis reported profits of $191 million, or 45 cents a share, before one-time adjustments, down from $233 million, or 54 cents a share, last year. Excluding adjustments, net income rose to $282 million, or 66 cents a share. The parent of San Francisco-based Pacific Bell said its earnings before adjustments were driven by expanding business in data delivery and new custom calling services, as well as increases in access line and minutes-of-use volume. Nynex closed unchanged at $50.375, Bell Atlantic fell 25 cents to to $67, SBC fell 25 cents to $52.50, and Pacific Telesis rose 12.5 cents to $37.75, all on the New York Stock Exchange. ","NickLouth"
"North American garbage companies can be expected to continue picking over each others' assets as big firms sell off money-losers and small players consolidate, the top executives of the biggest haulers and handlers of waste said on Monday. At a conference held by the Raymond James brokerage and investment bank, a half dozen trash hauling companies made presentations to investors. In all the talks, asset strategy figured prominently.   In the top tier of the industry, the two biggest U.S. firms -- WMX Technologies Inc and Browning Ferris Industries Inc -- control about a quarter of the $35 billion solid waste market. Both WMX and BFI are fast shedding non-core and unprofitable operations as they reposition and rationalize after years of undisciplined acquisitions, analysts said. At the same time, Canadian giant Laidlaw Inc is transforming itself into a transportation company and leaving the solid waste market, as well as the $3.5 billion hazardous waste market, in which it had dominated in North America.   At the lower levels, fast-growing mid-sized companies -- such as USA Waste Services Inc, United Waste Systems Inc and Superior Services Inc -- are playing the consolidation game. By sifting through the giants' dross and snapping up deals from among dozens of small, private firms, the mid-cap players are growing rapidly. ""At the end of the day, you'll have an industry that has sorted through its asset base so that several companies will be better positioned,"" said Todd Holmes, vice president at Browing Ferris, based in Houston.   Trash hauling and handling turned into a hot business in North America in the 1970s with the rise of environmentalism and stricter government regulation of polluters. Riding a wave of rapid consolidation in a highly fragmented industry, innovators like WMX and BFI experienced explosive growth. In its first 20 years, industry leader WMX made 2,000 acquisitions. But the boom years ended in the 1990s with a levelling of environmental regulation, greater market concentration among companies and a surplus of supply in several key markets.   In addition, added Laidlaw chief executive James Bullock, ""The focus of solid waste handling is migrating away from landfill to recycling, which has lower (profit) margins and suffers from the vagaries of commodity prices."" For WMX and BFI, too, growth by acquisition hit an inevitable ceiling as the pool of affordable targets dried up. ""The consolidation strategy was unsustainable for us,"" said WMX chief financial officer John Sanford. Oak Brook, Ill.-based WMX reacted to these changes by diversifying in the 1990s into related businesses, but the strategy failed, leading to shareholder disappointment.   Laidlaw, based in Burlington, Ont., has separated itself from its solid and hazardous waste operations. It still owns sizable stakes in the successor companies -- Laidlaw Environmental Services and Allied Waste Industries Inc -- but expects to sell its interests, valued at a combined $1.2 billion. ""Over time, you will see us exit our investments in both of those,"" Bullock said in an interview with Reuters. At the next level down, growth by acquisition continues. The business has virtually no barriers to entry -- any outfit with a half-dozen garbage trucks can get a route and make itself a takeover target. As a result, Bullock said, ""The little guys are still playing the consolidation game...They can be successful at that for a while."" ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"A Hong Kong member of the Chinese committee handling the territory's return handed a letter to Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday protesting against Beijing's plan to dilute civil liberties laws. Frederick Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, handed the letter to Qian just before the start of a two-day plenary session of the 150-member Preparatory Committee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. ""I gave a document to him in the hope he will study it,"" Fung told reporters. ""I have a different view on the Preparatory Committee proposal to repeal several provisions of the Bill of Rights."" Beijing's plans to repeal or amend a list of 25 Hong Kong laws and ordinances, including parts of its Bill of Rights, will be debated at the session of the caucus responsible for shaping Hong Kong's future in the countdown to the handover this year. The announcement this month from Beijing, which said the laws contradicted Hong Kong's future mini-constitution the Basic Law, has sparked outrage in the British colony and forceful objections from London and its allies. ""I feel if it doesn't violate the Basic Law it should not be retracted,"" Fung told reporters. ""If the Preparatory Committee abolishes the provisions of the Bill of Rights it will create unnecessary worries and be detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997,"" Fung said in his letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Fung's protest followed an attack on Thursday by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten who lashed out at what he called China's repugnant proposal to dilute Hong Kong's civil liberties after it recovers the British colony at midnight on June 30. ""On the Bill of Rights, not only does it not contradict the Basic Law, but is necessary for implementing... the two regulations on adapting human rights conventions to Hong Kong,"" said the letter by Fung, who is also a member of the territory's Beijing-appointed provisional legislature. ""I believe the abolition of the above bill will bring instability to the rule of law in the future special region,"" he said. Fung's group advocates democracy for Hong Kong but through cooperation rather than confrontation with Beijing. Fung also voiced opposition to China's decision to repeal recent Hong Kong regulations formally allowing political parties, warning that Beijing's decision to return to the British colonial era system would affect Hong Kong stability as well as its credibility. ""I believe that to restore these provisions is totally against developing toward the casting off of colonialism and against the principle of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong,"" he said in the letter. Hong Kong's post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa, who is attending the crucial committee meeting in Beijing, argued in defence of Beijing's move that the international community had misconstrued the situation. U.S. President Bill Clinton has expressed concern. Britain summoned the Chinese ambassador in London order to lodge a protest and Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind plans to pursue the issue in a meeting with Qian next month. Qian has insisted the transition process is going well. ","ScottHillis"
"Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. will spend more than $500 million to revamp and expand its stand-alone tire and battery stores under the new National Tire and Battery name, the retailer said Wednesday. The change is part of a plan under which Sears will spend more than $1 billion through the year 2002 on its entire auto group, adding stores and converting some existing stores. Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears, which sold 25 million tires and 8.5 million batteries through its Sears Tire Group in 1996, will combine most of its 275 Tire America and National Tire Warehouse Stores under the National Tire and Battery name, Sears said. The company also plans to add about 100 National Tire stores a year over the next five years, and hopes to add about $120 million in annual tire group revenue when the expansion is completed. Sears tire group had $2.3 billion in revenues in 1996. The stores, unveiled Wednesday in Chicago, will have a high-tech, open feel, with customers able to watch the work being done on their cars. Pricing will be competitive in individual markets, Sears said. ""We will be at market pricing in every market we're in,"" Paul Baffico, president of Sears Automotive Group, said in an interview. ""We do not necessarily want to be the market price leader, but we will be competitive with anybody who is in the market."" The stores, which will be located away from shopping malls, are geared toward a younger, higher-income customer with higher performance car needs than the 800 mall-based Sears Auto Centres, Baffico said. Because of the existence of the mall stores, the retailer chose not to include the Sears name in National Tire and Battery. ""From a location strategy standpoint, a different name allows us to be closer to a Sears store without cannabilizing the market,"" Baffico said. Areas targeted for new tire stores this year are Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Rochester, N.Y. and Buffalo, N.Y. Sears will also add a small number of Sears Auto Centre stores in malls, Baffico said. Separately, Sears plans to spend more than $650 million to add 780 Parts America auto parts stores by the year 2002 and to transform 240 Western Auto stores to Parts America, he said. ""We should be by 2002 the clear No. 2 in parts,"" Baffico said. That category is currently led by Memphis, Tenn.-based AutoZone Inc., followed by Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe &amp; Jack of Philadelphia, based on revenues. Sears' parts group had $1.4 billion in revenue in 1996. Since the parts stores do not compete with Sears' mall stores, the company will decide by the end of the summer whether to include the Sears name in the name of the stores, Baffico said. One analyst said that Sears' expansion plans for the automotive group were aggressive, but noted that the company was being even more aggressive in other formats. ""Those are relatively aggressive, but remember they're coming from a place where they've been a little stagnant for a while,"" Stephen Latz, of A.G. Edwards, said of the auto group expansion plans.

"Elizabeth Forsyth, former aide to Polly Peck Plc head Asil Nadir, left court on Friday still awaiting the outcome of her appeal against a money-laundering conviction but enjoying her first taste of freedom in 10 months. The London Court of Appeal reserved judgment her appeal after a two-day hearing. Forsyth, 60, spent the last 10 months in jail after being found guilty last year on two counts of dishonestly handling a total of 400,000 pounds ($640,000). She was freed on bail on Thursday when the court quashed her original five-year sentence, which it said was disproportionate, and concluded she had already served long enough in prison. But after the conclusion of Forsyth's appeal and arguments by the prosecution that the conviction should stand, the court said it could not make an immediate ruling on whether it would also quash the conviction which would clear Forsyth. ""We desire to reserve our judgment in this matter...we will give our decision as soon as we can,"" Lord Justice Beldam told the court. The three judges said they were unable to give an immediate result as the appeal had raised complex issues. The prosecution said the money Forsyth was convicted of handling had been stolen by Nadir from fruits-to-electronics firm Polly Peck, which collapsed in 1990 under massive debts. Nadir still faces fraud and theft charges in Britain after he fled to his native northern Cyprus in 1993, jumping bail of 3.5 million pounds. Forsyth's barrister, Geoffrey Robertson, argued during the appeal hearing that her conviction was unsafe on a number of grounds, including the fact that Nadir had not been questioned via a video-link from northern Cyprus and the money Forsyth had transferred in Geneva was not in fact stolen. ""It involves so many complex issues of law it was inevitable that judgement should be reserved,"" Peter Krivinskas, Forsyth's lawyer, told Reuters after the judge's announcement. Krivinskas said the appeal was a case ""which could set legal precendent,"" adding that it was difficult to gauge how the appeal had been received by the court. ""We don't want to tempt providence,"" he said. Forsyth, who on Thursday described her period in jail as ""an experience,"" told Reuters she would be returning her mother's home. ""I'm going to go home and just relax for the weekend. I enjoy the countryside and will go for a long walk,"" she added. Her 90-year-old mother, Margaret Macalpine, was in court to hear the second day of the appeal. She told Reuters outside the courtroom she had been ""stunned"" when her daughter had been released. ""We just couldn't take it in. We were very excited,"" she said, adding the telephone had not stopped ringing since. ""I've had a quiet time while she was in prison. It's going to be hectic now,"" she said, adding that Forsyth had many friends who had supported her throughout. Lawyers said the appeal court's judgement could take as long as a month to be decided.

"A small but fast-growing bank which lends only to socially and environmentally-friendly projects said on Wednesday it had more than doubled in size in its first full year in Britain. Independently-owned Triodos Bank, which was founded in the Netherlands in 1980 and now has offices in Britain and Belgium, lends only to what it describes as projects ""with social and environmental objectives"". It said its level of savings in Britain had grown by 111 percent in 1996 to 20.2 million pounds ($32.1 million) from 11.3 million pounds in 1995 and its loan portfolio by 117 percent to 10.2 million pounds from 5.6 million pounds. ""We are delighted with our first year's results in the UK. We are continuing to see substantial interest from both savers and borrowers looking for a positive ethical approach to banking,"" said Glen Saunders, the bank's managing director in Britain. While Britain's big six high street banks have reported combined profits of 12.6 billion pounds in 1996, up from 10.8 billion pounds in 1995, Triodos earlier said its net profit for the year was a mere 342,000 pounds, up from 262,000 the previous year. But Triodos now has 2,598 savings accounts in Britain compared to 1,358 at the end of 1995. It has attracted British media interest after launching new types of savings accounts and funds promoting fair trade during 1996. The bank, whose British operation was started in Bristol in the west of England in July 1995, said the growth had been secured on a threefold increase in its capital base, following a share issue in the Netherlands. A significant proportion of the new shareholding came from Dutch and Belgian financial institutions, including Rabobank Nederland and Commercial Union subsidiary Delta Lloyd. Saunders said this influx of non-voting shareholders had shown ""increasing mainstream recognition"" of the bank's ""experience in lending to the social economy"". The bank has so far lent to projects including a wind farm in Cumbria, north-west England, and organic milk suppliers co-operative, an environmentally-friendly housing development in a Welsh national park and a housing association which provides homes for people with special needs. Triodos has also become involved in so-called ""microcredit"" programmes in developing countries, where it lends to impoverished people to develop projects which then generate income, helping them to work their way out of poverty. ""Microcredit is sensitive to the local economy, does not create dependency and is self-sustaining as the money repaid is 'recycled' to other borrowers,"" Triodos said in a background statement. The bank, which had only 62 staff at the end of 1996, has also branched out into specialised fund management, including funds managed on behalf of charities and governments. Its Green Investment Fund, established last year, has raised 8.0 million pounds for investment in recognised ""green"" enterprises while the Wind Fund has raised around 4.0 million for investment in wind farms and other renewable energy projects. The bank's combined balance sheet, which includes its Dutch and Belgian operations, grew by 54 percent in 1996 to reach 161.9 million pounds at the end of the year.

"Britain's minister handling Hong Kong's 1997 transfer to China will confer with London's colonial governor and other officials this weekend after opening the way to a breakthrough in handover arrangements with Beijing. Jeremy Hanley, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, arrives in Hong Kong on Friday night to discuss the state of play in negotiations following his recent visit to Beijing, which was marked by a warming of relations. Hanley, wrapping up a tour of Asia, will meet Governor Chris Patten and the territory's quasi cabinet, the Executive Council, to brief them on his recent talks with China's Hong Kong policy supremo Lu Ping. They would also discuss how Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind would handle his next meeting with China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, likely to take place at the United Nations General Assembly session in New York later this month. A well-placed western diplomatic source said Hanley's talks in China had produced progress on the long-stalled and thorny issue of a joint handover ceremony when a century and a half of British rule ends, at midnight next June 30. ""The main thing was that he made good progress on the handover ceremony, and an announcement on this could come quite soon,"" the diplomatic source said. A deal on the ceremony in 291 days' time to mark this closing chapter of Britain's empire was now very close, the source said. He added that there was some hope that Britain's Prince Charles might attend. A government spokesman said Hanley's visit to Hong Kong was a ""pulse-feeling mission"" and that Patten was keen to hear first hand about the latest contacts with Lu Ping. Hanley arrives in Hong Kong on the eve of the departure of Britain's diplomatic negotiating team to Beijing for a session of the Joint Liaison Group forum haggling over the handover. This year had seen a significant shift to cordial relations between Britain and China, the diplomatic source said. Progress was made on ""substantive economic issues"", although on the political front less had been achieved, he said. London and Beijing have long bickered over the transition, with discord over the handover ceremony once so entrenched that prospects of a joint ceremony seemed in doubt. China, infuriated by Patten's expansion of democracy in the colony, was once said to have insisted that he should not attend. But Lu told Hanley in Beijing he would seal the handover next year in a ceremonial handshake with Patten. Another obstacle has been China's plan to dissolve Hong Kong's elected Legislative council and supplant it with an appointed ""provisional legislature"", which Britain opposes. ""China has managed to change the tone of its approach to Hong Kong without shifting its stance on the provisional legislature,"" the diplomatic source said. Recently political analysts have noted softer Chinese policy utterances on Hong Kong, including offers of dialogue with the Democratic Party, long a fierce critic of Beijing, and an attempt to inject more candidates into the contest for the territory's first post-colonial leader, or Chief Executive. An unprecedented exchange of letters between the Democrats and China this month came after the British side encouraged the party to open a dialogue with the Chinese and China to be more receptive to the group, a Hong Kong official said on Friday. China has promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under the handover treaty with Britain, and no change to the colony's freewheeling capitalist system for 50 years under a ""one country two systems"" policy aimed at reunifying Chinese territories.

"Edmark Corp, a U.S. maker of educational computer software for children, said on Monday that chairman and chief executive Sally Narodick had resigned for stress-related health reasons. The company said Donna Stanger, vice-president for product development, would temporarily assume the duties of chief executive while the board of directors searched for a permanent successor. Frances Conley, a director of the company and principal of Roanoke Capital Ltd, will serve as chairman of the board. ""As you can well imagine, it's an extremely difficult thing for me to acknowledge that I'm not a rock and I'm not invincible, and I'm having a tough time with that,"" Narodick told a news conference. She said she first began experiencing symptoms including fatigue in June and took a two-week holiday. After returning to work, she again suffered symptoms including fatigue, insomnia and weight loss. Late last month her doctors recommended that she take steps to lower her stress level.   ""I don't have energy... It's pretty clear that I need to take quite a bit of time off to rest and heal myself, and in this kind of environment the company needs somebody who's going to be fully in charge."" Narodick said. Her resignation comes at a time when the market for educational software is increasingly crowded, forcing Edmark and its rivals to drive down prices and compete fiercely for precious shelf space. Edmark officials declined to comment on persistent speculation within the industry that the company might become a takeover candidate but said the change in top management would not alter their options. Stanger said the company could continue to be a ""very strong niche player"" or could elect to merge ""if the need for scale becomes important enough"". Conley said Edmark would survive the current turmoil within the company and the industry, noting the company's talent pool of more than 200 employees and strong balance sheet including more than $25 million in cash as of June 30. Narodick, who said she had ""great confidence"" in Stanger, will remain on Edmark's board. ","MartinWolk"
"Hong Kong witnessed another vote in favour of the status quo on Wednesday when future leader Tung Chee-hwa appointed Financial Secretary Donald Tsang to manage the US$19 billion Land Fund after July 1. The move was interpreted as a vote of support for the outspoken Tsang, whose continued influence as one of Hong Kong's most senior civil servants has long been viewed as an indication of top tier stability as the handover to China approaches. ""That is interesting. That would indicate Donald Tsang is not being marginalised as some people were speculating,"" said Bob Broadfoot of the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy. Broadfoot was referring to Tung's decision to appoint Tsang chairman of a Land Fund Committee to be established when Hong Kong becomes a Special Administrative Region of China on July 1. The Land Fund's management threatened to turn into something of a political football when Tsang's post-handover status was debated earlier this year. A bitter opponent of Tung's proposals to alter Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, Tsang's continued tenure as Financial Secretary after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control in 48 days was considered less than certain. Tsang was eventually confirmed, but in February, Tung said he was considering changes in the reporting structure at the territory's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Instead of reporting to Tsang, Tung suggested that HKMA chief Joseph Yam might report directly to the chief executive, effectively sidelining Tsang. But no changes have been announced. And Tsang's appointment as controller of the Land Fund was interpreted as a sign that changes were unlikely. ""That puts him back in the reporting arrangement between Tung and Yam, doesn't it?"" said Broadfoot. Tung said on Wednesday that the HKMA will manage the fund under Tsang's direction. The Land Fund was established in 1984 to assuage Chinese concern about Britain's intentions. The fund, made up of proceeds from government property sales, now exceeds HK$150 billion -- equivalent to Hong Kong's fiscal reserves. Half of land sales proceeds were remitted directly to the colonial government. The other half was held in escrow in the Land Fund to revert to the post-colonial government. The fund has become so large that its inclusion into the existing reserves, or Exchange Fund, threaten to boost the Hong Kong dollar and put pressure on the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar peg. Any change to Hong Kong's independent monetary system could undermine corporate confidence in the territory after the transition, experts said. The status of the territory's top three civil servants is being watched closely in Hong Kong. Tsang, Chief Secretary Anson Chan and the future secretary for justice are automatic members of Tung's inner cabinet, or Executive Council. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843-6352 ","SarahDavison"
"Britain's securities market watchdog said on Tuesday it had disciplined former Barings executive James Bax -- completing the cases of managers blamed for the bank's collapse. Barings went bust in February 1995 under the weight of some 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) of losses racked up in unauthorised derivatives trades by trader Nick Leeson, currently languishing in a Singapore jail. The SFA started proceedings against nine former senior executives of Barings but did not proceed against Peter Baring and Andrew Tuckey, chairman and deputy chairman respectively of Barings group. The nine were former chief executive Peter Norris, Ron Baker, Bax, Geoff Broadhust, Tony Gamby, Tony Hawes, Ian Hopkins, George Maclean and Mary Walz. Of these nine, only Hopkins and Baker have any outstanding business with the SFA. After its spectacular collapse, Barings was taken over by Dutch financial services group Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV and now operates as ING Barings. The spotlight now turns to Britain's Department of Trade which this week confirmed it has started legal proceedings which could ban the Barings nine plus Tuckey from being directors of any British company for up to 15 years. The DTI said it would hold preliminary hearings and then would set a timetable for a final hearing of the cases. And as if that wasn't enough, Norris, Tuckey, Baker, Walz, Hopkins, Gamby, Broadhurst and Bax also face writs from accountancy firm Cooper's &amp; Lybrand in third party proceedings after it was sued by Barings administrator Ernst &amp; Young for what is thought to be around 1.0 billion pounds. Hopkins was recently banned for three years from being a director in the City and required to pay 10,000 pounds of costs. Though technically he is still able to appeal against his sentence, he is thought unlikely to do so. Meanwhile, Baker, who as head of financial products played a central role in the Barings affair, is appealing against a reprimand handed out to him in November even though more serious charges had not been proved. Baring and Tuckey left Barings after giving assurances that they would never seek top management jobs in the financial markets. Penalties handed out to the others have ranged from reprimands to three year bans with costs of up to 10,000 pounds. Bax was suspended from being a City director for 21 months and will also pay costs of 10,000 pounds after the SFA found some mitigating circumstances for his conduct. The SFA said it had taken into account, among other matters, that Bax had no product responsibility for the trading activities of Leeson nor any knowledge of futures and options trading. Bax's suspension will run from March 1996, the date when the SFA started proceedings against him. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds) ","JoeOrtiz"
"Telecommunications firm Mitel Corp sees growth in the computer telephony integration business lagging expectations, Chief Executive John Millard told Reuters on Friday. ""It's certainly come more slowly than we anticipated and we see projections of the volume of business in this area being pushed back, but I can tell you that there's tremendous interest in the networks,"" Millard said in a phone interview. Ottawa-based Mitel has stumbled in recent months because its computer telephony integration (CTI) unit, which makes lines and equipment to combine telephone and data into one network, did not achieve forecast results. Mitel warned investors in late February that it expected fourth-quarter earnings to fall to C$0.10 a share in the period ending March 31 from year earlier C$0.14 a share.

"Japanese life insurers may ask for support from banks to liquidate failed Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co, industry sources said on Friday. While life insurers have basically agreed to provide a total of 200 billion yen to help liquidate the firm, they are worried whether their contributions will be enough to cover losses resulting from the failure, they said. Nissan Life was ordered by the Finance Ministry to start shutting down its business on April 25. It was the first failure of a life insurance firm in Japan in the post-war period. Nissan Life's liabilities were estimated to have exceeded its assets by 200 billion yen. ""If the life insurance industry alone cannot cover the losses, we may ask for some kind of support from banks which have business ties with Nissan Mutual Life,"" one industry source said. He said that there were more than 100 banks and credit associations with business ties to Nissan Life. Koichi Yoshida, the president-designate of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co, said this week that banks should help sort out the collapse of Nissan Life. An official at the Life Insurance Association of Japan, which was appointed by the Finance Ministry to work out a scheme to wind up Nissan Life, said it had not yet done so as it was still examining the firm's financial situation. It will take three weeks or more to complete the inspection, the official said. Association chairman Kenjiro Hata told reporters last month it may also seek capital contributions from major clients of Nissan Life -- Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Hitachi Ltd. Industry sources said that Nissan Life policy holders would probably be asked to accept an increase in premiums or cuts in payments. They said that the most likely liquidation scheme would involve the establishment of a joint company to take over Nissan Life's assets. However, one estimate had shown that the new company could post losses of some 30 billion yen a year if conditions of existing insurance contracts were not changed, the sources said. Nearly half of Nissan Life's 2.1 trillion yen in assets are individual pension policies that have guaranteed high returns. Many were contracted in the late-1980s bubble economy era. When interest rates fell and the stock market languished following the collapse of the bubble economy, a large gap developed between investment yields and guaranteed returns to policy holders.

"A report into the emergency evacuation of a Cathay Pacific Airways 0293.HK Boeing 777 on June 23 which injured several passengers has recommended design examinations of the cargo hold smoke detection system and emergency slides, a Cathay press release said. It said results of an investigation by Cathay and the territory's Civil Aviation Department into the evacuation of the Cathay 777-200 lists five main conclusions and three recommendations. The newly-introduced twin jet had just landed at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport after a flight from Bangkok when there was a smoke warning in the forward hold which contained wet cargo and high humidity levels. The captain ordered the evacuation of all 306 passengers and 15 crew. Several people were injured when they hit the ground. The alarm turned out to be false, the report said. The report recommends Boeing examine the design of the cargo smoke detection system. It also calls on the U.S. manufacturer to investigate the effectiveness of the escape slide deceleration features. A third recommendation suggests the Civil Aviation Department and the airport fire services make it easier for airline crew members to identify the leader of the rescue mission and his command vehicle. In a statement, Cathay Pacific managing director Rod Eddington said the commander's decision to evacuate was correct. ""There was no suggestion by the investigation that either the cockpit crew or the cabin crew acted in anything other than a highly professional manner,"" Eddington said. Cathay said that to prevent further false alarms it will shortly begin modifying the 777's smoke detection system to prevent condensation building up on the sensing surface. Until modifications are complete by the end of the year, Cathay will ban wet cargoes, the statement added. Cathay said the experience gained when 777 slides were used for the first time under true emergency conditions might be used by Boeing to refine future designs. ""There is no suggestion the slides are unsafe. They functioned as designed and the aircraft was empty in less than two minutes. However, the report does recommend examining ways to improve the deceleration of people as they come down the slides in wet conditions and we are discussing this with Boeing and the Civil Aviation Department,"" Eddington added. Cathay currently has a fleet of four 777-200 aircraft with a firm order for seven 777-300s and 10 options. The report in no way undermined Cathay's confidence Cathay in the aircraft, Eddington stated. ""Apart from this one incident, it has had an outstanding entry into service, with the best serviceability of any aircraft we have ever operated and we are delighted with its performance,"" he said. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc surged on Friday on market hopes that Britain's second biggest telecoms company was poised to seal a deal with China, ending some uncertainty over the future of its biggest asset -- Hong Kong Telecom. The stock jumped 26.5p to 524p by 1130 GMT after Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd announced that C&amp;W was in discussions with China on future cooperation. ""We understand that these discussions are continuing but there is no certainty as to how and when these will be concluded or as to their effect in relation to Hong Kong Telecom,"" the company said in a statement. C&amp;W, which declined to comment further, has said it has been in talks with China for some time. But the statement fuelled market hopes that a deal was imminent. With Hong Kong reverting to Chinese rule at midnight in just 24 days, analysts expect C&amp;W to be encouraged to reduce its near 59 percent stake in the main telephone service provider on the island -- in return for growth opportunities on the booming Chinese mainland. A sharp rise in Hong Kong Telecom's (HKT) shares to a new year high of HK$19.25 also assumes significant mainland Chinese access, analysts say. However, some experts say that although the potential for growth in China is indisputable, the ability to make attractive returns from investments in that growth remains unproven. But with a deal widely expected, analysts are now focusing on how big a stake C&amp;W would sell, at what discount, whether the Chinese would offer an asset swap -- or if C&amp;W gets cash, how it would match the hefty returns HKT used to generate when reinvesting disposal proceeds. ""There could be a scenario whereby Hong Kong Telecom just swaps some assets with the Chinese...in return for a certain percentage in HKT which would solve the Chinese cash burden,"" said one analyst, who declined to be named. ""They have to lay a lot of lines over the next couple of years. Then it's a question of what the Chinese are going to give up? You're not going to be running the Beijing telephone company,"" he added. China has already secured a 7.74 percent stake in Hong Kong Telecom at a 15 percent discount via a company called China Everbright Group, which is directly under the supervision of China's State Council. ""Holdings in other British-controlled Hong Kong companies have in the past been sold to the Chinese at substantial share price discounts,"" notes C&amp;W's brokers, ABN AMRO Hoare Govett. But it adds: ""A deal in Hong Kong would reinforce the bull case for C&amp;W by removing uncertainty over prospects, while underpinning sum of the parts valuations of the company, which suggests that the shares are worth around 650p."" Few analysts believe C&amp;W will want to lose majority control of HKT, which contributes 65-70 percent of its profits and offers a robust return on equity of 49 percent, according to Reuters Security 3000 data. But some say the British company may have to reach a compromise with China, albeit ""kicking and screaming"". Nevertheless, a sale could leave C&amp;W with 1.0 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) or more to invest. Deals tipped by experts include a share buy-back or special dividend at both C&amp;W and HKT, buying the remaining 50 percent in C&amp;W's mobile venture One2One from its joint-owner, U S West Inc, or telecoms investments in the Chinese mainland.

"Microsoft Corp. said Thursday its third-quarter profit jumped 85 percent to $1.04 billion, well beyond analysts' expectations, on strength in its core Windows business and the new Office 97 upgrade. The software giant's net income of 79 cents a share compared with earnings of $562 million, or 44 cents a share, in last year's fiscal third quarter. Revenues rose to a record $3.21 billion, a 45 percent increase over the $2.21 billion racked up in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average had forecast earnings of 64 cents a share and revenues of about $2.9 billion. While Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated that he expects growth to slow over the next year, analysts said they were impressed by the software giant's continuing ability to rack up huge gains. ""I was floored,"" said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie, who predicted the stock would rise sharply Friday as analysts jack up their earnings estimates. ""This was a 16-cylinder engine, and all cylinders were working."" Microsoft released the results after financial markets closed. In Nasdaq trading Thursday Microsoft fell 12.5 cents to $98.125, but the stock rose as high as $102.75 in after-hours trading, dealers said. Microsoft credited strong revenues from the Office 97 bundle, released in January, which helped drive application and content revenues to $1.53 billion, up 24 percent from the year-earlier period. But revenues from Microsoft's platform products, including the various Windows operating systems, rose 73 percent to $1.68 billion. Sales of software preloaded on new computers to the so-called OEM (original equipment manufacturer) channel, rose 51 percent, faster than the PC growth rate, reflecting a continued shift to the higher-priced Windows 95 operating system from the older Windows 3.x. In an interview, Brown said he expected growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons with year-earlier quarters and a lack of planned major new upgrades. Brown said he was ""very excited"" about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an ""all-time Olympic record."" ""We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS (earnings per share) went up 80 percent,"" he said. ""That's not a quarter-in, quarter-out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter."" In fact, he said results from the current fourth quarter would be roughly equivalent to the period that just ended, and he predicted a modest sequential decline in revenues and earnings in the seasonally slow September quarter. But after that sequential growth should resume, Brown said. Because Microsoft exceeded third-quarter expectations by 15 cents per share, analysts likely will have to raise fiscal 1997 estimates to about $2.65 per share from the previous $2.35, McAdams said. Fiscal 1998 estimates also are likely to be raised, he said. McAdams also pointed out that the company's ""unearned"" revenues of $1.29 billion included an additional 13 cents per share that was taken in but not recognised as earnings in the quarter. Microsoft defers some revenues to account for costs over the life cycle of products such as Windows and Office. While Microsoft routinely beats earnings estimates, analysts said they had not even heard a ""whisper"" of the blowout number, and Microsoft's stock has traded in a relatively narrow range over the past two months. ""It's just an extraordinarily well-managed company to deliver that kind of earnings upside on this size of a revenue base,"" said analyst David Readerman of Montgomery Securities. ","MartinWolk"
"Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd, expected to report a sharp fall in half year profit on Wednesday, is shopping around for a new chief executive just as retailing conditions are expected to turn for the better. Analysts said Chris Tideman who resigned as CEO on Tuesday was the victim of a weak retail environment at a time when David Jones was spending more on opening new stores and restructuring. David Jones has disappointed investors since it listed in November 1995 with its failure to match prospectus forecasts.   ""I think the cycle worked against them,"" a Melbourne retailing analyst said. ""They have underperformed the cycle and that is a bit of a shame. That reflects the costs of the new store openings."" Analysts said Tideman may have been trying to do too much at one time. David Jones was introducing new systems to manage its inventory as well as increasing its range of private label merchandise and restructuring its buying department. The retailer had also restructured its South Australian operations and announced plans to expand into Western Australia and New Zealand.   ""They have committed themselves to a lot of new stores and so far the new stores they have opened up ... are loss making and they have committed themselves to other new stores so their cost structure is a bit pumped up,"" said Simon Shakesheff a retail analyst at Macquarie Equities. David Jones' share price has hardly been above its A$2.00 issue price since the float. The group is due to release its results for the 26 weeks to January 25 on Wednesday. In January, the retailer said it expected its results to be up to 50 percent down on a year ago.   Tideman cited personal reasons for leaving and the company said he would return to Britain. Analysts expect David Jones to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$20 million and A$22 million. The dividend is expected to be about three cents a share for the 1996/97 first half. David Jones reported a net profit before abnormals of A$44.2 million for the 1995/96 first half and a dividend of six cents a share. Analysts estimate the full 1996/97 year result to be between A$34 million and A$38 million.   The retailer reported a net profit of A$67.53 million in the 1995/96 year, which was up on the 1995 prospectus forecast of A$64.6 million, but its 1995/96 sales were below forecasts. Analysts were mixed about the outlook. Some said the new chief had a tough job ahead due to re-invigorated Coles Myer Ltd owned Grace Bros-Myer department stores and the entry into the local market by Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer. But other analysts said Australia's retail outlook for 1997 had improved and that the restructuring of David Jones was almost complete, meaning the new chief should not have as bumpy a ride as Tideman since he joined the group in 1994.   ""It could be a dream job, coming in at the bottom of the cycle and six months away from full systems implemention,"" said John Burgess, a retail analyst at Pru-Bache Securities. ""We have had two bad Christmases in 1995 and 1996,"" Burgess said. ""You will reach the bottom of the spending cycle in the next two quarters, so you have spending on the rise, albeit slowly, towards the end of 1997,"" he said. Analysts said David Jones may even announce the new chief executive on Wednesday. Investors reacted positively to Tideman's exit, pushing up the shares by three cents to A$1.74. About 1.21 million shares had traded by 2.15 p.m. (0315 GMT). ","KevinMorrison"
"Lloyd's of London announced Tuesday it will give backers more time to meet planned increases in the capital they must put up to support their underwriting activities. Lloyd's has also dropped proposals to prevent Names -- as the traditional backers of the insurance market are called -- from using their own homes as collateral for underwriting. The planned capital increases are part of a package of measures designed to strengthen the financial security that underpins Lloyd's and to provide a level playing field between Names and corporate members. The longer transition period for the changes announced Tuesday may go some way to meeting the concerns of Names' representatives, who had called for more time to be given to meet the new capital requirements. Names fear they are gradually being forced out of the market in favour of corporate capital first introduced in 1994, a charge repeatedly denied by the Lloyd's hierachy. Names are to be given three years before they have to meet the new requirements of showing evidence of assets amounting to 50 percent of the premiums they underwrite. In a Lloyd's working party report last month, a two-year transition period was proposed but, after consultations, that has been extended from 1999 to the year 2000. A phased increase in Names' minimum level of means to 350,000 pounds ($571,000) from the current level of 250,000 pounds ($409,000) has also been increased from two to five years and will take effect in 2002. This 350,000 pounds ($571,000) will be made up of funds held at Lloyd's and evidence of ""other personal wealth"" (OPW). Proposals to double the OPW requirements for 2000 and beyond have been dropped in favour of a slightly higher level of funds which must be held at Lloyd's. At present, Names must put up between 20 percent and 30 percent of the total business they back, compared with 50 percent for corporate members. By 2000, Names will have to hold 40 percent of premium capacity at Lloyd's with OPW making up a further 10 percent, bringing them into line with corporate members. The use of ""principal private residences"" (PPRs) -- Names' own homes -- as collateral for members' underwriting will be allowed to continue but only for those in existence at the end of 1994. The Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM), which represents Names' interests, broadly welcomed Tuesday's proposals, saying it was essential that all Names should demonstrate their ability to meet any losses they incurred.

"A rapid deterioration in Britain's science base is putting a question mark over future investment in the country's world-beating pharmaceutical industry, according to major companies. Two of the biggest domestic players, Glaxo Wellcome Plc and SmithKline Beecham Plc, have issued veiled warnings that unless a rapid decline in the quality of graduate training and basic education is reversed they will be forced to site increasing amounts of research abroad. ""We may be looking at the demise of yet another historically successful industry,"" George Poste, SmithKline Beecham's chairman of research and development (R&amp;D), told Reuters. ""I don't see how any society that does not keep up (scientifically) can become anything other than a second-tier nation. It is quite stunning and it is just not seen here."" At the root of concerns is the drive over the past 10 years to inflate the number of 18-year-olds going through higher education, which the companies say is stretching resources and forcing standards down across the board. Michael Elves, Glaxo Wellcome's director of scientific and educational affairs, said that although the company could cream off the brightest of Britain's graduates, they arrived with disappointing levels of numeracy, literacy and computer skills. Even more alarming for the skill-intensive industry is the lack of basic laboratory experience due to clapped out, antiquated equipment and sheer pressure of numbers. SmithKline's Poste said the need for ""remedial training"" of up to two years was acting as a hidden tax on the industry, which could add to the pressure to site future investment in the United States or the increasingly competitive Asian economies. FIRMS INVEST HEAVILY IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH Both Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline have invested huge sums in Britain. Glaxo spent more than 700 million pounds ($1.13 billion) on its research centre at Stevenage, north of London, while SmithKline has poured 256 million pounds into facilities to be opened in April at its Harlow site to the east of the capital. Poste said the investment was ""an act of faith"" that was in danger of not being repeated. SmithKline Beecham has already shifted its microbiology operations to the United States because of a lack of relevant skills, and there are fears that other key areas could follow. ""For our survival it makes sense to put our resources in the place where we can find the best,"" added Glaxo's Elves. ""For a long time the UK science base was of high status and supplied what we needed, a pool of highly qualified world class scientists and technologists, but one has doubts now."" A larger slice of Glaxo's academic collaboration budget already goes abroad, reaching 27 percent last year from five percent in 1988/89. The industry, which invests more than two billion pounds a year on R&amp;D, roughly equal to its trade surplus with the rest of the world, is sensitive to charges of special pleading. PHARMACUETICALS - A 'SUNRISE' INDUSTRY IN BRITAIN Peter Fellner, chief executive of the biotech company Celltech Group Plc, said: ""We don't have too many sunrise industries, and we should make a fuss of those we do have. Pharmaceuticals and biotech is one area where we have done extremely well compared with other European nations."" Industry figures show that five of the current top twenty best-selling drugs internationally were discovered and developed in British laboratories, and Britain accounts for the lion's share of Europe's biotech industry. While Britain's research eminence is under threat, the job of drug discovery is increasingly complex. Information technology, high-speed screening of chemical entities, robotics and the evaluation of genetic factors behind disease are revolutionising research. Zeneca Group Plc's director of research and development Peter Doyle said ""the qualities demanded of people in new drug discovery are very much greater than when I joined 30 years ago. We expect a formidable array of skills and the ability to take on a whole lot of new skills."" POLITICIANS BLAMED FOR INDIFFERENCE The big three companies all point the finger at indifference among politicians and a deterioration in higher education, which they say is suffering from a fall in funding per student and declining entrance standards as well as equipment shortages. ""University research conditions are appalling,"" said Glaxo Wellcome's Elves. ""The present system was designed for five to eight percent of the elite 18-year-olds and is now being forced to take 30 percent. It can't work."" Poste, Elves and Doyle said funding needed to be more elitist, with costly equipment and laboratory training reserved for a core of excellence rather than being spread thinly. The companies hope for progress on the issue through the government-sponsored Dearing review of higher education, which is due to report later this year. Glaxo Wellcome has proposed the creation of two-tier science degrees. Two-year bachelor degrees in scientific theory would be followed by specialised masters' courses providing practical training for smaller numbers. Another issue the companies want addressed is the lack of courses for skilled technicians, which Zeneca's Doyle said had worsened with the conversion of the more vocational polytechnics to universities. And they said action needed to be taken at schools. Science subjects have failed to keep up with a boom in numbers of students taking Advanced Levels, the passport to university entrance. Glaxo's Elves said the national curriculum ""is too restrictive and divorces everything from reality."" ""Success in science is not that different to success in sport,"" said SmithKline's Poste. ""It requires great discipline and there are premier leagues and other leagues. If Britain wants to play in the premier league...somebody has got to grasp the nettle.""

"China is considering restrictions on foreign investment in textiles, garments and sectors where domestic production capacity is already excessive, a senior official of the State Statistical Bureau said on Tuesday. ""The production capacity of some of our traditional industries, such as textiles and garments, is pitifully excessive,"" Li Qiming, director of the bureau's department of industry and transportation statistics, told Reuters. ""We are currently considering...whether to restrict foreign businessmen from entering sectors in which domestic production capacity is already abundant,"" Li said. He did not elaborate. The losses of state enterprises in these industries exceed the national average, Li said but gave no specific figures. China has said it would curb textile output and unnecessary expansion in the industry in 1997 to reduce losses in the state sector. It has set a target of phasing out obsolete textile equipment, including 10 million cotton spindles. ""There were 429 state textile enterprises that posted losses of more than five million yuan ($602,000) each in 1995. Their combined losses reached 5.21 billion yuan."" ""Indigenous enterprises are being squeezed...in some traditional industries,"" Li told a news conference. ""We may have to consider protection,"" he said. The bureau spent one year and mobilised five million pollsters to conduct a survey of industries that showed that foreign investment was concentrated mainly in electronics, telecommunications, textile, garment and food processing, officials said. China's 10 eastern coastal provinces and provincial-level cities have attracted 87 percent of total foreign investment, while five provinces in northwest China took in less than one percent of foreign investment, Li said. The survey showed 59,311 wholly foreign-owned and Sino-foreign joint ventures had set up in China by the end of 1995, up 29,343, or 97.9 percent compared with end-1994. Their combined output value was 1.2 trillion yuan ($144.6 billion) at end-1995, the survey showed. They made profits totalling 79.2 billion and paid 39.8 billion yuan in taxes. The number of foreign-funded enterprises accounted for 10 percent of the total number of enterprises in China, but the output of foreign firms accounted for 20 percent of the total. Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen were the biggest investors, accounting for 32.6 percent of the total. It was inevitable that the government would impose restrictions on foreign investment in industries to protect the state sector, analysts said. About 38 percent of state enterprises registered losses in 1996 compared with the previous year, Li said. Losses posted by state firms soared 37.53 percent in 1996, he said. Pre-tax profits of state enterprises slipped 4.83 percent in 1996 while after-tax profits plunged 42.5 percent. Excessive stockpiles accounted for 20 percent of funds tied up by finished products. Debts owed among enterprises worsened, with collectibles of state enterprises increasing by 11.8 percent in 1996. ($1 = 8.3 yuan) ","BenjaminKangLim"
"Inmet Mining Corp chief executive Bill James has one focus for the company he has led for the past six months: Antamina. The huge copper and zinc discovery in Peru holds a resource of at least 400 million tonnes of ore, but the deposit requires at least US$1.5 billion to develop. Inmet shares the deposit 50-50 with Rio Algom Ltd. ""We're going to focus on Antamina and hopefully that will turn out to be a very profitable mine,"" James said on Friday in an interview. ""Our trick is going to be to finance it. We have very limited cash flow right now,"" he said. ""It'll be a difficult situation. But we're going to do it."" How? ""Well, at some stage we'll probably do some underwritings and we'll sell off some assets. With the combination of that, we think we can handle our share,"" James said, springing out of his chair and pacing the room. ""We're going to do it,"" he bellowed, shaking his clenched fists above his head. ""We are definitely going to do it."" But James is not starting from a position of strength. The copper, zinc and gold company posted a 1996 loss of C$364 million -- one million dollars for every day of the year, as James puts it. ""Nobody would call that too healthy."" James, 68, who is still officially chief executive at Denison Mines Ltd, was brought to Inmet last September to turn around the company. Denison would likely name a successor next week, said James, a former chief executive of Falconbridge Ltd. Since James took the Inmet helm, the company has written down C$355 million in assets, including its solution mining at Copper Range in Michigan and its Bougrine zinc and lead mine in Tunisia. It also wrote off a big chunk of its investment in the Izok Lake copper and zinc prospect in Canada's Northwest Territories and its investment at the Cayeli copper and zinc project in Turkey. The company also faces low grades and rising costs at its young Troilus gold mine in northern Quebec. A recent study on the Petaquilla copper-gold exploration property in Panama showed the project would probably not be economic under current conditions. Inmet has 48 percent of the project, with Teck Corp holding 26 percent and the rest held by Adrian Resources Ltd. James would not say which assets were for sale. But he said he was sure the company could get at least book value or C$17 million for its stake in Petaquilla, ""a little bit"" for Bougrine and at least C$25 million for Izok Lake. ""We're not in any rush to sell these things off and we don't want anyone going around these properties kicking tires,"" he warned.

"The No. 2 bidder at the government's high-flying wireless phone auction last year has filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors, underscoring the problems besetting the auction's winners. Pocket Communications Inc., which bid $1.4 billion for 43 licenses to offer a new generation of cellular service, said Tuesday it took the step voluntarily to protect its assets from a group of creditors after defaulting on $80 million in loans. Pocket is one of several top bidders in the government's $10.2 billion auction that have come under pressure from the high prices and hefty interest payments required to pay for the ""personal communication services"" (PCS) licenses. The companies, including No. 1 bidder NextWave Telecom Inc., also have come under strain because of a reluctance on Wall Street to finance PCS ventures. Pocket is the first company from the pricey 1996 auction known to have filed for bankruptcy protection. The sale was reserved for small companies. Privately-held Pocket's big creditors include a group of Asian entrepreneurs and communications-equipment makers Siemens AG of Germany and L.M. Ericsson of Sweden. ""It enables the company to develop a plan to improve our financial health"" while continuing to build a wireless phone system, Pocket Chairman Daniel Riker said of the company's filing Monday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Pocket, based in Washington, said it would take ""several months"" to restructure its finances and business affairs before the company would emerge from the Chapter 11 process on firm financial footing. The Federal Communications Commission on Monday gave PCS companies from last year's auction some breathing space when it suspended indefinitely a March 31 deadline for them to make payments to the agency for their licenses. The FCC took the step while mulling a request from NextWave, Pocket and seven other winners for permission to make the payments annually instead of quarterly. The bids have become loans from the government, with the winners paying interest on the money owed for the licenses. ""When you're out trying to raise capital, investors don't like to see their money go toward interest,"" said Kevin Inda, a Pocket vice president. The company has had to postpone initial public stock and bond offerings until the market for PCS stocks improve. Analysts foresee a shakeout in the industry as a host of new players engage in a city-by-city battle for market share with established cellular providers typically owned by big regional Baby Bell companies and long-distance carriers. Pocket's bankruptcy filing is expected to send a shudder through the ranks of the other auction winners who are trying to drum up money from wary investors. ""Pocket was a respected company that was considered to have put together a sensible plan,"" said Edward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine. ""It won't make financing more available."" Pocket said it has about $1 billion in assets, largely the value of its licenses, and about $1.5 billion in liabilities. The latter is largely the long-term debt owed to the FCC. The company's 43 licenses cover 35 million potential U.S. customers in markets such as Chicago, Detroit, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, New Orleans, Las Vegas and Honolulu. Pocket's financing plans had hinged on an initial public offering planned for last fall. It was postponed because of delays in the FCC auction process, said Riker. A second shot at an IPO in January fell apart when Wall Street soured on initial offerings in the wireless sector.

The story of an ageing bachelor's re-awakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 ""Velvet Revolution"" -- it is favoured to win an Academy Award this month, after picking up Hollywood's Golden Globe in January. Critics say the politically-charged comedy/drama, which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech new wave of the 1960s. FIRST OSCAR NOMINATION IN 1992 The Sverak team made their first splash in 1992, when the post-war boys'-life drama-comedy ""Elementary School"" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost. ""When we had our first Oscar nomination we thought it would be the first and last time in our lives,"" says Jan. Jan says he met an American scriptwriter in Hollywood four years ago who had been nominated 15 times but had never won an Oscar. ""He is my example,"" Zdenek jumps in to say. While ""Kolya"" is set at the end of the communist era, it is again a mix of personal and political turmoil, seen often through a boy's eyes. The two Sveraks have a close father-son relationship, frequently boyishly embracing in a country where ""macho"" usually means never hugging or shedding a tear. ""We are more friends than a father and son. We are very close characters. He has the same sense of humour as me, and we cry in the same part of the films,"" Zdenek says, His son butts in to warn, ""They think we cry every time we watch the film."" Awkward moments can sometimes occur when the son directs the father in love scenes. In one shot, Zdenek revels in a post-amorous glow with the actress Libuse Safrankova, a woman Jan remembers most for her popular roles as a princess in many Czech fairytales. ""The script says they just finished making love and I have to explain to them that they have to breathe a bit, that they just can't lay there like they are resting... and they have to touch each other... this is bizarre,"" Jan says. ""Yes, bizarre,"" echoes his father. After landing a deal with Miramax to distribute ""Kolya"" the Sveraks are working on an original English-language feature. The project is still a secret, while Zdenek finishes the script. After a film, television, and stage career which has made him one of the most popular personalities in the country since the early 1970s, Zdenek says he has no regrets that he did not defect to pursue his career like so many Czechs including Oscar-winning director Milos Forman. Jan, who came of age as a director after the revolution, says he will stay in Prague, despite offers to go abroad. ""This is the big advantage that we did not receive the Oscar for 'Elementary School' because I was so young and so hungry for American films... Now, I am not hungry any more, so we will make the European films,"" he says. ""There is no political reason to leave the country now and there are possibilities to make films in Europe, so why leave the country?"" But can the Sveraks' magic translate into English-language success? ""Kolya"" has been selling out art houses in New York and on the west coast, but does everyone get it? ""I think that you can get 100 percent of the meaning of 'Kolya', not 100 percent of the jokes,"" Jan says. ""I think the audience can catch the whole message, and not all the jokes unfortunately... But the political background and our geographic situation, that's part of this message...,"" Zdenek replies. ","JohnMastrini"
"Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party on Thursday welcomed a pledge from the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, that people would keep their basic freedoms after China takes over on July 1. But some activists staged a noisy protest disrupting a meeting staged by Tung's aides to tap the public's views on his controversial plan to whittle down civil liberties. A new opinion poll, meanwhile, indicated nine in 10 of Hong Kong students do not believe China will really allow the territory its promised autonomy after Britain hands it back. Fears have been rising in Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years and now with 6.4 million people, that the territory will suffer a loss of freedom after the handover. Tung, set to become Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader, on Wednesday vigorously defended proposed curbs on the right to demonstrate and on foreign funding of political groups, saying laws in the United States were much tougher. ""The majority of cities in North America, including New York, Washington and San Francisco, all require police permission before demonstrations can be held,"" he said. ""Let me assure you the (future) government has the strongest determination to preserve the freedoms that the people of Hong Kong currently enjoy,"" Tung said in a dinner speech. ""Peaceful and lawful demonstrations can and must be allowed to continue. I see public demonstration as a way for people to express their views, and public demonstrations are now a part of Hong Kong culture,"" he said. Anthony Cheung, vice president of the Democratic Party, which believes China would like to snuff out democracy in Hong Kong, cautiously welcomed Tung's assurances, the first public comment Tung has made on the proposals launched last week. ""We welcome this pledge that the right to protest, the right to demonstrate, the freedom of assembly and association, all of these are people's rights and should be part of Hong Kong's political culture,"" Cheung told Hong Kong radio. ""But we question a lot of the substance of Mr Tung's proposals on how to amend the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance,"" he said. ""Some of these proposals have in fact infringed the rights that Mr Tung was talking about."" About 16 pro-democracy councillors waved banners and shouted slogans, disrupting a public consultation on the plan at Hong Kong's Space Museum on Thursday. They then walked out of the meeting, attended by 50 members of local councils. ""We believe this is a fake consultation,"" said councillor Ng Wing-fai. ""The members of the future government already have a basic line and the basic principles will not be changed."" Colonial Governor Chris Patten made clear on Wednesday that Britain would not back down on an issue at the heart of handover quarrels with China -- a shadow legislature that China has appointed to replace the current, elected Legislative Council. Patten opposed calls to allow the China-appointed body to pass a law on residency rights before the hand-back to China. ""That is our position, our position is not going to change."" His comment followed a row this week after China announced rules on who would qualify for ""right of abode"" -- permanent residency -- in Hong Kong after the handover. Beijing plans to submit the bill before June 30 to its Hong Kong provisional legislature. The government said if the bill were to be handled before July 1 by the interim body it would be legally challenged. ","PeterHumphrey"
"While Bre-X Minerals Ltd's maverick chief executive and senior geologist were crowned Canada's top prospectors in March, a major Busang partner got its first inkling that the gold find of century was bust. The big U.S. mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc pulled out of the now worthless Busang gold project on Monday after a damning consultant's report concluded Busang was the biggest fraud in mining history. New Orleans-based Freeport said the report confirmed its own poor test results from the site. Freeport chief executive Jim Bob Moffett said on Monday the first sign that something was wrong at Busang came when its assay lab -- PT Indo Assay Laboratories in Balikpapan, Indonesia -- could not find significant amounts of gold in Freeport's samples. ""We had a preliminary indication from the Indo Assay labs that the samples were not checking out,"" Moffett said in a conference call with reporters on Monday. Moffett said he tried to contact Bre-X Minerals Chief Executive David Walsh and the company's Chief of Exploration, John Felderhof. Both were in Toronto in mid-March to receive awards from their peers at a gala ceremony hosted by the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada. Bre-X's chief geologist, Michael de Guzman, also attended the conference in Toronto. The Busang discovery  -- touted by Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining,"" according to a report issued late on Sunday by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. ""I notified them that they needed to get some senior people back out (to Indonesia) because we needed some help to try to understand what was going on,"" Moffett said. De Guzman was en route to a meeting with Freeport officials in Borneo on March 19 when he allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter. Rumors began to swirl around the Busang project after de Guzman's death. ""Mr. de Guzman was aware that there were problems with the assays. I don't know how much detail he was told,"" Moffett said. About a week after de Guzman's death as rumors about Freeport's findings pounded Bre-X's stock, the Toronto Stock Exchange asked Freeport to issue a statement. Freeport stunned investors on March 26 when the company said its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold. Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona to audit the project. The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares on March 27, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11). In its report, Strathcona said it found evidence of tampering with Bre-X's core samples and that Strathcona's own tests discovered only trace amounts of gold at the Busang site where Bre-X claimed to have found 71 million ounces of gold. The report said a gold deposit worth mining was unlikely to be found at the site. Moffett said Bre-X's warehouse near the Borneo town of Samarinda was the most likely spot for any tampering of Bre-X's core samples. ""We felt that way because those samples sat there for such a long period of time before they actually went to lab in Balikpapan,"" Moffett said. ""It appeared to us that the samples that went to Samarinda ended up with gold in them. The ones that didn't go to Samarinda ended up with no gold in them,"" he said. Moffett said the theory about tampering at Samarinda is outlined in the full interim Strathcona report which will be released publicly on Tuesday. He said it is up to authorities to discover who exactly tampered with Bre-X's samples. Despite the fallout from the Busang debacle, Moffett said prospects for mining investment remain strong in Indonesia, where it has major operations. ""I have a lot of confidence that there is going to be other gold and copper found in the Pacific Rim, especially in the rest of Indonesia and into the Phillippines,"" he said. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"Singapore's Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan said on Thursday that APEC members must strike a balance between liberalising their telecommunications market and maintaining local control. ""One of the things we are discussing, what are the benefits of liberalisation, as opposed to the need to protect local companies from being swamped,"" Mah said after addressing Asia Pacific Economic Coooperation (APEC) forum telecommunications ministers here. ""The benefits of liberalisation are clear, but also we need to balance that benefit with making sure that it is not just foreign companies that make all the profits,"" Mah told Reuters in an interview. ""So that is part of the bargaining, of discussions, that is taking place in this meeting,"" said Mah, who has offered to hold the next meeting of APEC's telecommunication and information technology ministers in Singapore in mid-1998. Mah said there were massive investment requirements in the infrastructure of the region's telecommunications industry, with most of this investment likely to come from the private sector. ""In dollar amounts there is a lot of money to be invested, but the question is, who gets to take part in that investment,"" said Mah, who will be in talks with other APEC telecommunications ministers until Friday. ""If you take everybody into account there are a lot of investment opportunities and this is one of the areas of potential, not just for our (Singapore) companies but for companies in other countries like America, Canada, Australia and Japan,"" Mah said. In May, Mah brought forward Singapore's plans to end the local telephone monopoly by state-controlled Singapore Telecom to the year 2000 from 2007. However, Singapore plans to open its cellular phone market to competition next year. Last month, Mah also announced a further sell-down of Singapore Telecom, which will leave the government owning 75 percent of the telephone carrier.

"British pay television giant BSkyB Plc, a key part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp international media empire, on Thursday staked its claim to a lead role in the development of digital television in the UK. ""Our clear and unambiguous aim is to be in the vanguard of the digital era,"" BSkyB deputy managing director David Chance told a Financial Times conference on New Media and Broadcasting. BSkyB, the leading force in British pay television with some 5.5 million subscribers, plans to launch 200-channel digital satellite services into the UK later this year. BSkyB, one of the corporate success stories of the 1990s in Britain, is 40 percent owned by Murdoch's News Corp. Murdoch this week threw down the gauntlet to U.S. cable companies when News Corp sealed an alliance with EchoStar Communications Corp to offer satellite services to compete with the cable providers. The venture, expected to operate under the American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB) name, will offer as many as 500 channels of digital TV, Internet services and local broadcast TV signals to markets across the United States. News Corp also has important satellite television operations in Asia, such as Star TV and JSkyB, a joint venture in Japan which is expected to begin full service next year. Back in Britain, BSkyB is also seeking to expand into digital terrestrial television (DTT). It has joined forces with UK commercial television giants Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc to apply for licences to run DTT services. Their British Digital Broadcasting consortium faces competition from DTN, owned by Nasdaq-listed cable company International CableTel, for three key DTT licences. Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) is expected to announce a decision on the licences around May. DTT, broadcast from land-based transmitters to standard television aerials, is expected to begin in mid-1998 and offer a total of around 30 channels. Chance said that he hoped that neither UK nor European regulators would oppose British Digital Broadcasting if it were awarded the DTT licences. ""Eight years ago we led Europe in multi-channel TV,"" Chance said. ""We are probably the last in Europe to launch a digital platform...It isn't the time for a handbrake to be applied."" ""We are behind and we need to get on with it."" Digital television offers extra channels, improved sound and picture quality and the potential to access interactive services such as home shopping and home banking. A digital set-top box or decoder is required to view digital channels and a rooftop dish is required to pick up the satellite version. Cable companies are also planning a move to digital. Digital take-up has been slow in a number of countries, notably in Germany, Europe's largest television market. Chance said that for digital to succeed it must offer attractive programming at affordable prices and be simple for viewers to understand and use. ($1=.6146 Pound) ","KeithWeir"
"ConAgra Inc said Tuesday its spread of operations across the food chain -- from seed distribution to meat processing and frozen foods -- is a positive for the company that outweighs its exposure to the commodity markets. ""I see it as a great positive,"" ConAgra Chairman Philip Fletcher said in an interview Tuesday. ConAgra was among the food companies presenting at an analyst conference here.   In the past, ConAgra has faced some criticism for having commodity-sensitive operations that could be a drag on its value-added foods such as its $1.5 billion Healthy Choice line. ""As you look around the globe with the doubling of the population by 2030, they aren't going to be buying frozen foods in a lot of those markets,"" Fletcher said. ""But they sure...are going to be buying a lot of chicken, hogs and...grain (products)...I see the front end of the chain providing us, frankly, a lot more opportunity for the next five or so years than the back end of the chain.""   Across its scope of food operations, ConAgra continues to seek out acquisitions that typically contribute about one-third of its earnings growth over time, Bruce Rohde, vice chairman, added. ""Every year we do a dozen or so (acquisitions),"" he said. Fletcher said acquisitions are scouted out by top executives at its various operating divisions, who must then ""sell"" the idea to the corporation. ""We think the acquisition process is one of our strengths,"" Fletcher added.   Beyond acquisitions, ConAgra continues to grow by new product introductions, particularly in its grocery products division. In the first half of fiscal 1997, ConAgra's grocery products posted a 26 percent rise in operating profits. ""The key driver these days is to make our food much more easy to prepare,"" David Gustin, president of ConAgra Grocery Products, said. While studies indicate a desire to eat more at home, consumers continue to shy away from traditional cooking. ""This requires a drastic change in our attitude toward what the definition of convenience is,"" Gustin said. For many consumers, he added, this means meal preparation times of five to 10 minutes. ConAgra's new products aimed at greater convenience include its Butterball-brand baked chicken and Healthy Choice Hearty Handfuls microwaveable stuffed sandwiches. Other new products being launched by ConAgra include a line of popcorn snack cakes under its Orville Redenbacher's brand. ((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787)) ","PatriciaCommins"
"China said on Sunday it will tighten inspections of imported animals and plants next year for possible diseases after Chinese quarantine officials banned poultry imports from several U.S. states and a part of Britain. ""The country's animal and quarantine authorities will carry out stricter inspection on a wide range of goods,"" the China Daily Business Weekly newspaper said. Inspections would cover imports and exports of plants, animals, fruit and agricultural goods, as well as containers, packages and other materials used to transport them, according to new regulations approved this month by the State Council, or cabinet. Quarantine and customs officials would inspect both hand-carried items as well as goods imported or exported by traders, the newspaper said. Pets and plants of diplomats who have diplomatic immunity would also have to be inspected, it said. The authorities could slap fines of up to 50,000 yuan ($6,000) on violators, the newspaper said. Agricultural officials would be on the lookout for animal and plant diseases at home and abroad, it said. Last week, China announced a ban on poultry imports from Missouri and Oklahoma, alleging that five cases of Newcastle disease were discovered in the two U.S. states between July and September. The United States denied the accusation and said it sought talks with China to lift the ban. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said the disease broke out in pet birds only, and that all the pet birds infected with the disease were destroyed. The spokeswoman said she had no information on which U.S. states found pet birds with Newcastle disease or when the problems were discovered. The newspaper said China banned in July poultry imports from an unidentified area of Britain it believed was affected by Newcastle disease. In October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza. But the ban did not go into effect after China and the United States held talks on the issue. China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products. Some 330,000 tonnes of U.S. poultry products -- worth $445 million -- were exported to China through Hong Kong last year, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council. Every day, 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China, the council said. Beijing and Washington are also at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector. China had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China. Beijing said it was delaying by one month the implementation of those curbs, which had been scheduled to take effect December 10, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.

"The lower house of the Czech parliament ended four days of acrimonious debate on Friday by approving a post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany already signed by both governments. The parliamentary statement of approval for the declaration -- which includes a separate clause implying, in part, that post-war property restitution questions against the Czechs are closed --  was carried by 131 votes to 59. Germany's parliament had already approved the declaration in January by a large majority. The Czech debate over the sensitive agreement turned ugly at times amid stalling tactics by ultra-right Republican and Communist opposition deputies who see the pact as a sellout to Bonn, and who were trying to obstruct a final vote. Approval of the declaration, expected to pass easily in the Czech upper house, is seen by the Prague government as a prerequisite for NATO and EU membership. The pact also seals Germany's final post-war reconciliation with a neighbouring country. The agreement expresses Bonn's regrets for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands, and Prague's sorrow for Czech brutality in the post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans. While the bilateral agreement sets up a fund for general victim compensation programmes, it does not directly deal with the thorny issue of restitution to expropriated ethnic Germans. Instead it says the issue should never again become a political consideration. The parliamentary preamble approved with the declaration makes reference to speeches by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec introducing the measure this week in which both insist that post-war property restitution questions are closed. Bonn insisted after the agreement was signed that individual property claims can still be made, but Klaus and Zieleniec both rejected this. The largest opposition party, the Social Democrats (CSSD), demanded that references to the introductory speeches by Klaus and Zieleniec be included in the preamble -- especially because of their comments on property issues -- to ensure a large majority in favour of the declaration. The preamble says simply that parliament, ""after listening to the prime minister... and foreign minister, and on the basis of the government's reasoning"", agrees with the declaration ""which expresses the will of both states to prevent the past from troubling the joint European future."" Zieleniec said after the vote (corrects from ""after the speech"") that the preamble, which may raise eyebrows in southern Germany where most of the expellees now live, was not aimed at any specific issue, despite the CSSD's protests. ""It is a formulation which does not interpret the declaration nor does it stress any of its parts above others,"" Zieleniec said. Top German politicians had cautioned the Czech parliament not to reinterpret the pact, which took nearly two years to negotiate. ","JanLopatka"
"Marking another step in the consolidation of the automotive interior parts industry, Canada's Magna International Inc. said Thursday it will acquire seat maker Douglas &amp; Lomason Co. for about $135 million in cash. Under the deal, Magna made a $31-a-share tender offer for all of Douglas &amp; Lomason's 4.45 million common shares outstanding, which include some managment stock options to be bought at lower option prices. Douglas &amp; Lomason shares rose 37.5 cents to $26.125 on Nasdaq prior to the merger announcement. The acquisition will beef-up Markham, Ontario-based Magna's North American car and truck seating business, allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc. and Lear Corp.. Family-controlled Douglas &amp; Lomason, which had 1995 revenues of $561 million, was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from automakers, said James Hoey, chief financial officer. ""Unfortunately, in the auto industry these days, a $500 million company is not a big company any more,"" Hoey said. ""This merger makes us much more competitive."" Douglas &amp; Lomason's profits have been hurt in the past year by model changeovers that had limited production at some key customers, but were recovering, analysts said. The company earned $11.2 million on sales of $299 million in the first six months of 1996, up from year-earlier earnings of $4.7 million on sales of $285.7 million. Some analysts said the deal was encouraged by Ford Motor Co. because it wanted Magna to become a stronger competitor to Lear and Johnson Controls, its principal seat suppliers. Douglas &amp; Lomason currently supplies seats for the Ford Contour and Mystique cars and other models, while Magna's only major seat contract is for Chrysler Corp.'s minivans. A Ford spokesman said the automaker did not take an active role in encouraging the merger, but he added that Ford was pleased with the deal. Ford plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers -- those it deals with directly -- in half over the next five years. ""The deal really levels the seating field somewhat,"" said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim &amp; Co. ""It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market."" Magna's traditional strength has been instrument panels, door panels and other interior components. Magna, Johnson Controls and Lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers, including seats, instrument panels, door panels and carpeting. Johnson Controls Inc. last month agreed to acquire Holland, Mich.-base Prince Automotive for $1.35 billion in cash to build up its non-seating capabilities. Lear also has made several acquisitions in the past year to add to its capabilities. ","DavidLawder"
"China appealed for calm while South Korea called for a military alert amid fears a diplomatic deadlock over a senior Pyongyang defector marooned in Beijing could push the hermit North to take extreme action. However, signs emerged that North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-il might be ready to give up the fight to recover scholarly ideologue Hwang Jang-yop -- possibly as a result of mediation by Beijing to end the Cold War crisis in its backyard. South Korean officials said talks continued with Beijing over the fate of Hwang, ranked 24th in Pyongyang's hierarchy, who spent his seventh day behind the white walls of Seoul's consulate office in Beijing. Hwang could be the first in a stream of high-level defectors to betray their Stalinist homeland, beset by two years of floods, food shortages and talk of power struggles, South Korean media reported in Seoul. South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung called for ""extraordinary alertness"" and military readiness against North Korea, saying Hwang's defection had sent shock waves through the divided Korean peninsula. A Seoul newspaper said it had documents revealing plans by other North Korean officials to flee. ""The defection of secretary Hwang Jang-yop, who belongs to the core force of the North Korean leadership, vividly displays the shaking of the ideological foundation that has supported the North Korean system amid economic disasters,"" Lee said. Seoul would spare no diplomatic efforts to allow Hwang to be granted political asylum, he said. Lee told parliament that Pyongyang had increasingly deployed offensive forces near the border with the South, despite an economic crisis and chronic food shortages. A military spokesman said Lee was referring to the North's defence build-up in recent years and no additional troops had been deployed at the tense border in the past week. But China took no chances and sent three armoured personnel carriers to reinforce approaches to Seoul's mission, apparently not reassured by signs Pyongyang could be coming to terms with the loss of one of its greatest ideological thinkers. The softer tone set when Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said it would dismiss Hwang if he defected was echoed by supreme leader Kim, who said those who lacked the grit to defend Pyongyang's fiery brand of communism should go their own way. ""As the revolutionary song goes: Cowards, Leave If You Want To! We will defend the red flag to the bitter end,"" a political essay broadcast by state radio quoted Kim as saying. Pyongyang officials had previously been steadfast in their accusation that Seoul abducted the architect of North Korea's governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance. South Korea has dismissed the charge as preposterous. North Korea's ambassador met Chinese Foreign Ministry officials in talks that apparently resulted in Pyongyang's change in tune and withdrawal of diplomats from a vigil outside the mission where Hwang is marooned, Western diplomats said. Beijing, an unwilling third party in the feuding between the two hostile sides in the last Cold War standoff, repeated its plea to both to act with restraint to resolve the affair. The United States has urged Pyongyang to avoid all provocative actions and has said it was closely monitoring developments after an assassination attempt against a former North Korean defector near Seoul on Saturday night. The tussle over Hwang's defection was the latest flare-up in tense relations between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 Korean civil war ended only in a truce. ","JaneMacartney"
"The world's biggest miner, RTZ-CRA, announced a major realignment of its sprawling empire on Wednesday and removed any doubt that London was its capital. The group, born of a 1995 merger of London-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd, said it would now manage its global businesses along six main product lines. These were aluminium, copper, energy, industrial minerals, iron ore, and gold and other minerals. Together they reaped revenues of around US$8 billion for the group in calendar 1996 from operations on all six continents. RTZ-CRA said it would shrink its Melbourne office, CRA's home base and until now the group's ""other"" headquarters. It will halve the staff there, shedding 100 jobs, and leave the office with a support role only. CRA chairman John Uhrig said in outlining the changes that the merger, which maintained the two firms' separate listings, had so far not produced a better outcome for shareholders. ""It would have been surprising if it had in its first year of operation,"" Uhrig told a news conference in Melbourne. The restructuring leaves Australian-based executives to manage the aluminium, energy and iron ore businesses from Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. London handles the rest and remains the sole group headquarters. The Salt Lake City office of its Kennecott copper operation in the United States as well as the group's Johannesburg office would be closed, it added. The new structure shifts the focus of management away from a geographical view of the world, where operations differ by country, toward a single management for each global business. It ensures RTZ-CRA does not become an unwieldy bureaucracy unable to compete with more nimble rivals which deal in just one commodity, the group said. Chief executive Leon Davis gave examples where, under the current structure, copper operations and coal mines were under several different leaderships across the globe. ""These are barriers that are artificially created and we are intent on removing them,"" Davis told the news conference. ""It will eliminate duplication, lower our costs and improve our efficiency,"" he added. Mining analysts welcomed the move. One viewed it as confirmation the RTZ-CRA marriage, made without any shares actually changing hands, was effectively a cheap buy-out of CRA. ""If anyone thought the DLC (dual-listed structure) was anything other than a buy-out on the cheap, they should assess this little move because they are virtually wiping out Melbourne head office,"" a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters. The analyst said he expected the group to eventually transform the dual-listed structure into the one company. RTZ-CRA has already proposed to ditch its double-barrelled name and become known, subject to shareholder approval this year, as Rio Tinto. RTZ's shares would then trade in London as Rio Tinto Plc and CRA's stock in Australia as Rio Tinto Ltd. A Melbourne-based analyst said the cementing of London as the group's headquarters came as no surprise. ""It doesn't make any sense to have two head offices,"" he said. ","MarkBendeich"
"Colombia's lower house of Congress on Wednesday approved a law that will almost triple maximum jail terms for drug traffickers. The bill, passed unanimously without debate, was approved by the Senate late on Tuesday and is set to be put on the statute books after presidential signature by next week. The vote is likely to please the United States, which is due to announce shortly whether it will again blacklist Colombia for failing to crack down hard enough on drug trafficking. The legislation effectively eliminates what the U.S. government has termed Colombia's ""lax"" anti-narcotics laws and raises the maximum jail term for drug-related crimes to 60 years from the current maximum of 24. ""We have just approved the toughest anti-drug penalties in Colombian history. Those taffickers who continue committing crimes from jail now see that we have got serious,"" legislator Roy Barreras told Congress. He denounced U.S. pressure to rush the law through Congress and urged fellow politicians not to debate a new bill to overturn Colombia's five-year ban on extradition until the annual U.S. decision on so-called ""certification"" is known.

"Britain's Courtaulds Textiles Plc on Tuesday reported a first-half loss after one-off charges and said that most of the 30 to 35 million pounds it plans to spend on restructuring will fall in the second half of 1996. Courtaulds made a pre-tax loss after exceptional charges of 8.5 million pounds ($13.26 million) compared with profit of 6.4 million in the first half last year. Excluding exceptional charges, pre-tax profit fell to 600,000 pounds from 10.3 million. In a telephone interview with Reuters, the group's new chief executive, Colin Dyer, said his aim is to move ahead quickly on reorganisation, which includes further disposals and creation of four product-led divisions, and get back to a ""clean set of results."" The decline in profits was mainly in its fabrics division and resulted from weak demand in the U.S. and in continental European for lace, as well as reorganisation costs in Britain. Dyer said the company is to shed jobs in Britain and western Europe and increase production in low wage economies, especially in Asia. ""The most important thing is that we are attacking our problems and putting them right quickly,"" Dyer said. Reorganisation into four clear divisions will allow Courtaulds Textiles to focus on its strengths and relieve managers of the burden of ""firefighting,"" Dyer said. Courtaulds has sold around half its hit list of a dozen problem businesses, with three disposals announced last week. Dyer said in total the disposals will account for 160 million pounds of turnover, and those so far announced ""must be getting towrds half."" Talks on ""one or two"" remaining sales are ""quite advanced,"" he added. Courtaulds took a 9.1 million stg restructuring charge in the six months to June, and expects to generate cost-savings of 10 to 13 million pounds a year by 1998. Dyer said benefits ""will be kicking in a bit this year, but significantly in 1998."" He declined to give exact forecasts for 1996 as a whole, but added that analysts' profit forecasts ""are not far away on the full year."" Analysts are predicting full-year pre-tax profit of between 34.0 and 40.6 million stg before exceptional items. He also would not be drawn on whether the company will be able to continue to maintain its dividend. ""We will take that half by half,"" he said. It held its interim dividend at 5.2p. Dyer also signaled the group's intention of ""moving the cost base from Britain and western Europe to lower cost manufacturing"" and warned that opposition Labour Party plans to introduce a minimum wage in Britain would make matters worse. ""There will be job losses,"" Dyer said, but would not give further details. Courtaulds currently has operations in Britain, France, Germany and Spain, as well as Morocco and Turkey. Dyer said the Far East offers clear advantages in terms of labour costs and access to raw materials. The group already operates in the Philippines and Thailand, where it makes stretch fabrics. Turning to individual markets, Dyer said the U.S. is ""a mixed bag,"" with fabrics ""very strong"" but lace ""bumping along the bottom"". ""Britain is quite strong. All you read in the press about the feelgood factor is right,"" he said. ""The European scene is mixed. Germany and Italy are still poor but lace is showing signs of recovery in the second half,"" Dyer said, adding that ""France is the deadest"" market, with consumer spending flat.

"China's resounding declaration of support for the Hong Kong dollar makes a successful assault on the currency even more unlikely, foreign exchange experts said on Wednesday. ""The only way you're going to get a remote chance of a successful speculative attack is if there is such a crisis of confidence it begins to affect retail bank deposits. Otherwise, I just don't see it,"" said Jim Rohwer, Asian emerging markets strategist for C.S. First Boston in Hong Kong. Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, reiterated at a Bank of England seminar in London on Tuesday that Beijing stands ready to defend the Hong Kong dollar from attack if need be. ""We are prepared to offer liquidity support to the (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) for the purpose of stabilising the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar,"" Chen said. ""We also stand ready to use our foreign reserves to support the Hong Kong dollar, if necessary."" The Hong Kong dollar peg was set in 1983 at HK$7.80 to the US dollar when jitters connected to the 1997 handover sent it into a tailspin. The peg still remains Hong Kong's first line of defence against economic instability associated with the handover at midnight on June 30 next year. The peg has an impressive track record. It withstood the fallout from the Tiananmen massacre in June 1989, when the Hong Kong stock market plunged, and also the global stock market crash of 1987. ""Nineteen ninety-seven is just a date on the calendar at this point,"" said one currency trader. ""There is no uncertainty. You're either here or you're not here. It won't be Independence Day. There are no aliens."" An opportunistic attack upon the currency in January 1995 was quickly warded off by Hong Kong's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which immediately raised interest rates to punishing levels. Experts said a speculative assault upon the currency would almost certainly be doomed given Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves of around US$60 billion. As well as access to China's reserves of $90 billion, Hong Kong has repurchase agreements with several Asian nations that hoard U.S. dollars, partly to protect relatively fragile and export-dependent economies. Such a deep war chest is a formidable deterrent to all but the richest and most determined of speculators. ""The only thing that can break the peg at this point is political instability that causes capital outflows,"" another trader said. But the extent of the political unrest would have to be extraordinary, given the Hong Kong dollar's immunity to the political instability in Beijing in June 1989. ""It would have to be a real debacle. You have to imagine something much, much worse than Tiananmen,"" said Bill Overholt, director of research at Bankers Trust in Hong Kong. Hong Kong does not have sufficient reserves to defend a sustained run on the territory's banking deposits, but there are few signs so far that retail investors are concerned. Rohwer said that confidence appears to be improving with the Hong Kong dollar moving at the stronger end of its trading band. Also, the proportion of banking deposits held in foreign currency is falling, reaching 45 percent at the end of the April this year compared to 54 percent in 1991. ","SarahDavison"
"Crucial talks between Hong Kong and Taiwan on how to continue direct shipping links after the British-ruled territory reverts to China foundered on Friday when the two sides hit an impasse over which flags to fly. The one-day talks, aimed at resolving sensitive details of shipping protocol, hit a major snag when the two sides failed to agree on which flags ships should fly when plying routes between Hong Kong and Taiwan, the Taiwanese representative said. ""The obstacle is the flag. This is a contentious issue,"" deputy secretary-general Chang Liang-jen of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation said at a news conference. ""It's a very complicated matter and a difficult one to settle just in one meeting,"" Chang said at the end of the talks. Ships registered in Hong Kong and Taiwan currently follow the international practice of flying each other's flag when entering the other's territorial waters. But this practice must be abandoned after Britain hands back Hong Kong to China on July 1, as the territory's post-handover constitution has a clause saying it must observe the ""one-China"" principle. Communist-ruled China has viewed Taiwan as a rebel province since the Nationalist government fled to the island after losing a Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing fiercely opposes any symbol or gesture of Taiwan independence. As a result, Hong Kong ships will not be allowed to fly the Taiwan flag. Taipei wants Taiwan and Hong Kong ships to lower all flags and identify themselves by telex before entering each other's waters, but Hong Kong is against the idea. ""Every ship in the world has to fly a flag according to international maritime laws. Only a pirate's ship is without a flag,"" said George Chao, head of the Hong Kong Shipowners' Association. Chao, who held a separate news conference after Chang left, admitted he was constrained by guidelines given by China. ""Beijing has given me the 'one-China' principle within which to operate,"" he said, adding that although the meeting had not nailed down an agreement, it had ruled out some options. ""Both sides have agreed the Chinese flag and the Taiwanese flag will not be flown,"" he said. But he refused to say whether Hong Kong's future flag, depicting the tropical bauhinia flower, or Taiwan's unofficial plum blossom flag used in international sport gatherings and other events were options under consideration. ""Until we agree, I will not disclose our plan,"" he said. China, which has kept conspicuously silent on the issue, is keenly interested and monitoring it closely. A China-backed Hong Kong newspaper said on Friday that the continuation of shipping links between Hong Kong and Taiwan after July 1 must abide by the ""one-China"" principle. ""Carrying the Taiwan national flag is in conflict with the one-China policy,"" Wen Wei Pao said. But the newspaper offered a solution. ""The problem was solved for air traffic when China Airlines replaced the Taiwan flag on its logo with the plum blossom. It should not be too hard for sea traffic to do something similar,"" it said. Chao said he was confident a decision would be reached before July 1. The two sides will hold their second meeting in Taipei, probably in two weeks' time, he added. ","TanEeLyn"
"David Walsh, the maverick Canadian bankrupt turned gold prospector now embroiled in a worldwide mining controversy, always dreamed of striking it rich. Walsh, 51, has made millions of dollars and appeared on the covers of national magazines since his exploration company, Bre-X Minerals Ltd., made its fabulous Busang gold discovery in Indonesia. ""I'm nuts. I'm looking for the bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow,"" the beefy stock promoter who lives in the Bahamas, told a Canadian magazine recently. The bubble burst on Wednesday when Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X admitted that the find in Indonesia once thought to be the richest this century, might not even be economically viable. ""I would really be shocked if we find out that there is any funny business,"" said Jim Bentein, a veteran Calgary journalist who has covered Walsh since Bre-X's early days as a penny stock on the Alberta Stock Exchange. He described Walsh as ""a sophisticated trucker,"" who is as comfortable having a beer and a smoke in a bar as he is in financial circles. ""Don't misunderstand me. This is a sharpy. This is a guy who has been a broker and tried to run up penny stocks before. We're not talking about a babe in the woods here, but he strikes me as a straight shooter,"" Bentein said in a telephone interview. As regulators sifted through the tangled Busang saga and jittery shareholders dumped the stock, Walsh defended the company's claims on Thursday and urged shareholders to ride out the storm. ""Like all the other trials and tribulations that we've gone through since discovering (Busang)...we'll be exonerated and the property will stand as we've indicated,"" he told reporters outside the company's head office in a toney section of Calgary. Walsh rose from rags to riches in less than four years. Raised in a wealthy suburb of Montreal, Walsh followed his father and grandfather into the stock business. He joined a small trust company shortly after graduating from high school. In 1976, he moved to brokerage Midland Doherty Ltd. (now Midland Walwyn Capital Inc.) and rose to vice-president in its institutional equity sales department. In the 1980s, Midland moved Walsh to Calgary, but he left the company shortly afterward to set up his own company, Bresea Resources Ltd. After dabbling unsuccessfully in oil and gas, Walsh created Bre-X Minerals Ltd in 1989 and ventured into mining. But by 1993, his exploration efforts had dried up. He and his wife declared bankruptcy in 1993 after they had accumulated almost C$60,000 ($43,800) in debt on 15 credit cards. ""We had these claims which were worthless, and no money,"" Walsh told Reuters in an interview earlier this year. Almost broke, he scraped together C$10,000 ($7,300) to start exploring in Indonesia, pursuading friends to invest C$200,000 ($146,000) for a stake in the area now known as the central Busang in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province. Walsh hit the jackpot with Busang and Bre-X quickly became the darling of the world's mining community. ""There's nothing like success. Our other explorations have been zero. I had never imagined it would be this big,"" he said. Walsh, his wife and other company officials added more than C$37 million ($27 million) to their bank accounts after they sold Bre-X shares at prices ranging from C$24.40 to C$28.40 between August and October. But the sales were controversial because they occurred shortly after Bre-X learned that its preliminary license had been canceled by the Indonesian government, a development Bre-X did not reveal publicly until last October. Last year, Bre-X was the target of an intense bidding war as several heavyweight mining firms battled for control of possibly the world's richest gold discovery. Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp., armed with an advisory board that included former U.S. President George Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, initially dominated the negotiations. Barrick's inside track ended when the government of President Suharto brought in Indonesian businessman Muhammad ""Bob"" Hasan in January. Hasan swiftly brokered a deal that gave New Orleans-based Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. 15 percent of Busang and the right to mine the project. The arrangement left Bre-X with 45 percent, down from an original 90 percent stake, and the rest to the Indonesian government and two Indonesian companies. Investors complained that Bre-X received nothing for surrendering 45 percent of Busang, but Walsh said Bre-X never owned 90 percent and shareholders were wrong to believe so. Shortly afterward, Bre-X's stock started a downward spiral as rumors swirled around the company and its grip on the discovery. The stock sank to an all-time low last week after an Indonesian newspaper report said Freeport had doubts about the size and viability of the deposit. The rumors were fanned to fever pitch by the death, billed as a suicide, of Bre-X chief geologist Michael de Guzman, who fell from a helicopter en route to Busang last Wednesday. Meanwhile, Walsh hinted on Thursday that the chaos engulfing his company may have some other explanation. ""I personally believe there has been a hidden agenda coming up for about 10 months now and I guess we'll just have to play this out,"" he said. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"Members of the Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest mortgage lender, on Monday voted overwhelmingly to convert the mutually-owned financial giant into a public company and float it on the stock exchange. Of the eight million Halifax members eligible to vote, more than 97 percent of both borrowers and investors voted in favour of the conversion. For the investors' resolution to be carried, 50 percent of those eligible to vote needed to do so and of these, 75 percent were needed to vote in favour. The flotation, expected to value the society at some 12 billion pounds ($19.5 billion), is now expected to go ahead in June. Little more than 1,000 of the Halifax's members actually attended Monday's meeting since most mailed in their votes, but many expressed dismay that the society was losing its mutual status. However, they were assured by Halifax chairman Jon Foulds that the conversion to a bank would be in the customers' best interest. ""If we convert to a public limited company (Plc) we will be best placed to fulfil your needs,"" Foulds told the meeting, adding that bank status would give the Halifax better access to the equity and debt capital markets and to wholesale funding from the money markets. But Peter Judge, co-founder of the Halifax Action Group, which has campaigned against the conversion, called on the board to resign over its proposals and had a fierce exchange with Foulds from the floor of the meeting, accusing the board of engaging in a privatisation exercise. Halifax members will get a basic 200 shares which on early estimates would be worth around 1,000 pounds but which, by the time of the flotation is likely to be worth near an average of 1,500 pounds. The conversion proposal has not been without controversy with many Halifax members wanting the society to retain its mutual roots and others complaining about the treatment of some disabled members. Foulds said the board had sympathy for the case of the disabled and other groups whose accounts are held in trust but said the whole flotation could not be put at risk in order to meet their needs. Other groups to have their case put before the meeting included the blind, children, and members living in some countries, like Canada, the United States and Australia, who have been excluded from the share pay-out for technical reasons. The action group vowed to continue its struggle against the conversion, saying that the Halifax transfer document was biased and did not give the arguments against conversion. Halifax vice chairman John Wood denied that its directors would become ""fat cats"". He noted that the directors had waived the right to free shares and that the Halifax had no executive share scheme. Wood said that any future share scheme for directors would have to gain the approval of shareholders. The action group says Halifax members will get less interest on their deposits and pay more for their mortgages than account holders at societies that remain mutual. ""If it were not for the fact that people are being bribed with their own money we believe no one would vote for conversion,"" said the group's co-founder Serge Lourie. Lourie said the action group plans fight its case with the Building Societies Commission, the industry regulator, which will meet in April to approve the conversion before it goes ahead.

"Labour unions at beleaguered French carmaker Renault SA said on Monday that they were calling for a one-hour strike at all Renault plants in France, Belgium and Spain. This was in reaction to an announcement last week that of Renault's Vilvoorde plant near Brussels would close and reports that job will go in France, they said in a statement. Earlier a Renault spokeswoman said chairman Louis Schweitzer had agreed to meet staff this week at the Belgian plant, where 3,100 jobs will go, but the time and place were not set. Last Thursday's surprise announcement by the privatised car firm that it would close Vilvoorde stirred a political storm at home and abroad, and a denunciation from Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. The Renault spokeswoman had no comment on newspaper reports that it was preparing to announce some 3,000 job cuts in France this year. But an industry source said somewhat fewer than 3,000 posts would go in 1997. An official with the CGT union said Schweitzer was also expected to make a rare appearance at a staff works meeting in France on Thursday. ""Schweitzer has let it be known that he'll explain the situation the company finds itself in on Thursday at an extraordinary staff works council meeting,"" the official with the Communist-led CGT, Renault's biggest union, told Reuters. Renault's troubles were highlighted by statistics showing new car sales in France slid 24.6 percent last month after tumbling 33.6 percent in January. The two-month drop reflected the market's weakness since a French state rebate programme, which had underpinned demand, ended in September. Faced with declining demand and gross overcapacity, Renault is being forced to cut production but must do so without French government support. With French unemployment at 12.7 percent and a general election due next year, the centre-right government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe has refused to back a plan to cut 40,000 jobs in the car industry over six years. French radio and newspapers gave blanket coverage to the labour dispute, with Le Figaro newspaper quoting the economy minister for Belgium's Flemish region as saying the closure was ""an act of economic terrorism"". Thousands of workers from Renault Belgium, supported by steelworkers, marched through Brussels to protest against the shutdown which is expected to save 825 million French francs ($144 million) a year. Belgian workers called for a Renault boycott. But on the French stock market, brokers said the company had to reduce output and restructure. Renault stock was down 4.02 percent at 141 francs at 1243 GMT, but that was due to profit-taking as the shares have risen 20 percent since last Wednesday. ""The big problem in the auto sector is overcapacity, a problem which no-one has dared to touch for 20 years for obvious labour reasons,"" said a broker. ""The fact that Renault is tackling it is a good sign."" Renault shed 1,641 jobs last year and 1,735 in 1995. Newspapers said charges for the job-cutting plans, on top of an operating loss at the group estimated at two billion francs or more, would result in a full year loss of more than five billion francs for the group in 1996. The car firm was privatised in stages in 1994 and 1996. Renault has four assembly plants in France, two in Spain, one in Portugal and one in Slovenia. ($ = 5.718 French Francs) ","PierreTran"
"Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is expected to report on Thursday a stagnant net profit for the year to June 30, held back by soaring newsprint costs and losses from its burgeoning Star TV operations, analysts said. The median forecast in BZW's BARCEPS broker survey is for a A$1.343 billion net profit before abnormals for the year, a virtual replica of the A$1.342 billion profit posted in 1994/95. Analysts said News may even struggle to match last year's result, particularly given its lower than expected third quarter result.   ""It's got to be a reasonably strong last quarter to match that (1994/95) figure,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett media analyst John Bell. ""I doubt there'll be many surprises on the upside,"" he said. News posted a A$281 million net profit before abnormals in the third quarter, below expectations of about A$300 million and taking profits for the first nine months of the year to A$944 million. The result is expected around 8.30 a.m. Australian time on Thursday (2230 GMT Wednesday).   Analysts said News' 1995/96 profits had been restrained generally by the higher paper costs, a U.K. cover price war and continued losses from its Star TV operation in Hong Kong. ""People will look at newspapers because that will reflect higher newsprint prices and the impact of the newspaper price war,"" said one Melbourne media analyst. Margins on News' British newspapers were seen pressured in the final few months of the year by cover price discounts ahead of the Olympics. ""There was a little bit of renewed competition on the Monday cover prices pre-Olympics,"" Bell said.   ""Margins may have slipped a little bit in the last few months of the year,"" he said. Star TV was seen pumping out another US$90 million to US$100 million of losses for the year as it establishes itself in the potentially lucrative Asian satellite television markets. ""I would expect a full year loss of US$90 million given what we've been told so far and I've seen nothing to change that,"" the Melbourne analyst said. ""I would see it somewhere in excess of of US$100 million,"" Bell said.   Continued strong earnings from U.S. television and films are seen offsetting somewhat the newsprint and Star TV losses. Looking ahead however, analysts are confident News' profits can start growing again in 1996/97, boosted by potentially lower newsprint prices and an earnings surge from the hit U.S. special effects movie, ""Independence Day"". ""'Independence Day' could add up to US$200 million to the bottom line,"" said Bell, who forecast net profit rising to A$1.5 billion in 1996/97.   ""The 1996/97 result will show some clear profit growth as much as anything because of paper prices and 'Independence Day',"" the Melbourne analyst said, who forecast a A$1.6 billion net profit.

"Canadian grocery chain Loblaw Cos Ltd is set to see earnings per share soar by 50 percent by 2000 as sales grow, President Richard Currie said on Friday. ""Earnings per share will jump about 50 percent over the next three years,"" Currie told the annual meeting. First- quarter profit rose to C$0.15 a share for the period ended March 22 from year earlier C$0.12. Currie also told shareholders that 1997 earnings per share would rise to C$0.85 to C$0.89, the range of predictions by analysts. ""My expectations are (that) the analysts are about correct,"" he said. Last year, Loblaw, which is 70 percent-owned by bakery group George Weston Ltd, earned C$0.72 a share or C$173.7 million on sales of C$9.85 billion. Currie forecast 1997 sales would expand by 10 percent. ""Sales have been very solid, up seven percent last year, and with this year being a 53-week year, it might hit to 10 percent,"" Currie added. ""That would represent a stellar year."" Loblaw ended its previous fiscal year in December 28 but because it reports in 12-week increments, it must add a few days this year. ""The earnings have a potential to increase more if we can get our costs down to where they could be,"" Currie said. In 1996, Loblaw streamlined warehousing and distribution systems. Loblaw, which owns retail and wholesale stores including Loblaws, Valu-Mart, Extra Foods and Lucky Dollar Foods, has seen sales grow steadily over the past few years as it expanded in Atlantic Canada and other regions. The grocer plans to unveil its first Quebec stores, outside of its outlets in the Ottawa/Hull region, in late 1997 or early 1998. Loblaw has also benefited from the strike of unionized workers at 73 Safeway Inc stores in Alberta, which began on March 26, Currie added. Loblaw sales have jumped 30 percent in the province. Safeway is based in Pleasanton, California. Currie said Loblaw would have C$450 million in capital expenditures in 1997, up from about C$350 million in 1996. He said Loblaw planned to open or renovate 64 outlets. Loblaw shares edged up 0.05 to 17.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange today, below its 52-week high of 17.60 and well above its year low of 10.40.

"Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday raided the country's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, in a dramatic sign of a widening probe into its part in payments to a client linked to racketeers. The late afternoon raid on Nomura headquarters in central Tokyo was by both prosecutors and officials of the nation's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC). The highly public raids appeared to signal that the Nomura incident could become a showcase crackdown as Japan seeks to clean up business practices and deregulate its economy. Coinciding with the headquarters raid, 90 officials raided 10 other locations and for the first time formally spelled out in detail what they were investigating. Deputy chief prosecutor Kunihiro Matsuo told reporters the raids were to investigate a Nomura director's illegal payment of 38 million yen ($309,000) to a company run by a relative of a racketeer to avoid disruption of a Nomura annual meeting. Matsuo said the other raids included searches of the homes of the racketeer, or ""sokaiya,"" as well as the Nomura director involved in the scandal, Shimpei Matsuki, and other Nomura executives. Police have said Sokaiya, often linked to ""yakuza"" crime syndicates, extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called ""sokai"" in Japanese. The scandal surfaced on March 6. Matsuki and fellow director Nobutaka Fujikura resigned on March 10 after internal probes found they made discretionary deals banned under Japanese securities law and funnelled profits to a front company for the racketeer. Individuals found to have violated the law would face a fine of up to one million yen ($8,100) and a maximum one-year jail sentence. If the company is found in violation, the fine is up to 100 million yen ($813,000). A government source said that the SESC had decided to search the firm's headquarters while investigations were still under way because of concerns that evidence could be hidden. The company said on Tuesday it regretted the raids but would cooperate with investigators. Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down on March 14 to atone for the scandal. Chairman Masashi Suzuki took over his position while retaining the chairmanship. Nomura, as well as share trading, exerts a powerful influence on every business in the yen bond market and is also Japan's top foreign bond seller. The company has seen key foreign and domestic clients suspend business with it since the scandal broke. Nomura has been a key player in Japanese financial markets for most of this century, including underwriting firms such as Sony Corp, which were part of Japan's postwar economic miracle. In a scene akin to a Japanese film, 90 officials in business suits, led by a man with a briefcase, marched military-style through the front doors of Nomura's modernistic headquarters. They locked the doors, shutting out journalists gathered for a raid designed to have maximum publicity. Reports of the raids hit Nomura's share price, which ended the day down 20 yen (16 cents) at 1,440 yen ($11.70). ""What the market is more concerned about is any punitive measures which will be taken against the brokerage,"" said Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager. ""The punishment will probably have an effect on the firm's business and could have an impact on the whole brokerage industry as well,"" Ueki said. The investigation comes six years after Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients. Top executives at Nomura resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations of deals with gangsters. ($1=123 yen) ","FumikoFujisaki"
"Chrysler Corp., formalising plans to keep President Robert Lutz on its payroll past the age of 65 and develop a new generation of managers, said its board of directors named Lutz vice chairman on Thursday. The board gave Lutz's title of president to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Eaton, who will take on more day-to-day operating duties. The chief operating officer post that Lutz also held was left vacant. Lutz, a former Marine fighter pilot who is credited with pumping new life into Chrysler's product development process and making it the most efficient in the industry, is expected to stay on for two more years, a company spokesman said. Chrysler's board also on Thursday took steps to boost shareholder value by increasing its share buyback programme to $2 billion from $1 billion for 1997, and hiking the annual dividend to $1.60 a share from $1.40. The new quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share is payable Jan. 15 to stockholders of record as of Dec. 15. Chrysler said it has now raised its dividend seven times in the past three years and has increased the payout by 433 percent since September 1993. Thursday's actions come about 10 months after the company settled a bitter fight with Las Vegas billionaire Kirk Kerkorian. Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp., the automaker's largest single shareholder, had mounted a hostile takeover attempt of Chrysler last year, complaining the company was not doing enough to reward shareholders. A Tracinda representative could not be reached for comment Thursday. In its personnel moves, Chrysler switched international and product development duties among two top executives considered to be in line to succeed Eaton some day, Thomas Gale and Francois Castaing. Gale will trade his duties as head of international operations for Castaing's duties as head of engineering and product development. Gale, who becomes executive vice president - product development, will retain his control over product design, while Castaing, who becomes executive vice president - international, will retain his control of powertrain operations. Four other executive vice presidents did not receive job changes. But Chrysler spoksman Arthur Liebler said Gale and Castaing do not have an edge over them to be chosen as Chrysler's next chairman. Lutz, who turns 65 in February, will report to Eaton and will focus primarily on the automaker's product development activities, and will serve as a ""coach, mentor and advisor,"" the company said in a statement. ""As vice chairman, Bob will focus his considerable talents on the product development process ... specifically on making sure we retain our product edge well into the 21st Century,"" Eaton said in a statement. ""He will continue as a member of the Office of the Chairman and as a director of the Company and will continue to be involved in all major decisions,"" Eaton said. Industry analysts said the moves were aimed at allowing Chrysler to continue to take advantage of Lutz' skills while not eliminating any prospective future chairmen. ""They've really kept out of a sort of hysterical concern about where people fit in the organisation -- and that might not be too bad,"" said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Centre for the Study of Automotive Transporation. Cole theorised Chrysler may never hand out the president title to a rising executive, thus allowing its executive vice presidents to concentrate on their current jobs. ""What they're really doing is managing the transition from the old Chrysler to the new one,"" he said. ","DavidLawder"
"The great Internet gold rush may be over, some high-technology industry executives say, but they see a silver lining: continued growth for leading high-tech companies. ""The Internet gold rush is over. We've had this big phenomenon, but there's not a lot of gold there,"" Frank Gill, executive vice president and general manager of Intel Corp.'s Internet and Communications Group, said in an interview on the eve of Wednesday's Spring Internet World 97 conference. Gill is one of five keynote speakers at the Los Angeles conclave, which is expected to produce a blizzard of new product announcements from Internet start-up companies, many of them based in California's Silicon Valley. In additon to Intel's Gill, top executives from computer makers Apple Computer Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. are expected to speak at the conference. The Internet start-up explosion reached its peak nearly a year ago, when some Internet companies changed the rules of raising money in stock markets, where three years of profitability were considered a prerequisite for going public. Yahoo! Inc., for example, went public at a valuation that peaked in initial trading at over $1 billion on its first day of trading despite less than a year of full operating history and no assurance of profits in the foreseeable future. Despite the brakes applied to the Internet public offering market last summer, venture capital investment continues at a strong pace and major corporations are now going onto the World Wide Web, which continues to grow at a rapid clip. Start-ups with innovative products -- including technology that ""pushes"" news and software content to users instead of making them go out and get it and so-called intelligent agents that help sift through the huge mass of data on the Internet -- are expected to flock to the conference floor hoping to flaunt their wares. ""I don't think the number of start-ups will slow down (but) their dreams for (stock) valuations will be more realistic,"" said Gill, who is due to address the conference Thursday. Now people are ""hunkering down"" to focus on providing value to consumers and value to business, Gill said, adding that Intel itself has invested in smaller companies with pioneering technology and sought to foster new technologies, such as modems that run on cable televison systems and making telephone calls over the Internet. Gill sees JamTV, a new online music network developed with Digital Entertainment Networks, as an example of new Internet capabilities which also drive demand for higher-performance computers. For Intel, he said, the Internet is a ""wonderful opportunity"" because it could drive demand for more PC sales. The Internet World conference will be the next battleground in the war between Internet pioneer Netscape Communications Corp. and software giant Microsoft Corp. for leadership in the Internet software market. It also will give Apple Computer Chief Executive Gil Amelio another chance Wednesday to spell out his struggling company's Internet strategy, which he has said is core to its turnaround efforts, just two days before he is due to announce further layoffs in a fresh restructuring. Whatever the plight of individual companies, industry executives at a conference held near San Francisco Tuesday said they saw no slowdown in Internet demand. ""We've seen over 300 percent growth in our backbone in 1996,"" said Robert Hagens, director of MCI Communications Corp.'s Network MCI Service, referring to the company's core Internet service lines.

"The right-wing Czech coalition government ended nine uneasy months of ruling with a parliamentary minority on Tuesday when a former opposition deputy crossed the aisle to bring it a key seat. Tomas Teplik, recently expelled from the opposition Social Democratic Party (CSSD), joined Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS), an official in the ODS's parliament office told Reuters. The switch gives the ruling coalition 100 seats in the 200-seat lower house of parliament, after having a minority since general elections last June. ""I can confirm that the (ODS parliamentary) caucus voted to accept Teplik,"" said Vlasta Kloncarova of the ODS. Financial analysts welcomed the news which they said would increase confidence in the Czech economy. ""I would call it a higher level of comfort,"" said Jan Pudil, director of the Prague-based investment house WoodCommerz. ""This is going to take away the political questions... and keep investors focusing on the fundamentals in the macro-economy, which is the way it should be,"" he added. Klaus's coalition, which has held power longer than any conservative government in post-Communist Europe, lost its large majority in parliament last June after a surprisingly strong second place showing by the centre-left Social Democrats. Though divided on some issues, the coalition has remained united in all key votes. Another former CSSD member, budget committee chairman Josef Wagner, declared himself an independent last weekend after the Social Democrats expelled him for voting with the ruling coalition last December on the 1997 budget. The CSSD expelled Teplik -- who also voted with the government on the budget -- along with Wagner late last year, but unlike Wagner, Teplik did not try to rejoin the CSSD. Wagner's membership was officially terminated by the CSSD's national congress earlier this month, and he has said he will remain ""an independent Social Democrat."" He has said he will not necessarily vote with the government to give the coalition an absolute majority. Marie Noveska, who was elected as a CSSD deputy last June but resigned from the party after it was revealed that she had falsely used a ""Doctor of Law"" title, has remained in parliament as an independent.

"A Hong Kong government aircraft is to be the first to land at the territory's new Chek Lap Kok airport next month, a Civil Aviation Department spokesman told Reuters. A Beechcraft Super King 200, belonging to the Government Flying Service, and normally used for search and rescue missions, is due to make the maiden landing on February 20, the spokesman said. Initial reports said two American pilots flying a U.S. government Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) jet used to test the new airport's navigation instruments would be the first to land on the newly completed 3,800 metre long and sixty metres wide southern runway. But for ""ceremonial"" reasons the spokesman said the honour will be given to Hong Kong government pilots watched by invited guests and the media. ""The first landing will be an important milestone in the airport's history,"" the spokesman said. After the first flight, the specialised FAA aircraft is expected to start a test and calibration programme of the new airport's Instrument Landing System and navigation aids to prepare for the airport's opening in April next year, the spokesman added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44-171-542-5017 ","JimGilchrist"
"The yuan is expected to remain stable during the first half of this year, taking a break from its sharp rise over recent months, traders said on Wednesday. The yuan will move in a tight range between 8.2800 and 8.3500 to the dollar with Beijing determined to cap its rise despite steady upward pressure, they said. The yuan closed at a 20-month high of 8.2935 to the dollar on Wednesday on the Shanghai-based national foreign exchange interbank market, largely on the back of China's record high foreign exchange reserves of $105 billion at the end of 1996. ""We expect little movement in the yuan against the dollar in the first six months of this year,"" said a foreign exchange trader with a major Chinese bank. ""The economy is good with foreign exchange reserves hitting record highs, but this is being balanced by the higher cost of exports,"" he added. ""The central bank will not allow the yuan to fluctuate sharply under these conditions."" The yuan has risen slowly but inexorably over the past year from around 8.3174 at the beginning of 1996 -- a rise of just 0.29 percent, making it one of the most stable currencies in the world against the dollar. The rise reflects the overall improvement of the Chinese economy, but has added a slight extra burden to exporters. With the currency's continued strength, the central People's Bank of China has been intervening on almost a daily basis in the market to check the yuan's upward trend, traders said. One Shanghai foreign trade official said the average export cost of foreign exchange stood at 8.38 yuan for each dollar of exported goods in 1996, making exporters lose money when they turned trade surplus dollars into local currency. The central bank has also bought much local currency on the interbank market in the past few months, partly to prevent over-supply of the yuan from fanning inflation, analysts said. Overall, the central bank is buying in both dollars and yuan to dampen the market, they added. China's retail price inflation fell to a year-on-year 6.1 percent in 1995 from 14.8 percent year-on-year in 1995. But fixed-asset investment surged again in the second half of last year after Beijing cut bank interest rates in May and August, threatening to rekindle inflation, traders said. ""Despite the fall in inflation last year, the central bank is expected to continue to take a cautious approach,"" said a second foreign exchange trader. ""Its intervention on the market to prevent sharp rises and falls of the yuan will continue. ""The central government has made it clear it will continue its tight credit policy to prevent a revival of inflation,"" he added. ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"Most Chinese have been slow to forgive and forget Japanese atrocities in World War Two and fear a possible resurgence of militarism in the land of the rising sun, a survey published in Beijing on Saturday showed. The survey, conducted by the official China Youth Daily last December, showed that 99.4 percent of 15,000 people interviewed nationwide thought young Chinese ""should remember"" Japan's 1931-45 occupation of China. More than 97 percent of the respondents were aged below 40, too young to have been victims of Japan's war atrocities. By Beijing's count, 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded by invading Japanese troops. Asked what first came to their minds when Japan was mentioned, 81.3 percent of respondents said the Rape of Nanjing. Japanese troops marched into Nanjing, China's pre-communist capital and known then as Nanking, in 1937 and engaged in an orgy of rape and massacre. Up to 250,000 Chinese were believed to have been killed. More than 97 percent of respondents said they could not tolerate repeated attempts by Japanese officials to whitewash their wartime atrocities, including the Rape of Nanjing. The China Youth Daily survey showed that 94.9 percent of the respondents were opposed to Japan becoming a United Nations Security Council member. It also showed that 85.1 percent of respondents believed Japan wanted to become a military superpower and 70.7 percent saw Japan as a new threat to peace in Asia. China itself ruffled feathers in the region last March when it intimidated rival Taiwan by conducting missile tests and war games close to the island in the run-up to Taiwan's historic presidential elections. The sheer size of the People's Liberation Army -- the world's biggest at three million -- has caused uneasiness among China's neighbours. China has been mired in a dispute with Japan over a group of islands in the East China Sea and another dispute with Asian neighbours over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. The survey showed that 53.8 percent of respondents thought that Japanese despised Chinese, while 50.8 percent said Japanese discriminated against Chinese. Many Chinese themselves harbour deep suspicions and are hostile toward foreigners. More than 56 percent of the respondents said the Japanese were ""cruel"", 45.2 percent said ""arrogant"" and 45.3 percent described them as ""war freaks"" by nature. But 52.7 percent of the respondents said they owned Japanese-made electrical appliances. Many respondents were suspicious of Japanese motives for investing in China. More than half said Japanese investment aimed to control China, while 45.3 percent said Japan dumped outdated equipment in China. On Friday, the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, accused the United States and Japan of covering up the U.S. military's firing of uranium-tipped bullets near Okinawa during drills in December 1995 and January 1996. The United States apologised this month. The People's Daily said Washington's argument that the bullets were mislabelled was unconvincing and questioned why the incident was kept a secret for more than a year. ","BenjaminKangLim"
"The Busang rumor mill continued to churn on Wednesday as a jittery market weighed Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc's move to extend its review of the controversial gold project. Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd said on Wednesday that Freeport was granted an extension for its due diligence review of the Busang project until June 30. New Orleans-based Freeport, a partner in the Busang find, requested the extension ""to allow for consideration of the findings of the Strathcona audit,"" Bre-X said. Rumors have swirled around Busang since the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partneb Freeport-McMoRan said its preliminary due diligence tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold. Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) or 80 percent from the company's stock market value last month. Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd is expected to deliver a key report on Busang to Bre-X on Thursday or Friday. Bre-X has said it will issue a press release on the report before North American financial markets open on Monday. Freeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday the request for the extension was made within the past week. ""The original agreement with Bre-X signed on February 26 said that FCX's due diligence expire on April 30. This is really just to announce that we had pushed that date to June 30 to allow time for completion of the independent audit by Strathcona,"" Lemkau said in a telephone interview. Strathcona has said its final report to Bre-X would be delivered about six weeks after the interim report. Strathcona has said the principal conclusions in the interim report are not expected to differ from the final report. Lemkau declined to comment when asked if Freeport planned any further drilling at Busang over the next two months. Bre-X shares led heavy traders on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday, closing down C32 (US23) cents at C$3.48 ($2.52) on 9.7 million shares. Some investors on an Internet chat page speculated on Wednesday that Freeport's extension was favorable to Bre-X. But mining analysts cautioned against reading too much into the announcement. ""I don't think we should read into the request, although obviously investors are,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc. ""Everybody is reading a lot into the rumors. But really they are just rumors right now,"" another Canadian mining analyst said. An Indonesian newspaper, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier this week that leaked results of Strathcona's drill tests showed ""cheerful"" grades of gold. But in a report in the Calgary Sun newspaper on Wednesday, Strathcona President Graham Farquharson said it was unlikely that his company's findings had been leaked. ""I still haven't seen the results myself -- the assays are still under way. So I have to doubt the claim,"" Farquharson said in the Sun report. ""To the best of my knowledge there've been no leaks,"" Farquharson said. Strathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada, Indonesia and Australia. Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory would have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"Vencor Inc. has a definitive agreement to acquire Theratx Inc., another health care service provider, for $354 million, or $17.10 per share, in cash, the companies said Monday. Vencor said it expected to begin a tender offer for all of Theratx's roughly 20.7 million shares on Feb. 14. Theratx's stock shot up $3.50 to $16.625 on Nasdaq. Vencor was unchanged at $32.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. ""This will make Vencor the only company out there that can offer the long-term care hospital, the nursing home and the contract services,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Robert Thornburg. Vencor is the nation's largest long-term care hospital company. It also has sub-acute care units, nursing homes and speciality care centres for respiratory therapy. Last spring, Vencor acquired Hillhaven Corp. for $1.9 billion. ""Vencor wants very much to be big and this makes them bigger,"" Hindelong said of the Theratx deal. ""It's probably not the last major acquisition that they'll make."" Analysts said Vencor expected the deal to boost earnings in the second half of 1997. Vencor said it expected to close the deal within 90 days. Vencor, based in Louisville, Ky., said the acquisition would broaden its menu of contract services, which includes subacute, rehabilitation and respiratory therapy services to nursing and subacute centres. Vencor operates an integrated, long-term healthcare network with 38 long-term acute care hospitals, 279 nursing centres, 41 institutional pharmacies and, through its Atria Communities affiliate, 23 independent and assisted living communities. Theratx, which went public in 1994, operates 29 nursing homes and sells rehabilitation services under contract to dozens of other nursing home companies. Like others in the field, its stock for months has been weighed down by uncertainty about the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration's rewrite of Medicare reimbursement rules for such services. ""It was just a cloud hanging over their heads. So there was a lot of incentive on the part of (Theratx CEO) John Bardis to go out and do something like this,"" said Arneson Kercheville analyst Jay Somaney. ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"Moves by two of Japan's most troubled banks to tackle their massive problem loans are not enough to get in shape for Japan's sweeping ""Big Bang"" financial deregulation, analysts said on Tuesday. Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd, Japan's 10th biggest commercial bank, and regional bank Hokkaido Bank Ltd, both based in Sapporo, announced they would merge next April and withdraw from overseas operations by next March. Long-troubled Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB), the smallest of the nation's three long-term credit banks, separately announced that it will restructure, halting overseas operations, selling off its Tokyo headquarters and posting losses to dispose of problem loans. ""As for the merger agreement by the two Hokkaido banks to restructure their operations, it is not impressive at all,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice-president of Smith Barney International Inc. ""The restructuring programme announced by Nippon Credit Bank is quite drastic, but when taking into account the size of its massive problem loans, the programme falls short of solving its bad loan woes,"" he said. Hokkaido Takushoku and NCB are among the nation's weakest banks. The Moody's Investors Service ratings agency assigns its lowest ""E"" ratings to both institutions, along with Chuo Trust &amp; Banking and Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking. ""There are no U.S. banks which received an E rating. Banks with E ratings are those which have been supported (in Japan's regulated system) despite their inefficiency,"" a Moody's officer recently said. After the announcement of the merger and the restructuring plans, a spokeswoman at Moody's said that analysts in Tokyo and New York were expected to hold a ratings meeting later in the day but did not say if any ratings would be changed. The Hokkaido merger is seen as putting two problem institutions together, some analysts said. ""It's a step in the right direction but they are taking two banks with huge bad debt problems -- merge them together and you've got a colossal bad debt problem to deal with,"" said Brian Waterhouse, an analyst at HSBC James Capel. ""Unless we see some public funds being used to assist with this it is unlikely that they will deal with all their problem loans before the merger,"" he said. Problem loans at Hokkaido Takushoku totalled 936 billion yen ($7.54 billion) at the end of last September, accounting for 13.34 percent of loans outstanding. Hokkaido Bank said its problem loans totalled 167 billion yen ($1.34 billion) at the end of September, but financial analysts say the actual number is larger. NCB will meanwhile dispose of 460 billion yen ($3.70 billion) in problem loans in 1996/97, enabling the bank to cover 48 percent of its problem loan portfolio. However, Yukiko Ohara, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd, said that NCB's restructuring is not enough to solve the problem loan mess. ""In order to tackle Japan's problem loan woes, you will have to set up a clear system to determine how public money will be used,"" she said. ($1=124) ","FumikoFujisaki"
"The French telecommunications market, which opens to full competition in 1998, seems be hotting up despite denials that Nippon Telecom and Telegraph Co (NTT) will enter the fray, analysts said on Thursday. Whether the NTT story was correct or not, 1997 would be full of alliances and deals, they said. ""If you want to be in France after liberalisation, you have to make your move now,"" a Paris-based analyst said. The Financial Times newspaper reported that NTT was planning to spend $500 million to take a 10 percent stake in Cegetel alongside British Telecom Plc. But a spokesman for Cegetel, the company aiming to rival France Telecom as a national operator in 1998, said no changes were planned in its shareholding capital. ""The capital make-up of Cegetel will be the one we announced in September with British Telecom, Mannesmann and SBC Communications Inc,"" said a spokesman of the joint venture controlled by Generale des Eaux. BT will have around 25 percent, SBC 15 percent and Mannesmann 10 percent. In Tokyo, NTT said it was not considering investing in the French telecoms market. ""We're not in a situation to positively consider any such action. Everything is up in the air,"" a spokesman told Reuters. Cegetel had previously said there might be marginal changes in the shareholdings. But in Paris the spokesman said: ""They are about to be fixed and it's roughly like we have announced them."" From January 1, 1998, when the European telecommunications market is liberalised, France Telecom will lose the last vestiges of its monopoly. It will still be majority state-owned, after a partial flotation this year, and will be responsible for the so-called ""public service"" of telecommunications, but other companies will be able to apply for operating licences. An independent regulator, l'Autorite de Regulation des Telecommunications (ART), will oversee the market. Cegetel is so far the only big grouping to have announced its intention to set up against France Telecom as a national operator. The company already runs France's second biggest mobile telecommunications network, SFR. Bouygues Telecom has teamed up with VEBA of Germany and STET of Italy for telecoms ventures but it has not yet detailed how far its ambitions stretch beyond mobile telecommunications and business services. Waiting in the wings are Unisource and AT &amp; T. Unisource, a joint venture of Dutch PTT, Telia of Sweden, Swiss Telecom PTT and Spain's Telefonica, was previously a Generale des Eaux partner but they broke up after the Cegetel deal with BT. U.S. giant AT &amp; T, which has not hidden its ambition to be a big player in all the main European telecommunications markets, is concluding the Uniworld alliance with Unisource. On Thursday AT &amp; T and Unisource teamed up with Mannesmann for the German telecommunications market. France Telecom itself is allied to Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp of the United States. Smaller rivals, operating on target markets in France, are MFS Communications and Colt Telecom Plc of Britain as well as a telecoms subsidiary of Eurotunnel SA/Plc. MFS's new owner WorldCom Inc has recently stated its intention to obtain a licence as national operator. -- Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452 ","MarcelMichelson"
"Hong Kong's business community extended a cautious welcome on Tuesday to U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's trade privileges and said they hoped the U.S. Congress would not strike down the move. The extension of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status was particularly important to Hong Kong, now preparing for its return to Chinese rule on July 1, they said. ""The chamber is very happy,"" Erica Ng, assistant manager of international affairs at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, told Reuters. ""Every year, we carry out lobbying activities to persuade the U.S. government to renew China's MFN."" ""We welcome the decision. However we would say at this stage it is still to receive the endorsement by Congress. There is a long way to go,"" Christopher Hammerbeck, executive director of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told Reuters. Clinton on Monday announced his decision to renew China's MFN status for another year, but the move is expected to face fierce opposition from Congress. Social conservatives, organised labour and other opponents are preparing for a fight, pointing to China's policies on human and religious rights, trade and other issues. Many in Congress were wary of China's plans to curb some freedoms in Hong Kong after the handover, Frank Martin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong, told government radio. ""Many members of Congress indicated concern on the perceived rollback of civil liberties in Hong Kong,"" he said. Martin was in Washington last week as part of an AmCham delegation lobbying for a renewal of China's MFN status. ""Others mentioned the allegations of China's involvement in election campaign fundraising (in the United States). The trade deficit is a perennial problem -- it is neither economically nor politically sustainable,"" he said. Hong Kong's business community said U.S. Congress members should bear in mind the importance of China's trade status to Hong Kong. ""Hong Kong could lose very much in re-export trade,"" Ng said. ""We hope that Congress can understand that it is a critical year for Hong Kong because of the handover. ""If it is not renewed, it will affect Hong Kong economically and greatly affect confidence in the territory,"" she said. The chambers of commerce say Hong Kong could lose up to US$30 billion annually in trade and related industry revenues. Gross domestic product growth could be cut by about three percentage points and some 86,000 jobs in Hong Kong could be lost if China loses its trading privileges. ""We recognise fully not only the vital importance of China but the collateral impact it has on the prosperity of Hong Kong,"" Hammerbeck of the British business chamber said. ""The membership of this chamber employs not only 300,000 Hong Kong people but we also employ large numbers of Chinese citizens in China."" -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6441 ","TanEeLyn"
"Citizens spilled into public places across China on Saturday to mourn the late leader Deng Xiaoping, acting spontaneously in the face of a lack of official memorial activities. State television has been running endless official paeans to Deng and showing formal mourning activities organised by Chinese officials in Hong Kong, Washington and other foreign cities. But in China itself, and especially the capital Beijing, the state has done little to encourage public shows of mourning, leaving the citizenry to do things themselves. In Deng's home village of Paifang in southwestern Sichuan province, tens of thousands of mourners have thronged to the courtyard of his birth since the community's favourite son died on Wednesday night. In the Sichuan capital Chengdu, people poured into People's Square on Thursday and by nightfall the crowd swelled past 10,000, many carrying candles, witnesses said by telephone. In the absence of a Deng portrait, people gathered round a statue of China's revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. ""For us here it's tumultuous,"" a worker at a hotel on the square told Reuters. ""Not only in Chengdu but all across Sichuan province, it's tumultuous."" The crowds thinned on Friday and Saturday, but officials were tolerating the square's use as a centre for mourning and many people were weeping openly over Deng's death. Many came on outings organised by their work units. ""There are several hundred police, traffic police and People's Armed Police to maintain order and prevent people getting hurt,"" the hotel worker said. In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, a special economic zone near Hong Kong that was Deng's earliest reform brainchild, hundreds of people filed past a giant Deng billboard which had been turned into a makeshift shrine. The billboard stands in a square beside one of Deng's most stunning innovations, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which Deng said proved that markets were acceptable not only in capitalist societies but also under socialism. Mourners placed wreaths of white and yellow chrysanthemums below the billboard, some draped with white streamers bearing Deng's reformist slogans or newspaper clippings about a 1992 visit Deng made to Shenzhen to jumpstart his stalling reforms. ""We wish you heavenly peace,"" read one streamer. Said another: ""Thank you for the reform and opening up."" ""There's no public organised mourning of Deng, but I think this is better because people who come to mourn for Deng do it from the bottom of their hearts,"" said a policeman named Chen. At Shenzhen's botanical garden, someone had hung a black and white portrait of Deng from a banyan tree that Deng planted in 1992. Scores of people burned incense and bowed three times in the traditional Chinese form of mourning. ""Uncle Deng, we miss you!"" wailed a kneeling man surnamed Jin who had brought his year-old child. ""Come child, pay your respect to Uncle Deng."" ""I was shattered by the news of his death,"" Jin said later. ""He has done simply too much for us. I can find no words to express my grief and can only repay him by working harder."" Deng's legacy of markets was quietly thriving at a nearby private floral shop, whose owner was doing brisk business selling a fresh shipment of flowers. ""Of course I'm happy. I've sold more than 10,000 yuan (US$1,200) worth of chrysanthemums today,"" she said. ","WilliamKazer"
"""Superwoman"" pension fund manager Nicola Horlick announced her resignation on Thursday from Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) only days after she was reported to have been offered a promotion at the firm. A spokesman for Horlick, who had been head of British pension fund business at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's MGAM, told Reuters she had quit and was planning legal action against her former employer over ""constructive dismissal"". Horlick, dubbed superwoman in financial circles because of her ability to hold a high-powered job while looking after five children, was suspended at MGAM on Tuesday, prompting reports of unease among large pension fund clients at the firm. The suspension was pending the outcome of an internal investigation into what Deutsche Morgan Grenfell described as ""a potential breach of her contract"". ""She has resigned,"" a spokesman for Horlick said. ""She will be taking (legal) action against DMG."" The dispute with MGAM was believed to revolve around allegations that Horlick tried to take a number of her MGAM team with her in a move to Dutch bank ABN AMRO. But the row erupted only days after Horlick received news of a promotion to managing director from MGAM chief executive Robert Smith, a banking source said. ""They shook hands on it last Friday,"" the source said. MGAM last year was rocked by revelations of misvaluations in three of its funds and the subsequent sacking of fund manager Peter Young, who is currently under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office. Young has denied any involvement in criminal activity. Horlick, in an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday, described disquiet at MGAM over the Young affair, She said the promotion came after a group of fund managers who worked under her said they would leave the company unless she be given more authority. Around six MGAM fund managers and a senior executive met for dinner on Thursday last week, she said in the newspaper interview. ""They demanded that I be given more authority. They felt that things were in turmoil following the Peter Young affair."" Pension fund clients of DMG, the investment banking arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank, are said to be unsettled by the Horlick saga. But DMG said on Thursday that it did not expect any exodus of its pension fund clients. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 6784 ","AlexanderSmith"
"Australasian-based building products group James Hardie Industries Ltd posted weaker annual profits on Wednesday, but forecast its expanding U.S. fibre cement and gypsum units would drive a profit surge in 1997/98. ""For the first time in several years we have the production capacity to meet U.S. market demand,"" James Hardie managing director Keith Barton said. ""If current trading conditions prevail, we expect very strong growth in (U.S.) sales and earnings to continue in the year ahead,"" Barton told a briefing for analysts and reporters. ""(Group) operating profit after tax for the current year will improve significantly compared to the past year,"" he said. James Hardie's net profit jumped to A$83 million (US$63 million) in the year to March 31 from A$32.2 million in 1995/96, but this was due largely to a A$31.7 million abnormal profit from asset sales. Profit before abnormals fell 12.3 percent to A$51.3 million because of sharply lower Australasian buliding materials profits and this was in line with expectations. But Barton's comments at the briefing about continuing weakness in the Australian and New Zealand building materials markets prompted some analysts to downgrade their forecasts for the 1997/98 year. James Hardies' Australian operations, hit by a 12 percent fall in home construction, slumped to a A$800,000 pre-tax loss in 1996/97 from a A$33.8 million profit in 1995/96. New Zealand profits fell eight percent to A$31.9 million. Barton said competition in Australia and New Zealand remained intense and would continue to slice away at sales, margins and profits in 1997/98. ""The modest recovery in Australian housing construction will not be sufficient to offset the impact of growing competition on our Australian fibre cement business,"" Barton said. Increased imports would pressure margins and volumes in New Zealand, he said. Barton also told the analysts briefing that new competition coming on stream in the United States and James Hardie's drive to increase market share there would pressure prices down. ""We may have to discount ... be more aggressive against engineered wood products and against PVC,"" he said. ""But that doesn't necessarily mean a reduction in margins,"" he said, adding sales volumes would continue to grow and economies of scale were still to be obtained, Barton said. Some analysts said Barton's comments about Australasian weakness and U.S. price pressure would force them to downgrade their 1997/98 pre-abnormal profit forecasts to about A$80 million to A$85 million from A$90 million to A$90 million before the results. ABN AMRO Hoare Govett building materials analyst Fabian Babich said he would keep his 1997/98 forecast at A$80 million. Hardie kept its final dividend for 1996/97 unchanged at 6.5 cents per share, taking full year dividends to an unchanged 13.0 cents per share. Hardie is about 28 percent owned by Brierley Investments Ltd. Hardie's shares closed down 15 cents at A$4.05. (A$1 = US$0.76) ","BernardHickey"
"As megadealer H. Wayne Huizenga continued to gobble up more new car franchises Monday, the National Automobile Dealers Association's top economist said traditional dealers are poised to grab more of the used vehicle market and exploit their superior parts service. ""All in all, we have a pretty favourable outlook in terms of our industry,"" Tom Webb, chief economist of NADA, told a news conference at the group's annual convention. Webb's comments came hours after Huizenga's Republic Industries Inc. announced the purchase of Wallace Automotive Group, a six-dealer group that operates Ford, Nissan, Dodge, Mitsubishi and two Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in southeast Florida. The deal, valued at $55 million, pushes Republic's total 1997 new dealer revenue estimates for 1997 to about $2.8 billion, a Republic spokesman said, erasing any doubt that Republic is now the largest new vehicle dealer group in the country in terms of revenues. In a swipe at the superstore trend, Webb disputed the idea that selling large volumes of new or used vehicles will cut more costs or generate higher profits. One analysis conducted by NADA showed economies of scale benefits stop after 100 vehicles a month. ""People who think that just increasing volume is the answer are totally wrong,"" he said. The new car market remains a mature one, Webb said, with average 1996 dealer profits per vehicle at about $40. The used vehicle segment is growing twice as quickly, he said, because franchisers are picking up more business from small, less-sophisticated used car operators, as well as people who no longer prefer trying to sell a car or truck themselves. Traditional dealers now control about 31 percent of used retail unit sales and have a 50 percent share of the market in terms of revenue dollars, said Webb. Retail sales of used vehicles number between 40 million and 45 million a year, he said. ""I think the franchised dealer share will grow,"" he said. Webb also believes franchised dealers can make gains with their parts and service operations, which he said consistently receive high quality rankings. Webb said traditional dealers have an inherent advantage over superstores structured like CarMax, a unit of Circuit Cities Stores Inc. , because they have more than one profit centre. The CarMax chain now only makes money from one area -- used cars, according to Webb. But franchised dealers make money off used cars, parts and financing. Franchised dealers have also benefited from growth in lending to higher-risk buyers. Even if those loans later become delinquent, it is not the dealer's problem, as he or she has already made money from the sale, Webb said. He said he is not concerned about consumer debt levels hurting vehicle sales. Although some industry experts believe the overall selling cycle is becoming more stable, he said the industry still remains vulnerable to a downturn in the economy. ""A new vehicle is a very postponeable purchase,"" said Webb. ""So if the economy weakens, yes, we will suffer."" For 1997, NADA predicts there will be a net loss of 100 to 150 dealerships, continuing a gradual consolidation that has been under way since the 1940s. According to NADA, there were 22,000 new vehicle dealers in 1996, more than 50,000 franchises and about 15,000 dealer principals. ","ToddNissen"
"The U.S. government is scrambling to update thousands of computer systems and software programmes that might otherwise see January 1, 2000 as ""00"" and think they are operating in 1900. ""We are confident that all of the major systems will be fixed,"" said Sally Katzen, who is coordinating much of the repair effort from her post as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget. ""That is what we are setting out to do and that is what we will do,"" she pledged in an interview. Legislators in Congress have also taken an interest in the subject and prodded agencies into action. Most are well aware of the problem, congressional staff say, although a few slackers including the air traffic control system are raising concerns. ""Congress is sounding the alarm and will keep sounding it until this problem is solved,"" Representative Steve Horn told Reuters. Horn, chairman of the Government Reform Committee's Management, Information and Technology sub-committee, has taken testimony from a variety of government and private-sector experts on the year 2000 problem. ""I have learned that the real challenge it poses is to management,"" Horn said. ""Software experts are capable of fixing the problem but can management understand what is at stake, make it a priority, organise a plan and allocate resources so the technical experts can do their job?"" GOVERNMENT AGENCIES READY TO ADJUST FOR MILLENNIUM The sub-committee surveyed government agencies about year 2000 awareness last year and responses to an updated survey have just come in. The latest survey found that all agencies are aware of the problem and most are ready to put in place the needed fixes, a congressional staffer said. Some of the agencies that people are most concerned about, the Defence Department and the Social Security Administration, appear to be in good shape and have extensive plans to fix the problem well before December 31, 1999. At the Defence Department, ""we are treating it much as we would a computer virus,"" Assistant Secretary of Defence Emmett Paige told Horn's sub-committee. Although weapons systems are not set to launch automatically by computers, problems could crop up when the weapons interact with command and control systems that are operated by computers, congressional staffers explained. During the Gulf War, a command and control system that was scheduled to run for 12 hours began shutting down weapon systems it was in contact with after running a few hours past its deadline. ""That would obviously be a disaster, but they're working on it,"" said one staffer. Social security is also a primary focus of concern, but for more political reasons. Millions of voters depend on their social security cheques for meeting basic living expenses. If the cheques were delayed or cancelled, Congress would probably be inundated with thousands of complaints. ""They started the earliest but they have a lot to do and still aren't finished,"" a staffer said. ""My sense is that they will be fine."" CONCERN OVER AVIATION One agency of concern, according to congressional staffers, is the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates the country's air traffic control system and inspects commercial airplanes. ""The Department of Transportation is very worrisome,"" one staffer said. ""The FAA is still in the assessment phase. That's the one that's a real concern."" The agency cannot give an estimate of how many lines of code it has that must be changed, or how much that might cost, until it completes an assessment expected by the end of May, according to Mary Powers-King, who heads the FAA's information technology effort. ""It's somewhat painful because no new funding has been appropriated and we're having to reprogramme to absorb the activity,"" Powers-King said. ""That is a big part of the reason why we started late. We've got that figured out now and we've got to just bite the bullet."" Overall, recent estimates indicate the federal government will need to spend $2.4 to $2.5 billion to identify and correct year 2000 computer problems, Katzen said. The estimate has risen slightly from about $2.3 billion a few months ago. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see them come another ($100 to $300 million) as we continue through the process of assessment,"" Katzen said. ""But I think that we've got it in just about the right ballpark."" In a February 7, 1997 report to Congress, the budget office projected that the military needed the largest portion of the money for updates. The Air Force would require $371 million, the Army $218 million, the Navy $90 million and other defence-related areas $291 million. Other big spenders in the report were the Treasury Department, needing $319 million, and the Veterans Administration, needing $144 million. ","AaronPressman"
"China's top prosecutors have vowed to crack down on corruption among the ranks of leading officials in the government and ruling Communist Party, state media said on Tuesday. The call for tougher action to curb growing official graft came as senior leaders considered whether to punish scandal-hit former Beijing Party boss Chen Xitong for dereliction of duty. In the first 11 months of 1996, Chinese procurators had begun action in 77,611 cases of corruption, bribery and economic crime and had dealt with 33,879 cases, up 9.4 percent compared with the same period of 1995, the China News Service said. ""China's legal organs will make more efforts to deal with major embezzlement and bribery cases involving officials next year,"" the official Xinhua news agency quoted Deputy Procurator General Liang Guoqing as telling a conference in Beijing. Prosecutors would focus on major corruption cases involving leading officials in the ruling Communist Party, government and law enforcement agencies, Liang said. The number of graft cases involving more than 10,000 yuan ($1,200) was growing fast, said the China News Service. On Monday, a top Beijing official said China's party leadership was considering whether to have disgraced capital party boss Chen Xitong charged for dereliction of duty. ""Viewing the situation from the case of Wang Baosen, he (Chen) can't escape dereliction of duty,"" Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa told reporters in a reference to a former Beijing vice-mayor who committed suicide last year after coming under investigation for corruption. Investigators had uncovered no evidence to show that Chen, one of China's most influential men until he fell from power in the corruption scandal, was guilty of more serious wrongdoing. Beijing has repeatedly launched crackdowns on graft, which senior leaders have called a cancer that threatens the Communist Party's grip on power, but many Chinese say enforcement of anti-corruption measures at senior levels is patchy at best. ""Procuratorial agencies at all levels should at all times make dealing with major cases, especially those involving crimes by leading officials, the key point in pushing the deepening of the war on corruption,"" the Xinhua Daily Telegraph said. Anti-graft vigilance would be essential in 1997, a key year for China's economic reforms, it quoted procurator Liang as telling the five-day conference of prosecutors in the capital. Construction officials have said that as much as 10 percent of the cost of new buildings can disappear into the pockets of contractors. Pharmaceutical salesmen say many doctors are only willing to prescribe drugs if they are paid to do so. Public perceptions of endemic graft have pushed Beijing to seek new ways to stiffen flagging moral and fiscal rectitude among officials, who have seen their formal salaries trail far behind the incomes of entrepreneurs and private sector workers. From January 1 next year the Ministry of Public Security would for the first time begin requiring China's police to swear an oath of loyalty, discipline and honesty, Xinhua said. ""This... is a way of getting police to show respect for the responsibility they bear,"" the agency said. The oath would include pledges of loyalty first to the Communist Party, then to the people and the law. Officers would also vow to be honest. ","MureDickie"
"China is pressing ahead with a controversial plan to roll back civil rights and democracy in Hong Kong, with its tough line on the territory unshaken by the death of leader Deng Xiaoping. Deng, who died last week, was the architect of the ""one country two systems"" formula for the conversion of Hong Kong into a special, autonomous capitalist zone of China when British rule ends at midnight on June 30. Despite widespread misgivings about China in this bustling territory of 6.4 million people, thousands of residents paid respects to Deng for the fourth day on Monday in a mourning ceremony at China's official mission. On Sunday night, China's parliament approved a plan to throw out or amend a clutch of Hong Kong laws, including those that provide for democratic elections and protect civil liberties. The plan trims back a bill of rights, a law on forming political parties and another on free association which takes a liberal approach to public protests and demonstrations. The laws were part of London's effort to create a democratic framework in Hong Kong in the twilight of more than 150 years of British rule. Beijing has justified its onslaught against Hong Kong's fledgling democracy by accusing Britain of treaty violations with Hong Kong's recent democratic reforms. ""China's latest move means the die is now very much cast,"" a spokesman for the Hong Kong Democratic Party told Reuters in reference to the National People's Congress's (NPC) Sunday decision. ""China has shown it is not going to respect the will of Hong Kong people. The NPC is a political body making a decision that will remake Hong Kong in blatant breach of handover agreements which say Hong Kong's laws shall remain unchanged."" He said the move violated both the internationally registered 1984 Sino-British handover treaty, known as the Joint Declaration, as well as Hong Kong's future constitution, the Basic Law. Beijing's move to crimp basic freedoms flies in the face of official protests by Britain. London has challenged China to go to the World Court to seek a ruling on the legality of Beijing's plan to replace Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council with an appointed provisional legislature. In a related development, a leading Hong Kong member of the Preparatory Committee on the handover told reporters Hong Kong would not be allowed to amend new election rules that the panel was preparing for the territory. Neither Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting, Tung Chee-hwa, the provisional legislature, nor the post-colonial government, could change the rules, Lau Siu-kai said. Slightly over half of Preparatory Committee members are from Hong Kong and the rest are from the mainland. Its decisions generally echo policy statements by senior Beijing officials. The rules would govern the first election of a long-term legislature some time in 1998 to replace a provisional body that China has appointed to make laws from July 1. It had not been clear how much say Hong Kong people would have in setting the rules. A Hong Kong business leader and pro-China politician set to join Tung's Executive Council said the cabinet would play a much greater role in policy making than it had done under outgoing colonial Governor Chris Patten. But the businessman, Henry Tang, head of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, also said he expected no big policy changes under Tung, a Shanghai-born shipping billionaire. ","PeterHumphrey"
"Australia's Trust Bank has begun looking for a strategic equity partner, inviting offers for a 49 percent stake and announcing plans to put the small, 162-year-old bank on the map. But Australian banks need not apply, nor any foreigners which do not share Trust Bank's ambition to expand beyond the shores of Australia's small island state of Tasmania, managing director Paul Kemp told Reuters. ""We will be very keen to sort out anybody who thinks they can come in and make a quick killing,"" Kemp said.   ""They won't really get to first base with us."" Kemp was responding to media speculation that prospective partners would be interested in acquiring the stake to enable it to issue credit cards in Australia. ""We would have a broader vision than just that for the franchise.

"China said on Monday it had not made contributions to the U.S. Democratic Party to influence American policy and the visit by U.S. Vice President Al Gore had no link to improper payments. The official People's Daily also pointed an accusing finger at Taiwan for stirring up accusations of Chinese involvement to try to shift blame from itself. ""The Chinese government is not involved in the so-called 'political contributions scandal' in the slightest way and is entirely free of guilt,"" said the newspaper in a signed commentary. The Washington Post has reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six members of Congress last year that they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign contributions from foreign corporations. ""The development of Sino-U.S. relations is based on principles,"" the People's Daily said. Gore is scheduled to arrive in Beijing later on Monday, making him the most senior U.S. official to visit in eight years. His trip is aimed at healing ties that had been badly strained by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan. It is also intended to pave the way for an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin. ""The continuation of high level visits, such as the visit of U.S. Vice President Gore and others, is due to the efforts of the two governments and their peoples,"" the newspaper said. ""To insist that this is linked to the so-called contributions scandal is ridiculous,"" it said. ""It is a complete fabrication to allege that the improvement in Sino-U.S. relations is due to any improper payments by the Chinese government."" The People's Daily commentary condemned Taiwan as well as news organisations from the island for the storm of criticism that has engulfed China. ""It is widely known that the 'political payments case' stems from Taiwan,"" the newspaper said. It referred to a report last year by a Hong Kong publication, the Chinese language edition of Asiaweek magazine, that said Liu Tai-ying, head of the business management committee of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, had expressed a willingness to contribute $15 million. The People's Daily did not mention that Taiwan has denied the allegations and has sued the magazine. ""For some Taiwan politicians it appears that the best way out of their troubles is to put the blame elsewhere,"" said the newspaper. Taiwan and China have been rivals since the Nationalists fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the communists in 1949. The United States formally recognises China but maintains trade and other unofficial ties with Taiwan. Washington sent warships near Taiwan in a show of support when Beijing staged war games and missile tests to intimidate the island early last year. ","WilliamKazer"
"Wickes Plc, the British do-it-yourself retailer whose former bosses are being investigated for fraud, warned on Thursday it faced receivership unless investors backed its financial restructuring including a 53 million pound ($87.5 million) rights issue. The recent discovery of accounting irregularities dating back five years forced the group to announce a major refinancing, including a cash call and the possible sale of its continental business. Wickes chairman Michael von Brentano told shareholders that if investors voted against the plans at the extraordinary general meeting on January 6 ""it would be likely that the company would be placed in receivership."" The rights issue is part of a shake-up which includes a capital reduction of 100 million pounds and new banking facilities of 52 million pounds. The refinancing aims to eliminate the deficit on the firm's profit and loss account. The troubled company said in a statement: ""The directors believe that the group is now in a position where, if the proposals and proposed banking arrangements are implemented, it can build on its market position, return to profitability and deliver a successful ""New Wickes."" Wickes accounting debacle, which was uncovered in June and triggered a share suspension, led to a major overstatement of profits, forcing the group to restate 1995 results. Revised accounts showed a 1995 loss before tax of 279.3 million pounds, 21.3 million more than originally reported. Wickes said it expected to make a loss before tax in 1996 of not more than 56 million pounds, with losses of 52.7 million pounds reported for the nine months to September 28. It will not pay an interim dividend in 1996 or 1997, but may pay a final dividend in 1997 and an interim for 1998. Under the cash call itself, 37,822,310 new shares will be offered at 150 pence per new share with one new share for every 10 old shares. The rights issue proceeds will be used to cut group debt. The chairman said the trading outlook for the group was improving with 1996 cumulative like-for-like sales growth of 4.1 percent over 1995. He said the investigation into former Wickes bosses by the police and Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was not expected to result in any liability for the group. The newly appointed chairman blamed the accounting bombshell on ""deliberate misrepresentation"" in accounting procedures, blaming ""serious mismanagement"" in group operations. Von Brentano has pledged to clean up accounting procedures and has installed a new team to replace the old guard which has resigned, including former chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum. The SFO has already indicated that it will be interviewing all the former senior executives of Wickes as part of its investigation. No charges or arrests have been made to date.

"British Telecommunications Plc flexed its muscles on Thursday, saying it would not hesitate to launch a legal challenge to any government windfall tax on its profits. Reporting a rise in annual pretax profits to 3.2 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) from 3.02 billion, chairman Sir Iain Vallance said the group owed it to its investors to attempt to fight any Labour plans to tax its earnings. ""If we are stung in a big way for this tax and if it can be challenged legally, we owe it to our shareholders to challenge it,"" Vallance told BBC radio. But he added the company would be ""very sad"" to start a partnership with Labour, which swept to power on May 1 for the first time in 18 years, on such a footing. ""I would not have voted Labour had (a windfall tax on BT) been in the manifesto,"" Vallance told reporters. The government says it will levy a one-off tax on what it calls the ""excess profits"" of privatised utilities, whose large executive salaries and surging dividend payments to shareholders have enraged consumer groups. Labour, which wants to raise money to help get the young and long-term unemployed back to work, declines to identify the firms it plans to target and BT's comments found favour with another potential target -- BAA. The British airports operator is taking legal advice and accused Labour of ""verging on irresponsibility"" by not detailing who would be hit. Unlike water and electricity companies, which are resigned to the tax, BT's Vallance charged that it would be ""perverse"" to line up BT with utilities for punishment. ""We're not a monopoly, not a utility, heavily regulated, have very low call charges, an excellent customer service record, we're very important for the UK in getting jobs in the information society that we're in at the moment and therefore why tax us?"" he asked. But he said BT would not pull out of its ""superhighway"" agreement with Labour, whereby it will wire up for free schools and hospitals. It is hoping for an early release from a ban on using its main network for broadcasting. While BT was in a fighting mood, it also threw a challenge to its industry regulator Oftel. BT accuses Oftel of suggesting ""unduly harsh"" curbs on the prices BT charges rivals for carrying calls on its network. Oftel has published a consultation paper suggesting that a basket of so-called ""interconnect"" prices should fall between 6-12 percent below the rate of inflation. But finance director Robert Brace told reporters that even the lower end of this range was too harsh -- on top of a one-off price cut of 10-20 percent -- and would harm infrastructure investment in Britain. ""In extremis, we would be prepared to challenge it (the price regime) at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,"" he said, adding that interconnect charges in Britain were about one third of those in other countries. Thursday's results from BT, which left its shares barely changed at 450.5p, are likely to be its last in its current form. Once its ambitious $20 billion merger with its American partner MCI Communications Corp is cleared by U.S. regulators, a new company called Concert Plc, will be floated in London and New York. BT on Wednesday won approval from European regulators for what is the biggest transatlantic merger in history. With final approval expected in autumn, Concert will be the second biggest company in terms market value on the London stock exchange. Andrew Harrington, analyst at Salomon Brothers, says Concert appears to be the best positioned global carrier in a rapidly consolidating telecoms industry. But he warns that 50 percent of BT's revenues and 66 percent of its profits depend on an increasingly competitive domestic business. BT, which raised total dividends 6.l percent to 19.85p, said despite fierce price wars it was increasing its domestic market share amid a strong growth in demand for its products and services. But price cuts in the year came to 840 million pounds -- nearly six percent of its 14.9 billion pound turnover. BT maintained its inland call volume growth at seven percent although annual international call volume growth slipped a touch -- also to seven percent. A strengthening pound also hit BT's international call sales. Together with a 14 percent price cut in the year, international turnover fell 8.6 percent, BT said.

"British supermarket retailer J. Sainsbury Plc tried to steal a march on its competitors on Friday by launching insurance products through its Homebase do-it-yourself subsidiary. The deal, which sees Sainsbury teaming up with brokers Willis Corroon, will offer home and contents insurance, garden insurance and personal accident insurance with details to be released to the public in early February. Sainsbury became the first supermarket to announce plans to break into banking in October when it teamed up with Bank of Scotland to set up Sainsbury's Bank, which awaits a licence from UK authorities. The insurance service will be offered to all Homebase customers which are thought to total around 12 million, with initial marketing aimed at the unit's two million loyalty card holders. The service will be provided by a panel made up of Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, Guardian Royal Exchange, Norwich Union, Eagle Star and Lloyds of London. ""We believe that the Homebase brand values can make a real difference in the home insurance market,"" Mike Samuel, Homebase head of marketing, said in a statement. Sainsbury said the major features of the products would be 250 pounds ($420.2) emergency cover, cover for home removal, Christmas, birthdays and accidental damage to televisions and satellites. In addition, discounts of over 50 pounds would be offered on Homebase security products when a policy is taken out. ""The product chosen by Sainsbury's Homebase encompasses all the expected features of home insurance but with a safety net of cover not usually available with standard market products,"" said Richard Fry, head of business development at Willis Corroon. Sainsbury shares had closed down five pence at 387.5 pence before the announcement was made. Analysts said they were encouraged when Sainsbury moved into banking as there had been concerns that it was losing more and more ground to arch-rival Tesco. Tesco was the first of the big four supermarket groups to launch a loyalty card and its success forced Sainsbury to bring out its own version around a year later in June 1996. Safeway also has a loyalty card while ASDA is now testing its own version in selected stores. Meanwhile Tesco has added a ClubCard Plus credit account for customers while Safeway teamed up with high-street bank Abbey National in November to offer banking services through its ABC loyalty card.

"Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that improving the regulation of beleaguered Czech capital markets was on his agenda, but he took a shot at critics who have said the improvement was coming too slowly. Speaking at a banking and finance forum in Prague, Klaus said that ""we are searching for new forms of regulations"". ""But I disagree with those critics, mostly foreigners, who look at the existing quality of our capital markets and are surprised that they do not equal Wall Street, the City of London or any other well-established western financial centre yet,"" Klaus told the conference. ""Their high-brow attitude and and their absolutist, almost doctrinal phraseology"" does not help much, he said. However Klaus, a professor of economics and fierce anti-regulation campaigner, added that finding the right extent of capital market regulation was an ""imminent task"". Many foreign equity analysts and investors frequently criticise the Czech markets for a lack of quality company information and clear pricing of shares, insider trading, and poor oversight of numerous investment funds. Many analysts use Poland and its more stringent capital market regulation as an example of why the Warsaw Stock Exchange attracts much more foreign investment than Prague. Separately, Klaus said that the country had too many banks and investment funds, and many were poorly managed. A crisis in small private banks peaked last year when Agrobanka, the fifth largest and the largest fully-private bank, was put under forced administration by the central bank, the last and largest in a dozen recent interventions. Klaus said a liberal approach to granting banking and capital markets licences in the early 1990's came from the need for more private financial houses and competition, and nobody knew what the right number of institutions would be. ""We have too many banks and too many investment funds now, and we also know that not all of them function perfectly or are in the best possible hands,"" Klaus said. The Finance Ministry's capital markets oversight office has recently stepped up its activity with a wave of actions against illegal asset-stripping by managers of mostly smaller Czech investment funds. But the ministry is still under fierce criticism from investors and the media for a lack of activity. Klaus has revealed a plan to gradually separate capital market supervision from the Finance Ministry, a process which was started in February by creating a separate Securities Bureau within the ministry. Under the plan, the Czech Securities Registry started publishing over-the counter trades registred at the centre earlier this year. Klaus also admitted that a period at the start of the privatisation process in the early 1990's when state firms were not yet privatised led to a loss of many assets as state supervision relaxed but new owners were still not in place. ""This is something what the future privatising countries should avoid,"" Klaus told the conference. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"Rising corruption, declining English standards and an erosion in the overall quality of life cloud Hong Kong's future under China, the British Chamber of Commerce in the territory said on Thursday. A survey of 196 British businesses operating in Hong Kong revealed key uncertainties for British business after the July 1 transition to Chinese sovereignty, despite an overall air of confidence in the future. Half of those surveyed expected the rule of law to deteriorate, 72 percent forecast a decline in the quality of English and 85 percent were bracing for a rise in corruption. ""The overall message is one of British business confidence in Hong Kong, but that should be tempered by the realisation that business confidence is fragile,"" British chamber president Patrick Paul told reporters. ""Hong Kong has competitors within the region, such as Singapore and other locations, and I don't think Hong Kong can afford to be complacent,"" he said. The survey revealed broad satisfaction with Hong Kong's communications network, its taxation and legal systems and its level of education. But dissatisfaction surfaced in the costs of doing business, poor Sino-British relations and standards of English. Looking to the future, most British businesses were optimistic about increased access to China, and they anticipated improvement in Sino-British trade as soon as handover-related hurdles were overcome. But business costs, availability of skilled labour, English standards, quality of life and maintenance of the rule of law were all highlighted as sources of concern. Echoing other surveys of ordinary Hong Kong people, a possible rise in corruption was by far the greatest source of worry associated with the return to Chinese sovereignty. ""The concern is whether or not that independent approach to dealing with corruption will be maintained,"" said chamber of commerce executive director Christopher Hammerbeck. Paul said concerns about corruption flowing across the Chinese border into Hong Kong were offset by a highly transparent system that would quickly reveal any tampering, as well as an alert international business community. ""The British business community and the international business community will be watching,"" he said. ""If corruption becomes so bad that Hong Kong becomes a bad place for business -- I don't believe it will happen, but if it does -- business will doubtless vote with its feet."" Even with a small rise in corruption, Hong Kong would remain one of the least-corrupt areas in Asia, he said. Hammerbeck admitted that, as well as pollution, possible post-1997 discrimination against the British played a role in expectations of a deterioration in quality of life. ""It is a concern but that's not to say it will happen,"" he said. ","SarahDavison"
"Hong Kong's democracy movement on Friday likened Beijing's plans to curb civil liberties in the territory to the brutal purges of China's radical 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. The pro-democracy camp staged a small but noisy protest on Friday morning at the office of post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa, who will succeed British Governor Chris Patten after the handover at midnight on June 30. ""Protect freedom of assembly. Protect freedom of association,"" they shouted. ""Human rights cannot be infringed upon."" A handful wore tall hats and hung labels around their necks, harking back to the Cultural Revolution when those who were politically persecuted were forced to wear dunce caps and hang boards around their necks with their names crossed out. They were paraded through the streets and beaten. Many died. Pro-democracy activists are campaigning against plans to scrap or amend 25 Hong Kong laws, some of them crucial to civil liberties, on July 1. Laws facing the axe include parts of the Bill of Rights and laws allowing freedom of assembly and association. The Hong Kong group called for an all-night sit-down protest outside China's de facto embassy, the Xinhua News Agency branch office, opposite the Happy Valley race course. Other protests were planned for Sunday. ""I don't think we can be masters of our own house,"" Yeung Sum, deputy leader of the Democratic Party, told reporters when asked what the latest developments boded for the autonomy that China has promised Hong Kong after the handover. ""The Chinese Communist Party is master of the house, and Mr Tung is the servant of the Chinese Communist party,"" he said. Democratic Party leader Martin Lee called a news conference for later in the day and was due to set off on an eight-nation tour of Europe on Sunday to lobby for support for human rights, freedom and democracy in post-handover Hong Kong. The reduction of civil liberties was proposed by a China-controlled committee last Sunday and would be implemented by a provisional legislature that China is installing in July to replace the elected Legislative Council. The provisional body was to convene for its first sitting across the border in the Chinese city of Shenzhen on Saturday, when it is to elect its president and set rules of procedure. Britain is handing Hong Kong back to China, after more than 150 years of colonial rule, under a 1984 treaty in which China promised to preserve the territory's capitalist system and freewheeling way of life for a further half century. Hong Kong's leading English-language newspaper, the South China Morning Post, voiced concern that the changes would scrap a habeas corpus law that curbs police rights to detain people. ""It prevents people from being arbitrarily arrested and held without trial, or detained without good reason,"" the newspaper said. ""Habeas corpus is one of the greatest safeguards to individual liberty in the canon of law."" Tung and Patten duelled verbally on Thursday. Tung defended the changes, saying they were necessary to strike ""the right balance between individual rights and social order"". Tung said other states required permits for demonstrations and set limits on the overseas links of political groups, two of the changes that are worrying the pro-democracy camp. Patten heaped scorn on the proposals, which have drawn Britain and the United States into a new diplomatic quarrel with Beijing. China has rejected their protests as ""unwise"". ","PeterHumphrey"
"Boeing on Monday scrapped plans to build a new, larger version of its 747 jumbo jet in the near future, saying market conditions do not currently justify the risk and expense, estimated at more than $7 billion. Instead, the Seattle-based company plans to focus its development efforts at coming up with new versions of its medium-sized 767 and 777 twinjets, executives said. The decision, announced late in the day, marks an end to more than three years of research that included a joint study by Boeing and partner companies in its European rival, Airbus Industrie into a double-decker jet with room for 600 to 800 passengers. Boeing's move to sharply scale back its so-called 747-X program leaves Airbus alone in the market with a proposed all-new superjumbo plane that could seat 600 passengers, compared with 416 in a typical three-class configuration for the current-generation 747-400. But analysts have expressed skepticism that Airbus would be able to raise the funding needed to build such a jet. Airbus executives say their superjumbo, dubbed the A-3XX, could be built for $7 billion, but industry sources put the cost at closer to $15 billion. ""If Airbus is going to launch a big airplane, they're going to have to fund it privately,"" said Bill Whitlow, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in Seattle. ""With Boeing throwing in the towel, it's going to make it that much more difficult for them to convince investors that it's worthwhile."" In a news release, Boeing commercial airplane group President Ron Woodard said the manufacturer would leave some employees on the 747-X program to continue to study a possible larger version of the four-engine plane. ""This remains one of the priorities of our product development efforts,"" he said. ""When the market develops for such an airplane, we will be ready."" John Hayhurst, vice president and general manager for the 747-X, said about 1,000 people had been working on the program, more than half of whom will be shifted into new 767 and 777 models. Hayhurst said the decision to focus on the smaller wide-body jets reflects the company's conclusion that trans-Pacific air traffic increasingly will shift away from larger hub cities and toward more thinly traveled city pairs. ""We think there's going to be increasing fragmentation on long-haul routes, and less dependence on hubs,"" he said. ""That will require airplanes of the 767 and 777 size."" Boeing market projections foresee a demand for no more than 470 jets with 500 seats or more over the next 20 years, which is unlikely to be sufficient to produce an acceptable return to shareholders on the investment needed to design a larger wing and make other changes for the proposed 747 derivatives, Hayhurst said. Whitlow said Boeing could reduce the market demand for new large jets even further by enhancing its line of medium-sized jets. For example, Boeing has announced plans for a stretched version of the 777 that would seat 400 people, nearly as many as the 747. Another version being proposed would have a range of 10,000 miles (16,000 km), more than any other commercial jet, allowing an airline to fly between city pairs such as Singapore and Los Angeles or Hong Kong and Chicago.

"The Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday it approved Time Warner Inc.'s $6.5 billion purchase of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. after the deal was restructured to meet antitrust laws. The FTC, in a 3-2 vote, agreed to permit the revised transaction after the agency had alleged the original merger proposal would have allowed Time Warner unilaterally to raise cable-TV prices and limit the choice of programmes. The two commissioners who voted against the agreement -- Mary Azcuenaga and Roscoe Starek -- said there was no reason to order the deal to be restructured in the first place because it did not violate antitrust laws. Once formally completed, the merger would create the world's largest media and entertainment concern. The Federal Communications Commission is expected soon to give its approval. Time Warner and Turner have scheduled separate meetings for Oct. 10 to allow their shareholders to approve the transaction, first announced nearly a year ago. In response to FTC charges, the merger was restructured to curb cable-TV giant Tele-Communications Inc.'s influence over the new company that is to be formed. TCI, the nation's largest cable-TV operator, now owns 21 percent of Turner stock and would own about 7.5 percent of a combined Time Warner-Turner under the merger, said the FTC. Time Warner is the No. 2 cable-TV operator. Under the FTC accord, TCI must spin off its Turner stake to shareholders of Liberty Media Corp., a TCI subsidiary. The spin-off is contingent on a tax-free ruling from the government. Otherwise, TCI's stake would be capped at a 9.2 percent non-voting interest in Time Warner. TCI's chief, John Malone, and other top TCI officials would be barred from participating in the management of the new Liberty Media corporate entity that is to control the shares. The accord requires Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel to compete with Turner's Cable News Network. It also bars Time Warner from discriminating in how much it charges competitors for Turner programmes. ""This settlement would preserve competition and protect consumers from higher cable service prices and reduced programming choices by ensuring that competing cable operators, new technologies and future programmers can gain access to Time Warner/Turner's customers and programming,"" said FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky. Aside from being the No. 2 cable-TV operator, Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. movie studios and Time, People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines. In addition to CNN, Turner also owns film and TV studios, a cartoon cable-TV channel and the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks sports teams. ""We're disappointed that the FTC didn't block the overall deal,"" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Unions. But he added that he was ""encouraged"" by certain provisions of the agreement ""that should limit anti-competitive behaviour."" ","RogerFillion"
"Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s. said on Thursday it had agreed with Czech steelmaker Trinecke Zelezarny a.s. to cooperate in steel production and privatisation projects. Skoda said the deal would help make the ailing Czech steel industry more efficient through coordinating the modernisation of production in complementary areas. Skoda, which makes heavy iron finished and semi-finished goods, said in a statement from its headquarters in Plzen that both companies would specialise and coordinate in unspecified areas of production, aiming to cut costs. Skoda's spokesman Karel Samec said selected products would be manufactured in the cheaper of the two mills. ""This scheme will also be used in the future in other companies,"" Samec said in a statement. ""Cooperation and... participation in privatisation is necessary, bearing in mind the current stagnation of the steel production in the world."" Samec declined to specify which privatisation projects Skoda had under consideration. The Industry and Trade Ministry plans to sell 19 percent stakes of the 67 percent it holds in two other steel firms -- Nova Hut a.s. and Vitkovice a.s. The plan has yet to be approved by the full cabinet. Trinecke Zelezarny, one of the four biggest steelmills located in the northeastern town of Trinec, was partially privatised through a direct sale of a 51 percent stake to a domestic investment group and the government's voucher scheme. A steel industry source told Reuters on Thursday that Skoda, which has rapidly acquiried companies in the post-Communist era, was also considering acquiring the troubled Poldi Ocel steel mill west of Prague. Skoda's Samec told Reuters he ""was not aware"" of any plans that would lead to Skoda acquisitions in Nova Hut or Vitkovice, and that ""it was too early to talk about other projects"". The government in 1993 agreed to sell a controlling stake in Poldi to the small Czech company, Bohemia Art which has never fully paid for its majority interest. Production in Poldi came to a halt earlier this year because the company was not able to pay its energy bills. Skoda was involved in inconclusive talks earlier this year on bailing out Poldi. Bankruptcy cases against Poldi are slowly moving through the courts. Skoda, based in the western city of Plzen, makes everything from drink cans to trolleybuses and nuclear components and has shown a large appetite for acquisitions. It is no longer affiliated with the car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","JanLopatka"
"Western Resources Inc. on Wednesday offered to buy ADT Ltd. in a $3.5 billion cash and stock transaction that would transform the Kansas utility into the nation's top provider of electronic security services. The move marks the latest step in Western's aggressive strategy to dominate the highly fragmented security industry, which has grown increasingly attractive to utilities and telecommunication companies. Topeka, Kansas-based Western Resources, which already holds a 27 percent stake in ADT, said it would take its unsolicited offer directly to ADT shareholders. It also said it would call a special meeting of shareholders to replace the existing ADT board of directors. ""We have demonstrated our belief in ADT's future through our investment. The benefits of this transaction are compelling, offering a natural extension of our respective businesses,"" Western Resources Chairman John Hayes said in a statement. Hayes advised ADT of its offer in a letter in which he noted that ADT previously said it was not interested in a transaction with Western Resources. ""Now, after careful study and consideration, we have determined that the potential benefits to ADT, Western Resources and ADT's other shareowners from a combination of Western Resources and ADT are simply too compelling to ignore,"" Hayes wrote to ADT Chairman Michael Ashcroft. ""We firmly believe that this combination will provide significant benefits to our respective shareowners, customers and employees not available to either company on its own."" Western said it would pay $22.50 for each share of ADT, consisting of $15 in Western Resources common stock and $7.50 cash. The offer would give ADT holders a 12 percent premium over Tuesday's closing stock price of $20.125 on NYSE. ADT climbed $2.625 to $22.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Western Resources' stock was unchanged at $31.25. Western's proposal also calls for ADT shareholders to receive the equivalent of a 99 cents per ADT share annual dividend. ADT does not presently pay a dividend. Boca Raton, Fla.-based ADT said it would review the offer in due course and advised shareholders to await a recommendation from its board. The offer for ADT marks the second security acquisition proposal made this week by Western Resources. On Monday, Western Resources announced plans to buy the security business of Westinghouse Electric Corp. for $368 million in cash. Long considered a premier property in the electronic security industry, ADT earlier this year was to be acquired by Republic Industries Inc. for $5 billion. But that transaction collapsed in September after months of uncertainty due to stock price volatility. Western Resources has been aggressively pursuing deals in other areas. It has mounted a $1.9 billion takeover bid for Kansas City. Mo.-based Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. Last week, Western Resources agreed to sell its natural gas assets to Oklahoma-based Oneok Inc. in a $660 million deal in which Western Resources will take a large stake in Oneok, the parent of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. The utility's customers could become clients for Western Resources' other services, such as home security. ","RobinSidel"
"Teasing the automotive world with a glimpse of possible product offerings for the turn of the century, Chrysler Corp on Sunday unveiled five concept cars that appear ready for production, including two new versions of its Jeep Wrangler sport/utility vehicle. The vehicles, which also include a new Dodge roadster based on the Plymouth Prowler chassis, an affordable Neon-based small car with a roll-back top, and a 1940s-style ""dual-cowl"" convertible, are design studies for future vehicles that could be put into production within three years, said Thomas Gale, Chrysler's new product development chief. ""We've made no decision to take any of these to market,"" he said. However Chrysler will be listening closely to consumer reaction to the vehicles on this year's auto show circuit. In the past, positive public reaction has prompted Chrysler to put several concept cars into volume production, including the Dodge Viper roadster, first shown in 1989. Chrylser's Plymouth Prowler retro-roadster, which goes on sale this year, also first began life as a concept car in 1993. This year's crop of concept cars, unveiled at the start of Detroit's North American International Auto Show, include: -- Jeep Wrangler Dakar, a four-door hard-top version of the Wrangler sport/utility vehicle. Decked out with a safari-style roof rack that holds a spare tire, a winch on the front end and spare fuel cans on the rear, the vehicle appears ready for an African wildlife filming expedition. Based on the existing Wrangler hardware, the vehicle also may be the easiest to produce. ""Personally, I think there's a huge opportunity with something like that car,"" Gale said. --Jeep Icon, a design study for an all-new successor to the curent Wrangler. The Icon features a lighter, unitized body construction that would offer better fuel efficiency than the current model and an all new drive train, but it retains much of the Wrangler's classic styling cues. -- Dodge Copperhead, a two-seat roadster reminiscient of classic sports cars of the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Copperhead uses the chassis from the Prowler and is designed to be a more affordable car that could compete with BMW's $30,000 Z3 roadster. ""Copperhead will fit comfortably into any sports car enthusiast's garage -- and budget,"" said Chrysler design chief John Herlitz -- Plymouth Pronto, a plastic-bodied hatchback designed to be a roomy, affordable car with style. The vehicle, based on the Neon chassis, features a front end that evokes the retro look of the Prowler, a design theme that will make its way into more Plymouth products, Gale said. To cut costs Chrysler designed body panels with molded-in color and do not need to be painted. -- Chrysler Phaeton, a high-style luxury convertible that recalls the automaker's grand touring cars of the 1940s and '50s. Taking cues from wood-hulled motor boats of the 1940s, the car has two cowls, with the back seat separated from the front. Powered by a V-12 engine and equipped with a retractible hard top, the Phaeton is the most ambitious the concept cars and is part of an effort to add cachet to the automaker's flagship Chrysler brand. Gale said projects like the Phaeton allow designers to stretch their minds without risking much investment from shareholders. ""Other than the Phaeton, four out of the five look like they'll see production at some point,"" said Lehman Brothers auto analyst Joseph Phillippi, who attended the unveilings on Sunday. He added that he believes Chrysler will remain ahead of its competition in product innovation, which allowed it to gain market share and achieve record sales of 2.45 million vehicles in 1996. ""The stuff that these guys do is innovative and really is exciting,"" Phillippi said. The concept cars were the first of scores of production vehicles and design studies to be introduced by major automakers at the show over the next three days. Sport/utility vehicles, minivans and sports cars are expected to dominate the show. ","DavidLawder"
"Retailers are expected to post sales gains in the single digits for March, bolstered by low-end discount stores sales while department store performance was nearly flat compared with a year ago. ""It appears there's a slowdown in the department store end of the business, but the discounters are still doing well,"" Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said. Overall, he expects comparable-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be up about 5 percent or slightly less. An early Easter could depress sales at stores that were closed on the holiday, which fell in the March selling period instead of April this year. Winter storms in much of the northern part of the nation may have also held sales back. ""You need to look at March and April overall to get comparable sales,"" William Armstrong, an analyst at Fahnestock &amp; Co. Inc. said of quirks in the reporting calendar, where some retailers include Easter in March and others in April this year. Armstrong is expecting overall retail sales for March to increase by 2 percent to 4 percent. Most retailers will report March sales early Thursday. But Plano, Tex.-based J.C. Penney Co. Inc. Tuesday reported a 3.7 percent decline in comparable-store sales at its JCPenney stores in March. The early report was due to a debt offering the company is making this week. The loss of one day's sales because of Easter hurt sales, J.C. Penney said. Penney's decline is expected to be mirrored by other department stores, analysts said. ""Most (department store) chains saw flat or even slightly lower comparable sales during the March period, as they compared with healthy year-ago increases,"" analysts at Montgomery Securities wrote in a research report. They added that the early Easter and snowstorms in the Northeast added to pressure on sales. At the same time, discount stores are expected to post 4 percent to 6 percent sales gains, with low-end discounters reporting low double-digit gains, Montgomery said. ""We continue to believe the low-end strata is benefitting from the fruits of a fully-employed economy and the direct pay-hike from the 1996 minimum wage increase,"" Montgomery's analysts wrote. Among the major chains, analysts see Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, reporting same-store sales gains of about 7 percent. Sears, Roebuck and Co. was expected to report gains of 2 percent to 3 percent, with Kmart Corp. up 10 percent to 12 percent. Kmart's results are expected to be driven by seasonal items, such as horticulture, home goods and bicycles. But it will give back some of those gains in April because of the calendar shift, analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a research note. Kmart stores were open on Easter, analysts added. Dayton Hudson Corp. is expected to post a 1 percent to 2 percent gain, with a 3 percent to 4 percent increase at its Target discount stores offsetting flat department store sales. Federated Department Stores Inc. is expected to post flat sales, with some planned promotions moved into April, analysts said. ","BradDorfman"
"One year after Chrysler Corp. stunned traditional car dealers by granting a new car franchise to the CarMax auto superstore chain, a senior Chrysler executive said Sunday the move has been a success. ""We think Car Max represents us well,"" said Tom Pappert, vice president of sales and service for Chrysler. Pappert, who spoke to reporters at the National Automobile Dealers Association annual convention here, said competing dealers near the Norcross, Ga., Chrysler/Dodge CarMax dealership have begun to emulate many of CarMax's practices such as money-back guarantees and more generous warranties. ""It takes all of the guess work out of the used car process, and that's exactly what needs to happen,"" he said, noting the dealership has added new business and not stolen it from other Chrysler dealers. Chrysler, the first of Detroit's Big Three to ally itself with one of the new superstores, has no plans to expand any more with CarMax, Pappert said. CarMax is a unit of Circuit City Stores Inc.. Like other automakers, Chrysler has a limit on the number of separate dealership storefronts a single owner can have, although exceptions are granted. The company limits owners to 10 separate dealerships in the country, six in a given regional sales zone, and two in a metropolitan area. But Chrysler has adopted some of the superstore techniques at three new facilities being built in Texas, Maryland and Massachusetts. The stores will give as much exposure to used cars as new cars typically get. They will be set up in a mall-type layout and feature a personal greeter, child playrooms and a cafe. The superstore concept, as well as dealerships owned by publicly traded companies, have been a source of concern voiced by dealers attending the convention, according to officials at both Chrysler and Ford Motor Co.. However, Pappert said the capital that publicly traded companies have access to can help dealers who find their profits squeezed by increasingly thin margins. Profits are likely to come under even more pressure as more buyers use the Internet to research and purchase vehicles, said Pappert. He cited a Boston Consulting group study that forecast 25 percent of new vehicle sales will be over the Internet by 2000, adding he believes it will be higher than that. ""It's going north -- not south,"" Pappert said. Separately, Ford Division General Manager Ross Roberts said the automaker has had discussions superstore groups, but has not reached any other letters of understanding like the agreement it signed recently with Republic Industries Inc., which owns the AutoNation USA chain. Under the agreement announced in December, AutoNation can submit proposals to acquire existing Ford or Lincoln-Mercury dealerships. The pact also covers areas that Ford does not have dealerships and wants to start one. Roberts said Ford has talked with large groups that do not meet the automaker's financial, territorial and cooperative standards. ","ToddNissen"
"Britain's largest retail financial services group, Lloyds TSB, on Friday reported a 52 percent surge in 1996 profits, but analysts said the figure was somewhat flattering and included lower than expected bad debt provisions. Pretax profits in the first full year following the merger between Lloyds Bank and TSB rose to 2.505 billion pounds ($4.1 billion), and the bank, which has been the star performer in a booming British banking sector, said ""the best is yet to come."" ""We had a good year in 1996 but the combination of Lloyds, TSB and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is not fully into its swing,"" Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Brian Pitman told reporters at a news conference."" Pitman expects cost savings of 400 million pounds every year from the merger and from the purchase of the 38 percent minority interest in Lloyds Abbey Life completed last year. The 1996 profit figure followed 1.650 billion pounds the previous year. Lloyds TSB raised its dividend by 20 percent to 13.2 pence per share from 11p, while earnings per share soared by 63 percent to 31.2p from 21.3. But banking analysts said the headline data flattered the bank's underlying performance somewhat and expressed some concern for future income growth. Lloyds shares eased 7p to 485 but later improved to stand a net 2p higher by 1600 GMT at 504p. ""There's nothing really wrong with the results,"" said John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. ""But they are not as glorious as they look on the surface."" Analysts pointed out that the large drop in bad debt provisions -- 44 percent down to 327 million pounds -- was a surprise, even though some improvement was expected given that the bank has increased higher quality assets such as mortgages. ""Bad debts were much lower than expected,"" said Nick Collier, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, ""and there was a bigger return from problem country debt."" Specific provisons for bad and doubtful debts were down to 357 million from 459 million pounds in 1995 while profit from its problem country debt portfolio, mainly in Latin America, jumped to 127 million from 50 million. Leonard and Panmure Gordon analyst David Poutney both said they would likely not be increasing their profit forcasts for 1997 which stand at 2.825 billion pounds and 2.94 billion respectively. But Poutney, who has been advising clients to hold the shares but take profits, said he was now a seller. ""Overall, they are good figures but then it comes down to the valuation of the shares,"" Poutney said, ""and they are looking a bit expensive. I can't see them making much headway from here."" Lloyds said it made a restructuring provision of 75 million pounds following its purchase of insurer Lloyds Abbey Life and said it was raising its provision against possible redress from the mis-selling of pensions by 29 million pounds to 200 million, a move welcomed as prudent by analysts. Pitman said Lloyds was comparing itself with the ""best U.S. companies"" such as Coca Cola and GE and like them has adopted the ""economic profit"" measure as the best guide to its performance as it reflects growth in investment and return. Broadly speaking, economic profit represents the difference between earnings on a company's equity and the equity cost. Lloyds TSB said that, after excluding restructuring provisions, economic profit for 1996 was 69 percent higher at 1.055 million pounds compared with 623 million in 1995. Pitman said the bank is likely to spend surplus capital on growth, both organic and by aquisition, or increasing dividends rather than on buying back shares like some of its competitors. Pitman said shareholders had urged the bank not to buy back shares but to continue to provide them with high returns. ""Our capital ratios are greatly restored,"" Pitman said, ""and if we can, we would like to continue to grow (both) organically and by acquisition and increase dividends.""

"A former justice minister said on Monday that Colombia's moves to lift a six-year extradition ban were a smokescreen designed to appease the United States while protecting the country's drug barons. ""This government has no real desire to push extradition through but it wants to give the impression that it does ... We must not underestimate (President Ernesto) Samper's bad faith and capacity for trickery,"" former justice minister Enrique Parejo told Reuters. Samper reiterated on Monday his commitment to seeing an end to the constitutional ban on sending Colombians to stand trial abroad, saying ""it forms part of our policies in the international struggle against drugs"". But Parejo believes Samper is merely paying lip service to the idea of extradition to placate the United States, which blacklisted Colombia for a second consecutive year for its perceived failure to crack down on drug trafficking. A Senate committee is due to re-open a government- sponsored debate on extradition on Tuesday following a confusing session last week, which ended in a hung vote and left legislators and ministers arguing over congressional rules. Even if one of three extradition proposals due for debate clears all congressional hurdles and makes it onto the statute books, Parejo believes it would be so complex as to be unworkable. The alternatives range from the simple abrogation of Article 35 from the constitution -- the one banning extradition of Colombian nationals -- to one that includes widespread restrictions on when extradition could be applied. ""This is all part of a manoeuvre by the government. Even if some form of extradition is passed then it will really amount to nothing because there will be so many regulations that these would frustrate the whole process,"" Parejo said. Extradition was banned in 1991 after Pablo Escobar, the late head of the notorious Medellin drug cartel, launched a spate of bombings and kidnappings against the state. When Samper took office in August 1994, amid allegations that he financed his election campaign with donations from the Cali drug mob, he said restoration of extradition was not on his political agenda. Samper and his top ministers have reversed that position in the face of increasing pressure from the United States, which has consistently pressed for extradition of the jailed Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, former chiefs of the notorious Cali cartel. But Parejo believes Samper is now giving verbal backing to the restoration of extradition safe in the knowledge that Colombian law makes it virtually impossible to apply new legislation retroactively.

"WMX Technologies Inc chairman and acting chief executive Dean Buntrock should stay on the job long enough to find a new CEO, then step down, said Nell Minow, a principal at Lens Inc, a major WMX stockholder. In an interview with Reuters, Minow said, ""Any successor worth his salt is not going to want the job if (Buntrock) is going to be too involved ... It doesn't have to be right away, but I think (Buntrock) should recognize that."" Buntrock, 65, founded Oak Brook, Ill.-based WMX and was chief executive from 1968 until June 1996.   At that time, Buntrock was replaced as chief executive by Phillip Rooney, formerly WMX chief operating officer. On Tuesday, Rooney resigned, just a week after his ouster was demanded by an investment group controlled by financier George Soros, another major shareholder of WMX. Earlier this month, under shareholder presssue, WMX named John Sanford as its new chief financial officer. Formerly WMX treasurer, he replaced James Koenig, who became executive vice president. Minow said Lens is dissatisfied with Sanford. ""The new one I would like to see reassigned, as well, or gone,"" Minow said. ""They need to bring in an outsider.""   Lens and other shareholders are unhappy with the WMX CFO's office, according to Minow. ""It's their inability to meet their projections, their inability to let a year go by without some special charge, that I think speaks very badly for the credibility of that office, to say nothing of (WMX's) muddled, overall structure,"" she said. Regarding the search for a new CEO, Minow said, ""We'd like to see someone who's got a proven track record in a turnaround situation. We want to see someone who's willing to put his money where his mouth is by being willing accept most of his pay in options.""   Shares in WMX were down 3/4 to 34 at midday following its announcement that it agreed to sell its entire 19-percent stake in ServiceMaster LP for $626 million in cash. WMX is undertaking a broad restructuring meant to appease shareholders and refocus the company on its core business, but its efforts so far have done little to silence its critics. The continuing battle between the company and the closely allied Soros and Lens groups is centering on board control. WMX spokesman William Plunkett said four of 12 board seats will come open at the May 9 annual meeting. The Soros group has named a slate of four individuals it would like to see elected. Minow said Lens supports the Soros slate. Plunkett said WMX expects Buntrock and director Peer Pedersen to stand for reelection, leaving two seats up for grabs. ""The nominating committee is actively reviewing candidates now ... They welcome suggestions from all our shareholders,"" Plunkett said. Regarding Minow's comments on the CFO, Plunkett said, ""John Sanford has been in this job very briefly and he is an experienced financial executive. He is well regarded among our investors and is actively engaged in the process of enhancing shareholder value."" He declined further comment. ((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787)) ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"The criminal complaint filed against Nomura Securities Co Ltd on Tuesday reveals a widening circle of players in a pay-off scandal that has rocked the firm, dashing its hopes for a quick end to the affair. Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors alleging that Nomura, two former executives and a former general manager compensated a client for investment losses, government sources said. The sources said what was unusual about the latest scandal were revelations that company executives had asked junior staff to conduct illegal deals to compensate clients for stock trading losses for a long time. But the securities watchdog decided not to take action against the junior staffers involved in the illegal deals, the sources said. ""The SESC decided not file a complaint against Nomura staff who had been actually involved in the transactions,"" a government source said. Besides the brokerage, the SESC took action against former Nomura directors Shimpei Matsuki and Nobutaka Fujikura, both of whom resigned on March 10 as directors after Nomura's internal probe found they had made discretionary deals banned under Japanese securities law and funnelled profits to the corporate client. The other was former general manager Osamu Fujita, who made the transactions under Fujikura's orders, the sources said. They also said that Nomura continued the practice of making illegal compensation payments even after it was involved in an industry-wide loss compensation scandal in 1991. Since the scandal was revealed by Nomura itself on March 6, the company's executives, including then president Hideo Sakamaki, insisted that they believed only the two former directors were involved in the pay-offs. Sakamaki has since been forced to step down to take responsibility for the scandal. With the SESC's latest move, the focus has now shifted to when the Finance Minister will impose penalties on Nomura and how severe they will be. Analysts said that Nomura's business results for 1997/98 will depend on when and how hard the Ministry of Finance (MOF) comes down on Nomura. If administrative penalties are severe and the ramifications extend into the second half of 1997/98, Nomura may be forced to post losses in 1997/98, they said. The Japanese watchdog lacks the right to take punitive action itself but can recommend that the finance minister mete out administrative punishment and can ask prosecutors to take legal action against possible criminal violations. Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka has said that the ministry would impose strict penalties against Nomura if the SESC were to propose that administrative action be taken against the company. The sources said the securities watchdog would start drawing up its recommendations for penalties against Japan's top brokerage now that it had filed a complaint with prosecutors. However, they said it was too early to say how long it would take the SESC to present its proposals to MOF. A senior Finance Ministry official said after the scandal was revealed that MOF was focusing on whether Nomura had violated the commercial code, rather than the securities law. If the SESC investigation finds that pay-offs were made to a racketeer, the ministry will impose severe administrative penalties against Nomura, he said. However, the client at the centre of the latest Nomura scandal was not included in the complaints, as the SESC could not confirm the role of the client. In late March, prosecutors said that the client was linked to a ""sokaiya"" racketeer. Sokaiya extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting, and Japan's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to racketeers since 1982. ","FumikoFujisaki"
"The Lloyd's insurance market's ""annual venture"" - where syndicates are formed anew every year - has been criticised as costly and damaging to competitiveness in a report by accountants KPMG published on Friday. The report will form part of the submission by the Lloyd's Corporate Capital Association (LCCA) to the Lloyd's Syndicate Structure working party which is weighing the pros and cons of different capital structures for syndicates. But it will also be seen as another attack on the position of unlimited liability Names, the traditional backers of the 300 year-old insurance market, who fear they are being eased out of the market in favour of corporate investors. Only last month, Lloyd's put forward proposals to raise the amount of capital Names must pledge to back their underwriting activities. That move is likely to reduce further the number of Names at Lloyd's, already at 20-year lows. Corporate capital, first introduced in 1994, now accounts for 44 percent of the market's total capacity. KPMG puts the direct costs of the annual venture at 117 million pounds ($190 million) in an average year, more than 10 percent of the underwriting profits of the insurance market in the 1994 year of account. In addition, it argues that the indirect costs involved clearly inhibit Lloyd's syndicates in critical areas such as long-term planning, capital investment and reinsurance purchasing. This, it says, will increasingly restrict Lloyd's competitiveness internationally in areas such as the provision of multi-year insurance products and compliance with overseas regulatory standards. KPMG suggests that 58 million pounds could be saved by the abolition of members' agents who represent Names' interests. The Corporation of Lloyd's annual costs could be reduced by around 41 million pounds, it says. Antony Haynes, chairman of the LCCA which represents corporate investors, said the KPMG report ""speaks for itself."" ""Both traditional names and corporate capital providers are seeing a substantial part of their underwriting returns being eroded by a market practice of the annual venture...,"" Haynes said. But Robert Miller, spokesman for the Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM) which represents around 8,000 Names, rejected the report's conclusions. ""We are doubtful about the apportionment of the costs. Secondly what it has completely failed to take into account is that the Names significantly pay for the costs of the annual venture,"" said Miller. Names were willing to pay for the annual venture, he argued, because it allowed them to receive an income stream unrelated to other investments such as shares and to diversify their portfolios. The Lloyd's syndicate structure working party is due to publish its conclusions soon. It is one of a number set up to examine the key strategic issues facing Lloyd's which will report by the end of May. The findings will be pulled together to develop the blueprint for the market's new business plan, expected to be published in June or July. Supporters of the present system argue that a shift to corporate capital will damage the flexibility and entrepreneurial spirit of the Lloyd's market. ALM has commissioned its own independent study on the way capital is provided to Lloyd's syndicates which will provide the basis of its submission to the working party.

"Fresh from a high-court victory, Florida's anti-tobacco activists are bracing for a legislative assault on the innovative law allowing the state government to sue cigarette makers. Although bloodied by past failures to repeal the 1994 law, which undoes many of tobacco industry's best legal defenses, opponents said on Tuesday the campaign to repeal Florida's third-party medical liability act would continue through the current legislative session scheduled to last until May.   ""The fight goes on,"" said Jodi Chase, general counsel for Associated Industries of Florida Inc, an employers trade group prominent in the repeal campaign. Bills to repeal the medical-liability law have been introduced in the upper and lower houses of the Florida legislature. A repeal bill was vetoed by Gov. Lawton Chiles two years ago and an effort to override his veto failed in 1996. ""The arena now will be the Florida legislature,"" said Harold Lewis, chief inspector general for Chiles.   Lewis said the governor and allies inside and outside state government expected tobacco companies and others pushing repeal to launch a full-press media and lobbying offensive, even though some top legislators have said a vote on repeal bills was unlikely this year. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to take up a tobacco industry challenge to the constitutionality of the law but did not deal with the principal at issue in the industry's challenge and left open the possibility of considering the matter after a trial.   Lawyers for both Florida and cigarette makers said the Supreme Court action makes it even more likely that a trial in the billion-dollar lawsuit against the tobacco industry will go forward as scheduled on August 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida. A spokesman for Philip Morris, one of the defendants in the West Palm Beach case, said the company rarely discusses its lobbying efforts but that the company's lawyers were continuing to prepare for trial. Lewis said 60 or more lobbyists were working against the bill and that he expected millions of dollars to be spent by the repeal forces.   A group working with Chiles, the Coalition to Clear the Air for Florida Taxpayers, is preparing a media and organizing campaign to support the law, according to executive director Beth Labasky. The group, composed of health organizations and school groups, is calling its campaign, ""Tobacco: Florida's Public Enemy Number One"", and expects to spend under $1 million on advertising, consultant Ron Sachs said. Smith Barney tobacco-industry analyst Martin Feldman said a constitutional challenge to the Florida law was highly likely to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court if cigarette makers lose in the West Palm Beach trial. ""The Supreme Court has specifically provided the option of considering the industry's claim at a date in the future, and quite possibly as part of an appeal -- should that prove necessary,"" Feldman said in a written report. -- Miami newsroom, 305-374-5013 ","MichaelConnor"
"Separate divisions of Hewlett-Packard Co. will Monday unveil new products executives say will reduce the difficulties and costs of owning and operating computer networks. The products, which HP representatives said are geared to ease computing systems management while also reducing costs, include manageability tools and new additions to the company's HP Vectra line of business computers.   The Palo Alto-based company is also launching a second generation of its HP NetServer E series server devices for small and medium-size businesses which typically have little or no computer systems management staff. Computer servers are the machines which tie together networks of computers and other devices, such as printers and centralized data storage. In an additional announcement, HP's printer division said it is adding to its HP OfficeJet ""all-in-one"" line of machines which combine in one device tasks such as printing, scanning, copying and fax capabilities.   HP said its HP Vectra personal computer models will now come loaded with TopTOOLS, a new management tool provided free which enables systems managers to handle configuration, security and a variety of other tasks from any location on a computer network. TopTOOLS is part of a series of enhancements HP is preparing in an effort to reduce the cost of operating networked personal computers, which some research studies have estimated can cost up to $12,000 a year to run. The tool has a broad range of features, including the ability to remotely configure and upgrade systems, handle security features and keep an inventory of their PCs.   HP said it will also provide a sweeping upgrade of its HP Vectra personal computer lines, including models equipped with Intel Corp.'s Pentium processors with MMX technology, enhanced 10/100 Base-T LAN interface and 4.5 gigabyte Ultra SCSI hard disk drives. Its new high performance XA Pentium Pro processor HP Vectra PC models, for example, will begin at an average selling price of $2,624 for 200 Megahertz models, for example, or $3,583 with the Ultra SCSI drive.   New models of the HP Vectra VL line will include a 64- bit graphics engine and new S3 Trio64 V2 video controller for enhanced graphics. The line in various configurations will range in price from $1,235 to $1,871, HP said. The HP Vectra VA PCs will incorporate manageability features and have average prices of at $1,827 to $2,221 and the HP Vectra VE personal computers are to be value priced with expected prices in the $1,050 to $1,200 range. HP also said it will launching the second generation of its NetServer E Series, the E40 model, just six months after it introduced the line last September.   HP faces stiff competition from Compaq Computer Corp. in the space, but still reckons the top market competition is use of a generic personal computer tilted on its side and configured as a server. For this reason, HP is adding features to make the E 40 models, priced at $2,160 to $2,630 and available on April 1, extremely simple to use for a company which may have no internal systems management staff.   Elaine Lennox, worldwide E-Series product manager at HP's Network Server Division, said the machines include a simple alerting mechanism for problems and contain a remote console for resellers to fix problems remotely. ""We only tell you when there's a problem,"" said Lennox, adding each unit will be shipped with Novell Inc.'s IntranetWare for Small Business pre-installed so it can be activated using a key code if a customer wishes to add the network operating system.   HP's printer business said it is launching its OfficeJet 500 printer-fax-copier-scanner which can print black text at speeds up to four pages a minute and color documents at a rate of a page a minute. The new machine, expected to be available in May, are targeted at the small office, home office market and are expected to cost around $500 in the U.S. market. HP said it will continue to sell its OfficeJet 300 for a reduced price, about $400 in the United States.   HP is also introducing a professional multifunction printer, the OfficeJet Pro 1150C color printer-copier- scanner for about $1,000. The product can print black text at speeds up to eight pages a minute and mixed text and color documents at speeds up to four pages a minute, with copy speeds only slightly slower. It can scan color images in 10 seconds. HP is also introducing a 14-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) flat-panel PC monitor, which is expected to ship in April at an average U.S. selling price of $2,419. The sleek monitors are more energy efficient than cathode ray tube devices and are particularly useful in areas where workspace is limited, HP said.

"Australia's largest locally-owned investment bank posted a stronger than expected annual profit on Monday, citing bullish investment markets and steady flow of corporate advisory work as the driving factors. Macquarie Bank Ltd's net profit for the year to March 31 rose 25.4 percent to A$116.94 million, producing a return on average shareholder funds or equity of 25.2 percent. Macquarie raised its annual dividend to 43 cents from 36 cents a year earlier on an earnings per share rise to 74.9 cents per share from 61 cents per share.   Analysts had forecast a net profit of around A$105 million. ""All five major business groups performed well,"" Macquarie Bank Managing Director Allan Moss told a news conference. ""We were assisted by by favourable market conditions, with a good level of corporate activity and fairly strong security markets,"" he said. The Australian stock market rose 8.7 percent over the year to March 31 and 10 year bond yields fell to 8.16 percent from 8.81 percent.   Macquarie's Corporate Advisory division, which advises companies on takeovers and mergers, benefitted from an active year of corporate plays and had 130 advisory mandates, up significantly from 1995/96. Among others, Macquarie advised Placer Dome Inc on its takeover of Highlands Gold Ltd and TNT on its response to a bid by Dutch postal and telecoms group KPN NV. However, Macquarie's advisory work with TNT produced the bank's one major hiccup for the year.   One of Macquarie's most senior corporate advisory executives, Simon Hannes, was charged with insider trading last month after he allegedly bought TNT options before KPN's takeover bid and made a notional profit of A$2 million. Hannes, who was not working on the TNT project, allegedly had access to TNT documents at Macquarie. His lawyers have said he would be pleading not guilty. Moss said the Hannes matter had not affected corporate advisory work and was not expected to in the current year.   ""Our perception is that flow of business was unaffected by the Hannes matter, because our clients recognise this matter relates to an individual and not the bank as a whole,"" he said. Meanwhile, Moss and analysts said the outlook for Macquarie was as bullish as that for the market overall, due in large part to low interest rates. ""With interest rates continuing to be low and perhaps going down a little bit further, there's every prospect for a reasonably good year in equity markets and we're also seeing quite a good flow in corporate activity,"" he said.   Australian stocks have risen another eight percent since balance date, while bond markets have also strengthened further. Analysts said the result was stronger than expected. ""It's all looking fairly healthy, given the outlook for the market in general,"" said a Sydney analyst who had forecast A$110 million. Investors welcomed the result and talk of an eventual capital return, boosting Macquarie's stock four cents to A$9.50 at the close, near its A$9.60 all-time high.   Moss said an expected change to the way Macquarie's capital adequacy ratio was calculated was likely to boost its ratio to 16 percent in coming years from its current 13.2 percent, raising the possibility of a capital return through a share buy back or higher dividend payout ratio. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","BernardHickey"
"A large discrepancy between two recent statistical reports on job creation in Canada has raised questions about the depth of Canada's unemployment problem. The so-called payroll report, which measures the number of employees on business payrolls in Canada, showed the creation of 301,000 jobs in the fourth quarter of 1996. But the much-watched labor force survey showed a more depressing picture. The monthly labor force survey is a broader measure of labor markets and includes self-employed and agricultural workers, who are not on business payrolls, as well as the unemployment rate. For the fourth quarter of 1996, the labor force survey showed the creation of about 86,000 jobs -- less than a third of the new jobs in the payroll survey. While Statistics Canada officials played down the discrepancy, the numbers raised eyebrows in Ottawa, where job creation promises to be a major issue in a federal election campaign expected this spring. The governing Liberals are ready to campaign on their economic record, but are vulnerable to criticism on jobs since the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high, hovering just below 10 percent. But the two reports are apples and oranges, said Mike Sheridan, director-general of labor and household surveys at Statistics Canada. ""There's a big difference there, but why don't you look at it year over year?"" he said in a phone interview. ""The problem here is, on the short term, these two surveys don't measure the same thing."" For all of 1996, the labor force survey showed an increase of 186,000 jobs or 1.4 percent, while the payroll numbers showed an increase of 195,000 or 1.8 percent. ""Not a big difference,"" Sheridan said. ""Over short-term periods, they rarely move in sync. But over longer-term periods, they move in sync."" The labor force survey had a 20-year history, while the payroll survey was fairly new and still undergoing changes, he said. ""The payroll numbers are being improved. They're playing almost a catch-up to the labor force,"" he said. Economists said they tended to place more weight on the labor force survey than the payroll numbers, because the labor force survey gave a bigger, more up-to-date portrait of the job market. The labor force survey for March is to be released on Friday. Economists predicted the creation of 35,000 jobs, compared to a loss of 18,000 for February. They predicted a dip in the unemployment rate to 9.6 percent from the 9.7 percent at which it had been stuck in the past three months. Positive signals in the data are widely expected to encourage the Liberals to call a spring election, rather than waiting until autumn.

"AT&amp;T Corp shares were savaged on Monday as growing worries about marketing and investment costs in the hyper-competitive U.S. telecom market were reflected in earnings estimate cuts by two brokerages. AT&amp;T shares plunged 2-3/4 or 6.6 percent to 38-3/4 by late-afternoon, after Salomon Bros. and CS First Boston issued their research.  MCI Communications Corp fell 7/8 to 33 and Sprint Corp 1/2 to 39-1/2 in sympathy.   ""It is in AT&amp;T's court,"" said analyst Barry Sine of SBC Warburg.  ""The more they spend on marketing their new services for the long term, the lower 1997's results will be,"" he said. The market was particularly spooked by a sharp cut in his estimate of AT&amp;T's 1997 earnings per share by Salomon analyst Jack Grubman to $3.00 from $3.60, and to $3.25 from $3.80 for 1998.  Grubman later said his estimates may still be too high. Most analysts thought this too bearish a view.  Frank Governali of CS First Boston said he only cut his estimate of AT&amp;T's earnings to between $3.25 and $3.45 for 1997. ""Salomon's number is for a dire outcome,"" he said.   ""I would be shocked if AT&amp;T diluted its 1997 earnings down to $3.00 per share,"" said Richard Klugman of PaineWebber. First Call's analyst consensus for AT&amp;T earnings per share in 1997 is $3.68 and for 1998 $3.98 per share.  For the fourth quarter 1996 it is $0.80 and the 1996 year $3.48. AT&amp;T declined to comment on the estimate cuts, but a source close to the company said no guidance had come out of the investor relations department to drive them. ""We have not yet determined what 1997 will bring, but it is safe to say we do not agree with the more pessimistic comments,"" the source said, declining identification.   Governali said that AT&amp;T had a choice to make: ""Either to run the business for 1997, in which case they could make $3.60 per share, or to position itself for the long-term, in which case there is no way they can."" Analysts say the whole industry faces the same dilemma. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 will release the regional Bells into the long distance market place this year, on top of a horde of tiny rivals that have been nibbling away at the customers of the big three.   Though AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint can enter the local phone market, they will have to stump up hundreds of millions of dollars to to advertise their services, push their brand names and build network facilities to key business customers. Grubman's research note said that he believed AT&amp;T was losing hundreds of millions on its popular Worldnet Internet access service too, because of high costs. Analysts say MCI and Sprint have already bitten the bullet by warning analysts of increased spending, but AT&amp;T had not done so.   ""Sprint and MCI have already done it.  MCI's merger with British Telecommunications Plc is a tacit admission of that fact (that you need very deep pockets to succeed),"" Governali said. SBC Warburg's Sine said MCI told analysts it would spend an extra $200 million to $300 million this year on marketing, but the stock was not hit because it is underwritten by the value of the planned British Telecom merger, announced in November. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610 ","NickLouth"
"Franco-Italian semiconductor group SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV said on Wednesday 1996 earnings rose 19 percent to $625.5 million, but issued a warning on the first quarter of 1997 after a weak end to last year. A 15.5 percent fourth quarter drop to $142 million contrasted with a near-doubling of Intel Corp's profit in the same period. The U.S. company's report on January 14 had boosted SGS-Thomson shares on bullish expectations. SGS-Thomson's president and chief executive Pasquale Pistorio said he was pleased with the 1996 performance. But he was cautious about the first quarter of 1997, although he said the company would still outperform the industry average. ""With lead times shrinking throughout the industry, we are entering the first quarter of 1997 with less order visibility than we have historically enjoyed,"" he said in a statement. ""From what we know today, we expect 1997 first quarter revenues to be close to third quarter 1996 levels. We also anticipate that overall pricing pressures will continue, and therefore, in spite of productivity improvements, gross margins could be slightly below fourth quarter 1996 levels,"" he added. In the third quarter of 1996, net revenues were $988.4 million. ""While first quarter conditions continue to be uncertain, we believe that subsequent quarters of 1997 will show progressive improvement compared to the 1997 first quarter as the company continues to emphasise differentiated products and high growth applications,"" Pistorio added. ""Recent contracts with key customers and new design wins in such high growth areas as hard disk drives, set-top boxes and digital cellular phones give us confidence that SGS-Thomson will continue to outperform the industry average in 1997,"" he said. SGS-Thomson, whose shares are listed in Paris and New York, is 70 percent-owned by two consortia, one French and one Italian, reflecting its formation in a merger of a French and Italian microchip company. Pistorio said the 1996 results were achieved in difficult market conditions. Prices of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) have plunged and caused losses at many chipmakers. SGS-Thomson, however, does not make DRAMs but dedicated chips which shielded it somewhat from price erosion. ""Our concentration on differentiated products provided consistency to our financial results throughout a period that was characterised by industry-wide volatility,"" Pistorio said. Full year revenues rose to $4.12 billion from $3.55 billion. Capital expenditure rose to $1.12 billion from $1.0 billion and research and development spending was up by 21 percent to $532.30 million, or 12.9 percent of sales. The Le Monde newspaper recently said that French Industry Minister Franck Borotra wanted to reduce the French stake in the company, which is held by France Telecom, CEA-Industrie and Thomson-CSF.

"The Czech Republic took both reverse singles matches from India on Sunday clinching a berth in the second round of the Davis Cup, but lost its number one player, Petr Korda in the process. Jiri Novak gave the Czechs a 3-2 victory with a straight set 6-1 6-4 6-3 victory over Mahesh Bhupathi after Korda, who announced he was retiring from Davis Cup play, had brought his team level with a 5-7 6-3 6-4 6-1 win over Leander Paes. Novak barely broke a sweat against Bhupathi, who is ranked more than 400 places lower, needing just 90 minutes to dispatch the Indian number two. Jumping out to a quick start, Novak, ranked 67th in the world, took the first set 6-1 and went up 5-0 in the second before losing his rythmn, and four consecutive games. But he regrouped to hold serve in the tenth game for the set. He then broke Bhupathi twice in the third set to clinch the tie. ""This is one of the biggest matches I have won in my life,"" said an elated Novak following the match. Korda, ranked 33rd in the world, also had little trouble in his matchup with Paes, overpowering the Indian at the net and unleashing powerful groundstrokes from the baseline. He squandered five break points in the first set, while Paes, ranked 105th in the world, took advantage of the only one he had to take the first set in 53 minutes. But Korda showed no signs of a cold that has plagued him throughout the week, quickly getting back on track to take the next three sets. ""Overall though, I am still really happy both myself and the team performed,"" said Olympic bronze medalist Paes. After the win, Korda said he would no longer play for the Czechs in the Davis Cup, complaining of the demands it put on a player. ""There was a lot of pressure on me for this match, but I showed the kind of player I am,"" he said. ""I have thought about retiring (from Davis Cup) for a while and it's time to leave. It is a very tiring, draining experience and I think you should leave at the top. Now is the right time."" Korda, who was once ranked as high as fifth in the world, has been the anchor of the Czech team since his debut in 1988, compiling a 30-12 overall record, including three wins against India this weekend. The loss of Korda is the second setback for last year's semifinalists, after Czech number two Daniel Vacek bowed out of action to concentrate more on his performance on the ATP tour. ","AlanCrosby"
"The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) announced a surprisingly strong 11 percent rise in first half profits on Wednesday as a 33 percent surge in business lending more than offset a further squeeze in home loan margins. ""Business volumes during the first half of 1996/97 were pleasing, leading to a better than expected interim result,"" CBA managing director David Murray told a news conference. ""This likely to lead to a slightly better than expected full year result,"" Murray said.   CBA's net profit for the six months to December 31 rose to A$602 million from A$542 million in the comparable six months a year earlier. CBA had itself been saying until now that it expected competition in its key home loan market would squeeze home loan margins and keep profits flat in the year to June 30, 1997. Analysts too had expected a subdued profit performance, forecasting a profit of between A$535 million and A$560 million. CBA's shares rallied sharply on the profit and on news of a interim dividend of 45 cents per share, up seven cents on the previous interim dividend.   CBA's shares were up 47 cents at A$13.88 at 3.50 p.m. (0450 GMT), helping to drive the share market overall to a new record high. ""Obviously the market liked it. The profit was probably about A$50 million above expectations and there was a nice increase in the dividend,"" said Lance Jones dealer Hamish Dee. CBA said the launch of its Business Asset Finance and Capital Business Card products in July and October 1996 had attracted significant new business.   But CBA dampened optimism about its business lending boom by cutting its varible home mortgage rates by up to 0.7 of a percentage point, ensuring further margin pressure on Australia's largest home lender. ""It will narrow the margins further,"" Murray said. CBA's group net interest margin fell to 3.71 percent in the first half of 1996/96, compared with 4.12 percent and 4.10 percent respectively in the first and second halves of 1995/96. This is CBA's second unilateral home loan interest rate cut in less than a year. The bank cut its key variable home loan rate to 9.9 percent from 10.5 percent in May.   That cut triggered a round of mortgage rate cuts by the other major banks and was generally seen as the catalyst to a 50 to 75 basis point cut in big bank home loan margins. It cut its key variable rate to 7.55 percent on Wednesday. Murray was reluctant to predict that the CBA would sustain the 11 percent profit rise through the full year because of the expected margin squeeze, saying only that 1996/97 was likely to be a little better than the previously expected flat result. He said the latest home loan cuts had more to do with increasingly aggressive competition in the home loan market than with any pre-emption of another cut in official cash rates.   ""It's true that this move has got more to do with the structure of home loan interest rates in Australia than it has to do with our view about monetary policy,"" he said. CBA also said its efforts to control costs and increase productivity were a factor in the the better than expected profit. CBA's cost to income ratio fell to 60.3 percent from 60.9 percent and would have been 59.5 percent if not for CBA's buy-back of 10 percent of its shares from the government. Meanwhile the CBA confirmed that it was looking closely at securitising some of its mortgage portfolio and that it was not looking at issuing a special dividend. ","BernardHickey"
"Shareholders of MCI Communications Corp. are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposed merger with British Telecommunications Plc at MCI's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday. The shareholder vote is one of the first major milestones on the road to winning approval for the $23 billion trans-Atlantic merger, which would create a combined company known as Concert Plc with $40.6 billion in revenues. The merger awaits regulatory approvals in Washington, London and Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union. Company officials are confident the merger -- announced in November -- is on track to close in the fall of 1997. The annual meeting, to be held in Wilkes Barre, Pa., two hours north of Philadelphia, is expected to be a quiet affair, with only three items on the agenda -- the shareholder vote, and election of directors and auditors. Wilkes Barre was chosen because it was the hometown of William McGowan, the legendary founder and former chairman of MCI, who died in June 1992. Washington-based MCI is the nation's second largest long distance company. In his speech to shareholders Wednesday, Bert Roberts, MCI's current chairman and chief executive, is expected to focus on the projected benefits of its merger, which creates one of the world's first global communications carriers. One industry analyst briefed by the company said he expected Roberts to reveal some of the early products and services that may result from its ties to British Telecom. Among the possible offerings would be seamless services connecting the United States and Britain, including wireless phone transmission, faxing, electronic mail, voice mail and the Internet, the analyst said. Industry analysts believe the MCI official will also respond to AT&amp;T Corp.'s initiative to offer local phone service using a fixed wireless system attached to the side of a customer's premises as a means of bypassing local networks controlled by regional Bell companies. Through interconnection pacts and the new wireless technology, AT&amp;T has said by 1998 it plans to offer local service to the vast majority of the U.S. population. MCI made an early move into local phone markets with its MCI Metro unit, but has appeared less aggresive than its peers since the passage of the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 in evolving a strategy to expand its local phone presence. A key benefit of the merger with cash-rich British Telecom is the financing muscle that MCI can tap as MCI seeks to slice substantial market share away from the incumbent regional Bell telephone companies in various local service markets. MCI provides local service in 20 U.S. metropolitan markets through a mix of company-owned facilities and resale agreements to use other companies' networks. It has said it plans to be in 31 local service markets by the end of 1997. ","EricAuchard"
"Although a Canadian federal election is not expected to be called until this weekend, the mudslinging has already begun. Reform Party leader Preston Manning, defensive after charges of racism in his right-wing opposition party, sought to turn the tables on the rival Conservatives on Thursday. The two parties face a battle for the right-wing vote. Reform won the third most seats in its inaugural national election campaign in 1993, while the Conservatives plummeted to two seats after nine years of rule. But Reform has been haunted by accusations of racism through its 3-1/2 year term in Parliament. Questioned by reporters on Thursday about Reform's record on tolerance, Manning accused the Conservatives of choosing a candidate based on race. Manning produced a clipping from a Vancouver newspaper, which quoted a Conservative official as saying he deliberately sought election candidates who were not Sikh so the candidate could distinguish himself from the other parties' Sikh candidates. ""If we'd said that, we'd be crucified,"" Manning told the National Press Club in Ottawa. He urged the media to challenge the Tories on the comment, but denied he was mudslinging. ""I don't like any of that stuff,"" he said. A Conservative spokesman brushed off Manning's remarks as ""electioneering."" The ruling Liberals are widely expected to call an election this weekend for June 2. While recent polls predicted the Liberals would retain power, pre-election campaigning has taken on a bitter flavor, with name-calling and accusations of racism and sexism becoming more frequent. Liberal Defence Minister Doug Young was criticised recently for sexist remarks. On Tuesday, Reform member of parliament Ian McClelland called Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps a ""bitch"" in the House of Commons and was forced to withdraw his remark. Also this week, British Columbia Reform official George Rigaux resigned after saying that Sikh leaders were corrupting nominations in his riding. Conservative leader Jean Charest said on Wednesday that voters should be alarmed about charges of racism and sexism surrounding the Reform party. The Conservative and Reform parties are trying to carve out distinct images as they compete for the conservative vote. In trying to portray itself as a grassroots party, Reform has had to fend off a reputation for extremism. Last May, Reform members of parliament opposed a Liberal bill to expand rights for homosexuals. One Reform member of parliament said that if he owned a business he would move black or gay employees ""to the back of the shop"" or even fire them if their presence annoyed bigoted customers. His comments were backed by another Reform member of parliament. Both were disciplined by the Reform caucus. During the 1993 campaign, Reform had to dump a candidate after he acknowledged making anti-immigrant remarks. ","HeatherScoffield"
"Struggling computer products retailer Egghead Inc. Friday said it would close 77 of its 156 stores to focus on its most profitable locations and Internet business with a new management team. Egghead, which just last April sold the corporate sales unit that generated half its revenue, said it would take a $30 million charge against earnings in the current fiscal fourth quarter to pay for the latest restructuring. Chief Executive Officer Terry Strom and senior vice presidents Kurt Conklin and Ron Smith will leave the company, and Chairman George Orban was appointed to replace Strom, who will continue to work as a consultant, Egghead said. Egghead, which lost $10.7 million in fiscal 1996 on sales of $403.8 million and lost another $7.6 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 1997, said the reorganization would reduce its losses in fiscal 1998 by cutting almost $20 million from annual operating expenses. ""The actions approved by the board amount to a remaking of Egghead in a way that we believe should give us the opportunity to turn the company around,"" Orban said in a statement. Egghead stock, which was at nearly $14 last June, fell 62.5 cents to close at $5.375 in Nasdaq trading. Egghead, which began in 1984 as a single shop in suburban Seattle, once had more than 200 stores in a nationwide chain. But it has struggled for years as software prices have fallen and ""big box"" superstores have eaten into its market share. ""It's been one downsize after another now for as long as I can remember,"" said Scott McAdams, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie. He said it was far from clear whether Egghead, now based in Spokane, Wash., would succeed with its new strategy of concentrating on larger stores and hardware sales that would include computers and upgrade kits. ""I truly just don't know whether there's room in the world for this thing at all,"" McAdams said. Egghead's announcement comes one month after Tandy Corp. said it would shut all 17 of its Incredible Universe megastores and 19 of its 108 Computer City Stores. Egghead still faces enormous competitive pressure from giant chains like CompUSA Inc., Office Depot Inc. and even Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ,as well as catalogue dealers and other retail channels. Egghead itself has begun selling and even delivering software over the Internet, although Orban acknowledged the business is ""in its infancy."" CompUSA officials declined to comment on the Egghead news, but Chief Executive Jim Halpin said this week that the chain hopes to increase its market share by targeting as much as $2 billion in sales abandoned by the previously announced industry closures. With $70 million in cash on its balance sheet, Egghead should be able to capture some of those sales as it opens 15 of its new, larger stores over the next year, McAdams said. In an interview, Egghead Chief Financial Officer Brian Bender blamed the company's problems in part on an operation that was too dispersed. The store shutdowns over the next two months will reduce Egghead operations to 24 markets from 54. Among the markets the company is exiting are Atlanta, Las Vegas, Miami, Philadelphia and San Diego. Egghead is closing 12 stores in the Los Angeles area and eight in Chicago. Bender said more than 300 of the company's 1,800 employees would lose their jobs, including all employees at the Lancaster, Pa., distribution facility, which is being shuttered. The company also will sell its Spokane headquarters facility, which it moved into less than two years ago. For the third quarter ended Dec. 28, Egghead reported net income of $1.5 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a loss of $941,000, or 5 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales fell to $113.2 million from $121.7 million. Egghead said sales from the 79 stores targeted to remain open accounted for 64 percent of its revenue in the first nine months of the fiscal year.

"U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it would cut 1,300 jobs at its Halewood plant near Liverpool, northwest England, or almost one third of the workforce, through a redundancy programme. Ford's British operations said that the Halewood plant would not build the planned new model of the Escort car, due in 1999. Production of the new model is likely to transfer to continental European factories in Spain and Germany. However, Ford held out the possibility of Halewood becoming the European source of a planned new vehicle, which is still only a concept at this stage. It added that Halewood would continue to make the current Escort model through 2000. ""The actions we have announced today at Halewood assembly operations give the plant a realistic future, with an exciting new vehicle in the medium term, subject to approval and performance objectives being achieved,"" said David Gorman, European vehicle operations manager for Ford. ""We have had to take these steps to ensure our manned capacity is in line with our forecasts for sales,"" he said. Local Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament David Alton told Reuters he had spoken to Ford, which said the jobs would be lost through voluntary redundancy. He said Halewood was in the running to be the European manufacturing site for a new vehicle, possibly in the family saloon range. ""There's some good news in what they say as well -- that they're looking at Halewood as the probable European site for a planned new vehicle,"" Alton said. The proposed job cuts will reduce Halewood's workforce to just over 3,000, compared with a peak of 14,000 in the 1960s. Management met trade union representatives on Thursday morning to discuss the cuts. Workers expressed anger as they entered the factory, blaming ""flexible"" British labour laws and its opt-out from the European Union's Social Chapter, which sets out minimum working conditions in other EU countries. ""I can give you one reason why the job cuts are here. The Social Chapter,"" said production line group leader Phil Gornall. ""In Germany, if Ford closes its plant there, it has to pay its people 18 months pay in compensation. In the U.K., we've got no Social Chapter, it's easier to shut us down,"" he said. Larry Brook of the MSF union added: ""Britain is the cheapest place to dump labour. We are fighting for the future of Halewood."" Even if a new family saloon is built at Halewood from the late 1990s, the plant would still have excess capacity, car industry experts said. Production of the new Escort is now likely to be undertaken in Ford's plants in Valencia, Spain, and Saarlouis, Germany. Professor Garyl Rhys, a car industry expert at Cardiff University, said Halewood, now a model of industrial relations, was paying for the  ""bad old days"" of the 1960s and 1970s, when the British car industry had a bad strike record. ""Because of the problems at Halewood and a number of other car plants in Britain, there was a reluctance to use them as sources for exports...You couldn't guarantee deliveries because of interruptions to production because of strikes,"" he said. As a result, Halewood produced mostly for the home market. The Liverpool area has a higher than average jobless rate and one in three people is unemployed on some of the housing estates near the plant. Union leaders pledged to fight the cuts.

"Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc will soon own Chef Boyardee, Polaner fruit spreads and PAM cooking spray, but the leveraged buy-out firm still has a big appetite for food companies. The Dallas-based group, which announced on Friday a $1.3 billion acquisition of American Home Products Corp's food unit, plans to buy two Mexican food firms this year and does not intend to stop there, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hicks told Reuters in a telephone interview.   ""Our plan is to use this as a platform,"" he said of the American Home Products deal, the biggest ever for Hicks Muse. ""We intend to start with this and grow both internally and through additional acquisitions of branded products."" Seven-year-old Hicks Muse has been digesting food businesses for several years. It bought dairy firm Morningstar Group in 1991 and took the company public in 1992. In March it bought Ghirardelli Chocolate Co from Boston buy-out specialist Thomas Lee. It also owns Campfire marshmallows and Angela Marie's.   ""We like established brands because we think they offer the most ability of cash flow and long-term growth potential,"" Hicks said. He said his firm had been searching for a large food acquisition and was alerted to the American Home Products food business about six months ago. Most Wall Street analysts had expected the unit to be bought by another food company. The devotion to the food industry by Hicks Muse comes as U.S. food companies undergo major cost-cutting and restructuring programs due to the maturation of key products and intense competition for supermarket shelf space.   On Thursday Campbell Soup Co unveiled a plan to repurchase stock, cut jobs and expand overseas in an effort to boost profits in the mature industry. And Nabisco Holdings Corp announced in June that it would cut 4,200 jobs as part of a cost-cutting program. Hicks said the buy-out firm will finalize plans to integrate American Home Products's food business by the time the deal closes in 60 to 90 days. ""We have a vision of what we are going to do,"" Hicks said, but declined to be specific.   One of Hicks's savviest investments was in the 1980s when he and fellow Dallas investor Robert Haas built a beverage powerhouse through acquisitions of soda brands A&amp;W, Seven-Up, Dr. Pepper and Squirt. But the Hicks Muse group ran into trouble with its 1994 $390 million purchase of G. Heileman Brewing Co, maker of Lone Star beer and other brands. In July it sold the brewer to Stroh Brewery Co for an estimated $275-$300 million. Other Hicks Muse investments include radio stations and a foam company. ","RobinSidel"
"Government officials flew to northern Colombia on Friday in a bid to persuade prisoners to lay down their weapons and release hostages seized in a bloody jail riot, which left four guards confirmed dead. A crack anti-kidnap force, meanwhile, took up positions around the jail and a local police chief raised the possibility of launching a lightning operation to rescue the hostages. A group of 10 hardened convicts heading the revolt refused to budge on earlier demands for two helicopters to airlift them out of the jail in Valledupar, in Cesar province, and take them to an undisclosed location, the city mayor said. At least one of the men, a former leader of the now-defunct M-19 leftist rebel movement, called for political asylum in Cuba. ""I would urge the prisoners to be patient and avoid any further bloodshed. We are on our way to the jail (from Bogota) and want to look for a peaceful solution to this grave problem,"" said government human rights ombudsman Jose Fernando Castro, who is heading the mediation team. About 550 inmates went on a rampage on Thursday evening and seized control of the jail after overpowering 18 guards and confiscating their pistols and nightsticks. Police said leftist guerrillas and four former policemen jailed for kidnapping and extortion are heading the disturbance. A spokeswoman for the National Prisons Institute originally said five guards were reported killed in the shoot-out and a handful of convicts had been injured. By Friday morning, Valledupar mayor Tito Pumarejo confirmed that four bodies, all prison guards, had been ferried out of the jail compound by Red Cross workers. The INPEC spokeswoman said the final death toll may be higher, adding that security forces were still unable to enter the jail. A Valledupar police commander, Col. Alvaro Becerra, said about 100 police and troops had formed three security cordons around the jail and said there was a ""tense but calm stand-off."" ""It would be difficult to mount an operation to rescue the hostages. It would require a great deal of planning. But an elite GAULA (anti-kidnap) squad is in place and a combined police and army strike is a possibility,"" he told Reuters by phone. ""But the inmates' demands are absolutely absurd and I don't think they will be granted,"" he added. The inmates are holding at least 15 hostages, including a 14-year-old girl who was visiting the jail when the riot erupted, and the prison's deputy director. The majority of the prisoners restricted their demands to an end to overcrowding and better conditions. The riot in Valledupar jail, built for 200 inmates and not the current 550 it houses, is the latest in a series of disturbances in Colombian jails. Three provincial prisons were rocked by riots earlier this year. In the last 10 days, 2,000 inmates, led by convicted guerrillas, smashed part of Bogota's La Modelo jail while an inmate died in Bogota's top-security La Picota facility when a bomb he was making in his cell accidentally exploded. Chronic overcrowding is broadly considered to be the main cause of the riots. More than 40,000 prisoners are crammed into facilities designed for 30,000 people, the INPEC spokeswoman said.

"Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin goes to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to further explain the Clinton administration's bank reform plan, but lawmakers are likely to focus foremost on what the plan left out. The Clinton proposal, along with several pending bills, would scrap the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act's separation of banking from other financial services. On the contentious issue of going further and allowing banks to combine with commercial firms, however, the administration ducked.   Instead, the Clinton plan unveiled by Rubin on May 21, offered two alternatives and left the hard choice to Congress. ""We think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress,"" the secretary said as he announced the plan. Congress has debated overhauling antiquated U.S. banking laws for more than a decade without success and some analysts suggest the banking and commerce issue will sidetrack this year's attempts. At Tuesday's House Banking Committee hearing, opponents of mixing banking and commerce led by committee chairman and Iowa Republican Jim Leach will try to steer Rubin to examine the risks of unlimited mergers. Proponents, including subcommittee chairpersons Marge Roukema and Richard Baker, Republicans from New Jersey and Louisiana respectively, will take the opposite tack. Under one of the two alternative outlined by Rubin last month, limited mixing would be permitted but excluding the 1,000 or so largest nonfinancial firms, measured by asset size.   Bank holding companies could derive ""some significant percentage"" of their gross revenues from commercial activity under the approach, referred to as a basket limitation. Under the second alternative, the current prohibition on mixing would be maintained but the current exception allowing commercial firms to own savings and loan institutions would also be maintained. The administration chose to walk a fine line on the issue after Democratic legislators and traditionally Democratic labor and consumer groups came out against combining banking and commerce. On Monday, other opponents including small bankers and agriculture groups issued a statement against even limited mixing of banking and commerce. ""Say NO to those who would undermine the world's strongest and most dynamic economic and financial system,"" the groups said. The 31 signers of the statement ranged from the National Bankers Association to the National Bakers Association. Some lawmakers also plan to raise concerns at the hearing that portions of the Clinton plan contain loopholes that would render any limitations on banking and commerce irrelevent, staffers said.   Any firm could own a thrift and establish a so-called wholesale financial institution. Wholesale banks could only accepts deposits over $100,000, would not be covered by deposit insurance, but would have access to the Federal Reserve's electronic payment system. ""The way the wholesale institution is structured would allow enormous activity,"" one staffer said. ""It's a big loophole."" The notion of allowing savings and loans to continue operating under different rules than banks is also likely to draw some criticism. Under legislation passed by Congress last year to recapitalize the savings industry's deposit insurance fund, the Clinton administration was directed to report on how the legal charters of the two industries could be merged.

"French conglomerate Generale des Eaux looks set to extend its power in the media after revealing on Monday it was in talks with Havas primarily about pay-television firm Canal Plus. ""Havas and Compagnie Generale des Eaux confirm discussions are now in progress concerning their respective interests in audiovisual activities, primarily Canal Plus,"" said a joint statement from Generale des Eaux and Havas. The announcement, rushed out before the stock exchange opened, followed press reports that the companies were preparing a deal which would make Generale des Eaux the key shareholder in Havas. That, in turn, would make the Havas media group the biggest shareholder in Canal Plus. The companies added that they would not comment further pending board meetings scheduled for February 6. The prospect of a major transformation of the French media landscape gained weight when a corporate source confirmed that Alcatel Alsthom was in talks about a possible sale of part of its 21.2 percent stake in Havas to Generale des Eaux. Generale des Eaux, already a powerful force in the water and telecommmunications industry, owns almost 20 percent of Canal Plus. The satellite broadcaster is itself merging with fellow-pay-TV group Nethold to create Europe's largest subscription television company. ""The big winner is (Generale des Eaux chairman) Jean-marie Messier who will find himself at the top of a pyramid in the French audiovisual sector,"" said an analyst at Paribas. According to French newspapers, Generale des Eaux would transfer its Canal Plus stake to Havas, almost doubling Havas's current 21.6 percent stake in the broadcaster. Havas would then increase its own capital to allow Generale des Eaux a bigger stake. Other major shareholders in Canal Plus are the bank Societe Generale with 4.5 percent, and the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations with 6.9 percent. Generale des Eaux would also become indirectly the biggest shareholder in the merged Canal Plus company. Havas would establish its direct dominance within Canal Plus, well ahead of Nethold's owners, Richemont and MIH, which have 15 and 4.9 percent repectively. Alcatel has owned 21.2 percent of Havas since selling its media business to Havas in 1995 in return for shares in Havas, which it was obliged to hold on to for at least two years. The initial market reaction was broadly positive. Havas shares soared and those of Generale jumped too. ""It's a good deal for all parties involved,"" one share dealer said. Alcatel stands to make a capital gain on the sale, as well as receiving cash, because the Havas share price has risen strongly over the past year in line with a French stock market which is at record highs. Alcatel needs money to finance its planned acquisition, if the state permits it, of the government's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF. The government is due to announce its Thomson-CSF sale plans shortly, after scrapping its original privatisation plan in December. Newspapers have for months speculated about the Havas share structure, although Generale des Eaux has in the past denied plans to raise its stake. On the share market, Havas shares opened eight percent higher but then gave up some of the gains to close 4.56 percent up at 424 francs. Generale des Eaux was 1.55 percent up at 719, but Canal Plus was 0.42 percent lower at 1,177 and Alcatel slipped 1.09 percent to 542 francs. -- Paris Newsroom +331 4221 5454 ","MarcelMichelson"
"British Airways World Cargo plans to increase its wet lease freighter service between Hong Kong and London to a daily frequency when the territory's new airport opens next year, the airline's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan, has told Reuters.

"General Motors Corp. stock rose Friday on widening optimism that the auto giant's board of directors on Monday will reward shareholders with a dividend increase and stock buyback programme of up to $5 billion, analysts said. GM shares were up $1.125 to $63 in composite trading after hitting a 52-week high of $63.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading. Analysts said GM, flying high a week after it announced the sale of its Hughes Aircraft defence operations to Raytheon Corp. in a deal worth $9.5 billion, was working to catch up with rivals Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in returning cash to shareholders. ""I think GM is looking at this rightly. It's time to pay the shareholders for their patience,"" said CS First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas. ""They want to hand some cash back to shareholders who have been long waiting on the suffering side."" GM spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said GM was scheduled to consider its dividend at the board meeting, but would not comment on a possible increase or stock buyback programme. The automaker could have afforded such a move last fall, but analysts said it did not want a big payoff to shareholders throwing a wrench into tense contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union. Analysts estimated that the board, which holds its regularly scheduled board meeting for February on Monday, will increase the quarterly dividend by 10 cents to 20 cents a share and announce $2 billion to $3 billion in stock repurchases this year. GM now pays a quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share. Colas said his estimate that GM will buyback $3 billion worth of stock this year was based on expectations that GM ended 1996 with $15 billion in cash, $3 billion above its target of $12 billion. He noted that Chrysler, less than a third of GM's size, plans to repurchase $2 billion worth of shares in 1997. Chrysler's buyback programme has put a floor under the automaker's stock, allowing it to outperform its rivals. Smith Barney analyst David Garrity said the board could authorise as much as $5 billion in repurchases over a longer period of time. GM's dividend hike will be aimed at improving the automakers dividend yield to competitive levels, analysts said. It now is at 2.59 percent, compared with 4.56 percent for Ford and 4.57 percent for Chrysler. A regular share repurchase programme also would lend stability to GM's share price and help it sustain its recent gains, analysts say. In the past month alone, GM shares have risen about 15 percent, from about $55 a share, largely on anticipation of the Hughes deal, news that it settled its industrial espionage dispute with Volkswagen AG and expectations of strong cash flow. ""They've packed an awful lot of good news into a short period of time,"" Bear Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Nicholas Lobaccaro said. ""They've accomplished the goal of getting the stock price up, and now the challenge is to sustain it. That can only get done through consistent earnings for several quarters."" The euphoria over the Hughes deal has overshadowed GM's fourth quarter earnings, which are expected to show the ravages of lower production due to strikes and model launches. GM has said U.S. and Canadian strikes in October and November reduced its fourth quarter results by $700 million. The automaker also is taking a $170 million charge for lump-sum payments associated with its new United Auto Workers contract. According to consensus Wall Street estimates, GM on Tuesday is expected to post fourth quarter earnings of about $385 million, or 51 cents a share, which excludes the $170 million charge. In the fourth quarter of 1995, GM earned a record $1.9 billion, or $1.98 a share, a figure helped by about $577 million worth of tax benefits. ","DavidLawder"
"Mosinee Paper Corp on Wednesday it expected capital expenses to double in 1997 as the paper products company expands capacity during the year. ""We expect to spend about $40 million,"" Daniel Olvey, chief executive of the Mosinee, Wisconsin-based manufacturer, said in an interview. In recent years, the company has spent about half that. The increase would come with Mosinee adding a large number of paper-converting lines at its Bay West commericial towel and tissue unit, Olvey said.   The increased spending is possible because the company paid down $31 million in debt in 1996, freeing up capital this year, Chief Financial Officer Gary Peterson said. About 55 percent of Mosinee's $314.5 million in revenues came from specialty paper in 1996 and the rest from the towel and tissue business. Olvey said he expected towel and tissue to account for more than 50 percent of its revenues in the next couple of years. The company is adding about 30 percent capacity to its Bay West towel paper converting plant and thinks the market can absorb the extra output.   ""We think over a period of two or three years it will be able to absorb that, "" he said. Currently, operating margins in the towel and tissue business are in the high 20 percent range, while the specialty paper margins are in the low to mid 20 percent range, he said. The company produces about 99,000 tons of towel and tissue each year from 140,000 tons of waste paper. Waste paper prices have been moderate in recent weeks, not much changed from the fourth quarter of 1996, Olvey said. The company is seeing some softness in towel and tissue prices. Such seasonal fluctuations are expected, he said.   ""In terms of selling prices, we're seeing stable to slightly up prices on the specialty paper side, and on the towel and tissue side, we're seeing stable to moderately down prices there,"" Olvey said. He expects towel and tissue prices should rebound in the next two months. Raw material costs for the company have been favorable this year, he added. ""The raw materials area is still very soft,"" he said. ""The pulp we're purchasing, there's a lot of deals out there.""   Mosinee focuses on niche businesses, with long-term contracts and above-average margins, to help lessen the effects of cyclicality in the paper business. Olvey said the company was the largest U.S. producer of paper for masking tape, and provides the paper used for the test strip on one brand of battery Olvey would not name. The company also makes decorative laminate for countertops and is one of the manufacturers of paper boxes for McDonald's Corp sandwiches. Aside from adding capacity through capital improvement, Mosinee continues to look at potential acquisitions. ""We are very interested in making good acquisitions that we are comfortable with for the long haul,"" Olvey said. ""We want equipment that is not only competitive in the marketplace now, but is competitive 15 to 20 years from now."" Acquisitions should also fit a niche with which the company is familiar. ""We are interested in expanding our specialty papers business, because we are at capacity there,"" he said. ((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787)) ","BradDorfman"
"France Telecom has been ordered by France's new telecommunications supervisor to review a proposal for a list of prices it will charge its future competitors for the use of parts of its infrastructure. ""We have had a meeting will all the operators yesterday. We are waiting for a new proposal by France Telecom,"" Jean-Michel Hubert, president of the new ART regulator, said during the body's first news conference on Thursday. The catalogue of so-called interconnection charges is going to be a key element both for the economic viability of future entrants into the French market as well as for the value of France Telecom, slated for partial privatisation this spring in the biggest French market float ever. Hubert said that he hoped to be able to render opinion of the Autorite de Regulation des Telecommunications (ART) on the draft decree on interconnection at the start of February. Telecommunications Minister Francois Fillon aims to publish the final decree before the end of that month. As far as the actual price list is concerned he hoped the five-strong body could take a decision ""as soon as possible"" and added it should be before the partial sale of France Telecom. He declined to be specific about what kind of changes ART was asking from France Telecom -- the other operators are demanding drastic price cuts from an original proposal -- only saying that he wanted to be ""equitable"". Hubert noted that there was ""only a small window"" between a price structure at which competition was impossible and another at which competition would be ""ridiculous"". He added that while ART would take account of international comparisons, because he believed there would be a move to harmonise these costs internationally, he said such a comparison should not be the norm for a decision. ART started its legal life on January 6, taking over the regulatory and licencing authorities that were previously the prerogative of the Ministry of Telecommunications. ART is indepedent and will also have to act as an arbitrator in case of disputes between various operators. Its five members -- appointed by the presidents of the republic, senate and parliament -- cannot be sacked nor can they seek a new term. Apart from Hubert, the members are Dominique Roux, Yvon Le Bars, Roger Chinaud and Bernard Zuber. Hubert said that a difference with Britain's OFTEL was that ART will take decisions as a college while at OFTEL the director-general has the decision-making power. Asked whether ART would make life as difficult for France Telecom as OFTEL has made that of British Telecom Plc, Hubert said only that he expected ""hard and difficult talks with all operators."" Hubert said he wanted to promote growth of the market, which would boost economic growth and jobs. He said he had the interests of the consumer in mind and noted the existence of ART alone as an unbiased regulator was an incentive to competition. But he made it clear that ART would also come to the aid of France Telecom, or other French operators, as far as international matters were concerned. ART still needs to appoint a director of international affairs but Hubert said the matter was very important and had to be based on reciprocity -- if French operators find obstacles abroad, ART could be engaged in the negotiations. Hubert is travelling to London on Monday to meet OFTEL's Don Cruickshank and other international counterparts. He said much of the international negotiations would need to be done on a European level while the EU member states would want to harmonise their regulation in a single telecoms market. Hubert said that ART was following closely discussions between France Telecom, Generale des Eaux unit SFR and Bougues Telecom about the cost of interconnecting mobile telecommunications but said ART had not been asked to arbitrate in the matter. ""I hope the operators come to an agreement,"" he said. ","MarcelMichelson"
"Britain's largest brewer Scottish and Newcastle is prepared to stick with its Center Parcs holiday resorts through both good times and bad, chief executive Brian Stewart said. ""We do see leisure as offering very significant growth oppurtunities, we have to take the rough with the smooth and we have a period which is difficult but we will overcome that,"" he told Reuters late on Tuesday. Profits from Center Parcs resorts were down 11 percent at 39 million pounds at the half-year stage due to weak economic conditions in mainland Europe and the cost of improving its facilities in the Netherlands. The relatively poor performance of S&amp;N's leisure division has caused many analysts to question the wisdom of S&amp;N's move into leisure. ""We certainly hope the consumer gains a little bit of confidence in Europe but we are very positive about initiatives we are taking now to get Center Parcs back on track."" Bookings in UK Center Parcs were ""very strong and well ahead of last year,"" said Stewart. He said the planned opening of Rank -owned village holiday resort Oasis was no more serious a competitive a threat than any other leisure deveopment. He said the company planned to concentrate on existing Center Parcs and no new Center Parcs would be built in the next year. ""We are very positive about our future prospects from our leisure division, where we see significant growth oppurtunities,"" said Stewart, adding that he expected to see some improvement in mainland Europe from Center Parcs in 1998. ""Whether the consumer recovers in terms of confidence, especially in Germany, I think is debatable because there will be political and economic uncertainty there this calendar year."" He said S&amp;N was unconcerned that it had lost some market share to Bass BASS.l in the beer market. ""I'm not worried about the competition, I'm worried that our brands continue to perform as well as they have done over the past twelve months."" ""Our brands are performing better and people are more conscious about brands, consumer service and marketing support, so I see the recipe pretty much as we have experienced over the last 12 months."" Stewart said S&amp;N expected to continue to supply beer to most of Inntrepeneur's 3,000 tied pubs, despite the fact its exclusive beer supply contract with the company expires in March 1998. Pub company Inntrepreneur is jointly owned by Grand Metropolitan and Australian brewer Foster's. ""We do anticipate we will hold the majority of the brands based on our brand performance through those outlets. You have got to remember that publicans have traded with these brands for many years and they will not wish to upset their customers, particularly when the brands are performing as well as they are."" - London Newroom +44 171 542 6437 ","TimFarrand"
"JAMtv, a six-month-old online company started by a Chicago music promoter, hopes to turn the personal computer into a personalized jukebox. As a first step, the company will unveil on Monday a music network on the Internet using multimedia technology from Intel Corp. JAMtv plans to broadcast live concerts, link with radio stations for other programming, sell CDs and other merchandise and provide daily news and reviews. The company is also working with privately held BackWeb, one of the leading ""push"" technology companies, which broadcasts personalized news and information directly to a person's PC. ""The goal is that you will have your own personal jukebox on your computer,"" Howard Tullman, chief executive of JAMtv, said. JAMtv spun out from Jam Productions Ltd, a well-known concert producer and promoter in Chicago whose co-founder, Jerry Mickelsen, is chairman. The company hopes its network will become the main source of music on the Internet, featuring contemporary and alternative rock arists and eventually country and jazz. But JAMtv is not trying to be the MTV of the Internet, Tullman stressed. He noted that in recent years MTV has had to change its programming to offer more shows and features, like the ""Real World"" soap opera, because MTV viewers tired of someone else making their programming decisions for them. ""It's a network of one,"" Tullman said of the planned JAMtv service. ""Anytime you go there, you can listen to what you want. You don't have to wait for someone to make these programming decisions for you,"" he said. ""We will let you design your profile and what you want."" He said the JAMtv site on the World Wide Web will have daily events, with a calender of more than 1,500 events already planned for this year based on upcoming Jam Productions events, such as a U2 concert in Soldier Field in Chicago as part of the group's tour. Users of the JAMtv site can also buy from a catalog of more than 140,000 music CDs, 70,000 music and entertainment videos and access an archive of images, audio, video and other data on hundreds of artists. Tullman also said JAMtv was talking to computer makers and to Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Commuications Corp. in an effort in get a spot on the Windows desktop and a part of the Netscape browser, so that users will be able to simply click on an icon and have their JAMtv. JAMtv is also embracing Intel's ""hybrid"" method of sending fat audio and video files over the Internet, by providing users with compact disks of some audio and video, which is then supplemented by updated audio and video streams sent over the Internet. The company hopes to make money is several ways, by selling merchandise over the Internet, by selling advertising and licensing fees to radio affiliates for programming and through compiling databases on subscribers which it could sell to record companies. Ultimately, Tullman said, a big JAMtv revenue stream will come from a ""pay-per-view"" distribution of live concerts on the Internet. ""At the end of the day, when you can truly go home at night and click on your PC and watch any concert you want, there will be pay per view revenues in this business,"" Tullman said.

"Regulators want more time to overhaul the vast web of subsidies that keeps phone service affordable, creating a new obstacle in their efforts to spawn new competition and lower prices in the telephone business. Federal Communications Commission and industry officials said Tuesday the FCC is running into difficulties calculating the multi-billion dollar cost of paying for ""universal"" phone service to rural and other high-cost communities. ""We've been working hard for a year to try and reconcile this,"" said FCC Chief Economist Joseph Farrell. ""It would be a mistake to hurry it and do it wrong."" Last year's communications law set a May 8 deadline for the FCC to tally the costs and to lay out a plan for a new fund to bankroll the subsidies. Phone carriers are supposed to pay for the fund. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told the Wall Street Journal he wants to implement key provisions next year and use an interim plan in the meantime. The FCC will work with state regulators to determine the costs of the subsidies. Industry analysts and officials say the new uncertainty is likely to deter phone companies from rushing to compete in new areas of business or upgrade their existing lines of business. ""We need to know what the rules of the game are before we're willing to commit a lot of money to new projects,"" said Robert Blau, BellSouth Corp. vice president. Schwab Washington Research Group analyst Scott Cleland put it this way, ""When the playing field remains clouded, prudent competitors don't rush into the fog."" The phone business already has a huge cloud overhanging it after a U.S. appeals court last fall suspended a key FCC order designed to break open the $100 billion local phone market to long-distance carriers and other new competitors. The FCC is trying to calculate the size of the universal service subsidies and make them explicit, as stipulated by the telecommunications law. Estimates range anywhere from $5 billion to $20 billion. The existing subsidies are buried in the $23 billion in charges that long-distance companies such as AT&amp;T Corp. now pay to access the local phone network. The FCC's desire to take more time on universal service has raised concern and questions among lawmakers anxious to ensure competition takes root after passage of the telecommunications law. ""If one of the implications (of the added time) is that it does delay competition, it's a problem for us,"" said Representative W.J. Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican. ""We're beginning to see some concerns about rising phone rates and cable rates. And we're beginning to be asked at town meetings when we're going to see the benefits of this highly touted deregulatory act."" Meanwhile, the FCC's Hundt does want to proceed with one prized piece of universal service -- a $2.3 billion plan to link schools and libraries to the Internet at discounted rates. But Tauzin worries that Hundt, in his desire to keep basic phone rates from rising, will expand obligations under universal service ""that somebody is going to have to pay for."" ","RogerFillion"
"AT&amp;T Corp. is earning more, but having trouble getting paid. The nation's largest telephone company said Wednesday that operating profits from continuing operations for the last quarter of 1996 rose 14 percent, but said it had to put aside $200 million to cover unpaid bills by customers. The telecommunications company, which has now completed its split into three major units, said it earned $1.24 billion, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $1.09 billion, or 68 cents a share, in 1995's last quarter. Chief financial officer Richard Miller told Wall Street analysts in a conference call that results for the first quarter of 1997 would be comparable or slightly above those of the fourth quarter. Revenues in the latest period rose to $13.24 billion from $12.89 billion. The Basking-Ridge, N.J.-based company's 1995 fourth-quarter operating profits excluded restructuring and other charges totaling $2.036 billion, or $1.27 a share. Including these charges, its net earnings from continuing operations resulted in a loss of $948 million, or 59 cents a share. Competition has brought the company a new headache. ""It used to be if you don't pay your phone bill you didn't get phone service. Now with multiple suppliers, we can shut off their service, but they can go someplace else to get service,"" Miller told Reuters. The problem is worst among business users, particularly the hundreds of tiny long-distance resellers, some of whom go bankrupt after ordering millions of network minutes from carriers like AT&amp;T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. in order to compete with them. AT&amp;T's fourth-quarter operating net per share was three cents below the 79 cents industry analysts had forecast, according to First Call, mainly on the extra $200 million in provisions for bad debts. As a result, some analysts lowered their 1997 estimates. ""No one was expecting that,"" said Bear Stearns analyst Bette Massick. ""You have to cut your number on that alone."" For all of 1996, AT&amp;T's income from continuing operations rose to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion for 1995, excluding the charges. Earnings per share for 1996 were $3.47, a 5.5 percent increase over $3.29 per share in 1995. Total 1996 revenues were $52.2 billion, a 3 percent increase over 1995's $50.7 billion. ""AT&amp;T had a record year in 1996 in the face of extraordinary challenges and unprecedented changes in our business and in our industry,"" said Chairman Robert E. Allen. In September 1995, AT&amp;T said it would restructure its businesses, spinning off equipment company Lucent Technologies in September, and it completed with the spinoff of computer company NCR at the end of 1996. AT&amp;T also sold its majority position in AT&amp;T Capital Corporation to a consortium of investors during the year. AT&amp;T said its communications services revenue increased $529 million in the latest quarter, up 4.3 percent from the same period last year. Communications services revenues include wireline services and wireless services, as well as communications products and other services. It said its long-distance calling volumes grew 6 percent over the same period in 1995 and 1.8 percent over the previous quarter. ""The growth in traffic volumes (3.2 percent) was better than the 2.5 percent we were expecting,"" said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. ""But they are still losing market share to the tune of three percentage points a year,"" he said. AT&amp;T's wireless services revenue, which includes cellular voice and data, messaging and air-to-ground services, grew 18.4 percent to $937 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. Its cellular service subscribers grew to 5.2 million, a 31.7 percent increase from a year ago. Revenues from communications products and other services, which include consulting and outsourcing, on-line, and wireless product sales, were $386 million, an increase of nearly 17 percent from the year-ago quarter. However, credit card revenue plunged 32.3 percent to $374 million, primarily as a result of the securitization program instituted at AT&amp;T Universal Card Services in 1995. Credit card operating losses fell to $4 million in the fourth quarter from $35 million in the third quarter of 1996. In 1995's fourth quarter, it made an operating profit of $109 million. AT&amp;T's stock closed 50 cents down at $38.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. ","NickLouth"
"Riding a crest of popular vehicles, Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, but special charges held the automaker back from its best-ever full-year profit. The U.S. No. 3 automaker earned $807 million, or $1.12 per share, during the fourth quarter after $279 million in charges. Excluding those charges, Chryler's operating earnings were a record $1.09 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Chrysler posted net income of $1.04 billion, or $1.33 a share. Chrysler stock jumped $1.625 to $36.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. ""Our 1996 results were outstanding in virtually every respect thanks to what is arguably the strongest product lineup in the industry and to the dedication of our people who have worked so hard to get us where we are today,"" Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement. Chrysler reported full-year 1996 net income of $3.53 billion, or $4.74 per share. The automaker's 1996 profit fell short of its 1994 record of $3.71 billion because of $347 million in special charges taken during 1996. On a pretax basis, Chrysler earned $6.09 billion for all of 1996, a new calendar-year record that topped 1995's $3.45 billion. The company, which had its most recent brush with bankruptcy in 1991, rewarded its U.S. employees handsomely in 1996 with average profit-sharing checks of $7,900 -- more than double the $3,200 they received in 1995. Based on pretax earnings, Chrysler said the profit sharing was below the $8,000 it paid out for 1994 because more employees will share in the profits. About 79,000 hourly and salaried workers in the United States will receive their payments in February. Two years ago, Chrysler issued profit sharing checks to 75,200 workers in the United States. During the fourth quarter, Chrysler's profit was reduced by $279 million in charges that covered the early retirement of debt; higher United Auto Workers pension costs; a voluntary early retirement program; and the write-down of Pentastar Electronics, a subsidiary sold to a Huntsville, Ala., investor group for $17 million. Excluding the charges, Chrysler earned $1.09 billion, or $1.51 a share, in the quarter and $3.88 billion, or $5.21, for the year, beating two-year-old records for operating results. Wall Street cheered the results, which beat analysts' fourth-quarter consensus operating estimate of $1.43 a share. John Casesa, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim, said the most impressive news was an increase in the quarter's gross profit margin to 22.3 percent from 20.8 percent -- thanks to high-profit vehicles such as the Ram pickup trucks and minivans. ""The highlight was the company's gross margin was very good, and that reflects a continued rich product mix,"" he said. Eaton told reporters in a conference call that Chrysler's financial position was so strong it might not need to dip into its approximately $7 billion cash reserve to fund operations and stay profitable during the next industry downturn. ""That would allow us to use a significant portion of our cash reserves for growth opportunities that might just occur during such a downturn,"" Eaton said. Casesa said it was the first time Eaton has made such a prediction. ""It would be the first time in decades any automaker would have been able to do that,"" Casesa said. He added that growth opportunities could include purchasing vehicle assembly capacity cheaply from a competitor that needed to unload a costly plant during a recession. Chrysler attributed its strong performance to a 10.7 percent increase in worldwide factory vehicle sales, to 2,958,800 from 2,673,539 in 1995. Based on strong sales of trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans, Chrysler's share of the U.S. and Canadian car and truck market climbed to 16.1 percent for the year from 14.7 percent in 1995. Eaton said in a statement the company would not rest on its laurels. ""There is no end to the improvements we can achieve if we remain vigilant about controlling our costs and about continually improving our processes and our products,"" Eaton said. ""That's the challenge we're all focused on and its one I'm confident we'll meet."" ","DavidLawder"
"China has made a gesture to the United States by ordering Boeing jets but it has left the door open to the aircraft maker's European rival in a thinly veiled mix of politics and commerce, analysts said on Tuesday. They said improving Sino-U.S. ties, highlighted by the visit of U.S. Vice President Al Gore, had enabled Boeing Co to sign a pact to sell five 777s to Air China for $685 million. But Beijing was holding back orders for planes it clearly needed, keeping a close eye on the progress of Sino-U.S. ties and squeezing maximum concessions from Washington on a range of trade issues, they said. ""This is a very political game,"" said a foreign diplomat. ""The Chinese are moving ahead cautiously. The decisions are made by (Premier) Li Peng himself."" Diplomats said new deals for Boeing or rival Airbus Industrie could be linked to China's campaign to join the World Trade Organisation. The United States has been the most vocal advocate of wresting further concessions from China in liberalising its domestic market before it is allowed to join the trade body. Beijing may also be hoping to make progress in its bid to persuade Washington to grant it permanent most favoured nation trading status to avoid an annual review. Boeing officials said they had been looking to sell 10 of their twin-engine 777s to Air China, the main Chinese international carrier. They insisted the smaller-than-hoped-for order, delayed by more than one year by Sino-U.S. friction, was a commercial decision and they were confident of making more sales for the same type of plane in future. China often assails the West for mixing trade and diplomacy. But the political drama behind the Boeing deal was highlighted by the signing ceremony in the Great Hall of the People as both Gore and Premier Li looked on. Gore is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then-president George Bush travelled to Beijing in early 1989 -- just months before a crackdown on democracy protests in the Chinese capital's Tiananmen Square. ""Airbus will be disappointed at today's order,"" said a another Western diplomat. ""They were looking to sell the A330-300,"" a twin-engine jet that Airbus says it has not yet sold in China. But Boeing has hardly dealt its key rival a knockout blow. ""This is not a mega-order,"" said an industry analyst. The next sign of how political ties translate into contracts could emerge at the forthcoming visit by French President Jacques Chirac. Analysts said they would watch closely to see whether new plane orders go to Airbus Industrie and how many planes were purchased. China has said it will put in service some 240 more planes during the current five-year plan ending in the year 2000 to keep up with rising demand for domestic and international air travel. Most of those planes have yet to be ordered. Boeing officials, quoting Chinese data, said they were well ahead in the China market so far with some 216 planes in service against 29 for Airbus. But Boeing underwent a dry spell in 1996, notching only a handful of sales in a year in which Sino-U.S. ties were rocked by Beijing's sabre-rattling aimed at Taiwan as well as disputes over trade, arms control and human rights. Airbus signed a pact for 30 of the Airbus A320 narrow body jets in April last year in a deal worth $1.5 billion. Those planes compete with Boeing's smaller 737 jets. Boeing officials said that with some of the political friction out of the way, they expect more market inroads, and note the latest deal brings this year's sales to $1.2 billion. But analysts cautioned that despite the improvement in Sino-U.S. ties, issues between the two states were unlikely to be resolved soon and would add a political tint to future commercial deals.

"International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday introduced its next generation mainframe computer family, with systems twice as fast as currently available models, in a product launch widely anticipated by its customers. ""The feedback is phenomenal,"" said Ross Mauri, vice president of System 390 hardware developnment, in a phone interview. ""We have seen quite a bit of demand out there."" ""Customers have been enthusiastic about embracing the new server,"" Mauri said, adding that it is likely that IBM will be ""sold out of what we can produce this year,"" based on the initial customer reaction. Mainframes are giant computers that store the data of the biggest corporations around the world. They are used by banks for transactions, by airlines for reservations systems, and by insurance companies for claims processing. While many analysts have predicted the demise of these giant computers as more companies move to PC-based networks, mainframes have staged somewhat of a comeback as huge repositories of data that is accessible via the Internet and internal networks known as intranets. The new mainframe servers use the third generation of IBM's lower-cost processor technology, called CMOS. The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology is a process that uses microprocessor technology that is less costly to build and less expensive for customers to maintain. IBM introduced two new lines of System 390 servers, or computers that manage networks. One family, called the IBM S/390 Parallel Entreprise Server, has 13 models designed specifically for heavy data storage and for transaction intensive companies. The second server line, the IBM S/390 Multiprise 2000, is aimed at medium-sized customers who are currently using IBM S/390 mainframes, but wish to increase their computing power. The Multiprise is also aimed at customers who wish to buy an entire package, with software and storage systems. So far, IBM has installed about 14 of the S/390 Parallel Enterprise Servers - Generation 3 in an early customer program. IBM has also installed three of the S/390 Multiprise. IBM also said it introduced an upgrade of its mainframe operating system, called OS/390 Release 2, which provides more connectivity for customers to computer networks such as the Internet and UNIX based systems. IBM also introduced other software products for better network computing over the S/390. IBM also introduced new mainframe disk storage products for improved data reliabilty. IBM declined to give any price details on the new models, saying that it tailors each systems to unique customer needs and that customers are now familiar with the lower prices of CMOS-based mainframes. ""As you make the transition from bipolar to CMOS, you see a significant price reduction,"" said Mauri. ""Customers already have an understanding of that."" Bipolar refers to the process technology that IBM used in its older mainframe models. Three years ago, IBM began preparing its customers for a big transition to a new, lower-cost machine, designed around microprocessors. Analysts said the new mainframes run at speeds of around 45 million instructions per second (MIPS), twice as fast as the currently available speeds of 22 million instructions per second for the fastest CMOS models, bringing the systems up to the speeds of the older bipolar machines, and at a lower cost. Even with the prices of these huge milllion dollar systems falling, mainframes are still IBM's biggest revenue producing hardware. Analysts are hoping for a big uptick in fourth quarter earnings, in part due to mainframes, because the lower-cost models are more profitable to IBM. ""These are all necessary announcements for IBM,"" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial Group analyst, adding that the products are important to IBM's future earnings. IBM said the new models will be available next month. ""The mainframe as we once knew it, where MIPS were expensive, we are never going to see that again,"" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. ""IBM has re-engineered the mainframe, they don't even want to call it a mainframe anymore, they call it a server."" ","TheresePoletti"
"When General Motors Corp.'s former Chairman Roger Smith forked over $5.1 billion for Hughes Aircraft Co., he envisioned an industrial Goliath that would develop space-age technologies for every-day cars. Nearly 12 years the later, the verdict is mixed on Smith's grand plan, analysts said Thursday. Raytheon Corp.'s agreement to purchase the Hughes defence operations is valued at $9.5 billion -- more than covering the original cost of the entire company bought from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in June 1985. If 100 percent of the Hughes-linked GM Class H stock were valued at Thursday's closing stock price of just under $63 a share, Hughes would be worth $25.2 billion. Under the structure before the proposed sale, about 25 percent of the Class H shares were traded publicly, with the rest held by GM. Financially, GM's purchase of Hughes has paid off handsomely for the world's largest automaker. But from the perspective of integrating Hughes and GM products, the experiment has not panned out, some analysts say. One attempt was a heads-up instrument display like those used on fighter jet cockpits that was incorporated into Oldsmobiles and Pontiacs -- but never went anywhere. ""The idea of synergistically combining aerospace technology into the automobile business, and applying GM's advanced mass production technology to the high-cost aerospace business, was an idea straight out of cloud cuckoo-land and it never happened,"" said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc. ""Roger Smith was a terrible manager but a great investor,"" Healy added. Analysts also pointed out that when GM's industry dominance slipped in the mid-1980s, the money it tapped for Hughes was unavilable to sink into sorely needed new car and truck programmes. Indeed, Hughes Chairman C. Michael Armstrong acknowledged Wednesday that GM does not need to own Hughes to get the benefits of its radar and other aerospace technology. But other analysts argued that GM has reaped untold strategic benefits from Hughes that are not readily visible to outside observers. One of the first benefits GM received was a vast improvement in its systems engineering capabilities, said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Centre for the Study of Automotive Transportation. GM's EV1 electric car, the industry's first electric vehicle designed from the ground up, would not have been possible without Hughes' Delco Electronics Corp. unit, which developed the inductive charging system, as well as the lead-acid batteries. Another Hughes product appearing on GM vehicles is the OnStar navigation and security system. GM plans to offer the $895 optional system on vehicles outside its Cadillac division by the 1998 model year. Cole said there were numerous other applications for Hughes' technology, including future electric vehicle platforms and other vehicles that incorporate hybrid technologies. ""Financially, it was excellent,"" said Cole. ""The problem is that a lot of people outside don't see the level of integration."" ","ToddNissen"
"Tears flowed and eight bells tolled at a farewell for the Royal Navy in Hong Kong on Friday as Britain shut its HMS Tamar naval base in an end-of-empire retreat leading up to the colony's July 1 return to China. Except during the Japanese occupation between 1941 and 1945, eight bells have rung three times a day for more than 100 years at HMS Tamar, marking the Royal Navy's watch over one of Britain's most prized colonial possessions. First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jock Slater, Governor Chris Patten and other dignitaries spoke of dignity and pride as the White Ensign was lowered, furled and folded at the base on Stonecutters Island in Hong Kong harbour. ""The White Ensign has just been lowered over this shore base but the values that it has stood for will, I hope, remain in this place: respect for law and for person, trust, duty and service,"" Patten told more than 200 sailors. ""But there is no cause for thinking sad thoughts, that there is dishonour in these endings. Nothing has melted away. There have been no defeats,"" Patten said. ""What the Navy has done is help to provide the stability that enabled commerce and industry to flourish and let Hong Kong develop into what it is today,"" said Commander Oliver Wright, who served 40 years with the Royal Navy from 1941 to 1981. In a ceremony that drew tears from oldtimers saddened by the decommissioning of Britain's last naval base east of Suez, more than 200 seamen in stiff, white uniforms marched through the gates to an upbeat rhythm set by the Royal Marines' brass band. HMS Tamar shut 100 years to the day that a vessel of the same name first arrived in Hong Kong waters. Its closure ended a 156-year association between the Royal Navy and Hong Kong. The first naval officer to set foot in Hong Kong was probably Sir Edward Belcher, who landed on 25 January 1841 and drank to Queen Victoria's health on Possession Mount on Hong Kong Island. The Union flag was raised the following day. Many younger naval officers were pragmatic about the end of such a long relationship, ""Hong Kong's time is up,"" said radio operator Steve McSevich. ""It's reverting to Chinese rule and there's no shame in that. The Chinese will leave it pretty much as it is."" China, whose navy will occupy another site on Stonecutters Island, was not represented at the ceremony, another sign of the stalemate in Sino-British negotiations as the transition nears. The only Chinese present were locally hired personnel, many of whom now have until June 30 to find new jobs. The future of the HMS Tamar site is uncertain, but the three Peacock class patrol craft based there have been bought by the Philippines, which will take possession soon after July 1. ","SarahDavison"
"Vita Food Products Inc, which sells kosher seafood and other specialty products, is scouting for acqusitions that could help it boost annual sales four-fold within the next five years. ""With the right mix of acquisitions, I think we could do $75 million to $100 million (in sales) annually. We've (also) got some things that could really take off internally,"" Stephen Rubin, president, said in an interview. ""I'd like to see it (the sales target reached) before five years."" Vita's sales amounted to $21.4 million in 1995.   The company, with products such as salmon and herring sold under the Vita brand, expects to complete at least one acquisition by the end of the year, Rubin said. Acquisition targets include companies that sell kosher food or products that could later be certified as kosher. One of the targets is related to seafood, he added. Rubin added that Vita could also acquire a regional, non-kosher food company and take it national under the existing brand name through Vita's distribution network. Over 95 percent of Vita's sales, however, are kosher products.   Jay Dembsky, Vita's chief financial officer, estimated that the kosher food market overall is growing by 10 to 11 percent annually, whereas the overall food industry grows only in line with the population. Kosher food, he added, appeals to consumers beyond those adhering to Jewish dietary laws. Kosher food carries ""a perception of higher quality,"" Dembsky said. Vita also hopes to reap higher sales in 1997 from two new products that were rolled out in the fourth quarter of 1996 -- a line of hummus, a Middle Eastern dish made from chick peas, and frozen salmon burgers. ""We expect to see meaningful impact in 1997 from these products,"" Dembsky said. Vita, which went public earlier this year at $6.00 a share, said it would make secondary offerings in the future if it needed to raise capital for acquisition programs, Rubin said.

"Sony Corp. on Monday cut the U.S. price of its PlayStation video game machine by 25 percent to $149, a move that is expected to boost the entire video game industry. Sony also cut the price of all of its new software titles for the PlayStation to $49, making games for the machine cheaper than many of its rivals' offerings. The price cuts make the PlayStation $50 cheaper than the Nintendo 64, Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s rival video game machine. Sony's move could force Nintendo to cut its prices, which would accelerate hardware and accelerate software purchases, analysts said. ""Hardware price cuts are good news for everybody,"" said Mike Wallace, analyst at UBS Securities in New York. ""The most important thing to the industry is a bigger installed base"" of video game machines. Sony's price cut could be the start of a boom for the video game industry, similar to the one in the late 1980s. For the past three years, game companies have had lukewarm sales because of high prices for the new generation of video game machines, based on so-called 32-bit or 64-bit technologies. While the next-generation offerings from Sony, Nintendo and Sega Enterprises have much better graphics and sound than their predecessors, they have been too expensive for most households, analysts said. With the price cut, the number of PlayStation units in use in the United States could almost double to 6 million by Christmas, from about 3.4 million right now, Wallace said. Sony officials said even with the price cuts they make money on each PlayStation. They also said they do not expect their software price cuts to hurt outside software publishers, since Sony's software prices are slightly higher than the rest of the industry's. Software executives applauded Sony's move. ""This is obviously great for the software publishers,"" said Bobby Kotick, chairman of video game software company Activision Inc.. Kotick said with hardware prices getting closer to $100, he expects 18 million to 20 million machines to be sold by year-end. Nintendo officials said they are analysing Sony's move.

"Building materials and energy group Boral Ltd reported a lower net profit for the first half year on Wednesday, but said it was poised to take advantage of a long awaited upturn in the house building sector. ""The building materials division is now in a position to exploit the upturn,"" Boral managing director Tony Berg told reporters after announcing the profit fall. ""The upturn will bring profit leverage from improved margins and price improvements and further leverage will come from lowering costs,"" Berg said.   Earlier, Boral reported a A$93.16 million net profit for the six months to December 31, down from A$169.71 million in the same period a year earlier. This was due in large part to a A$49.5 million abnormal profit booked from an asset sale in the previous comparable period. Net profit pre-abnormals fell to A$96 million from A$120 million the previous year and compared with market expectations for a pre-abnormals net of about A$90 million. Analysts said the result was a touch above expectations, largely because of a much stronger result from Boral's U.S. building materials operations. ","BernardHickey"
"Toronto stocks extended their winning streak to end higher on Thursday, powered by surging banks as fears of a Canadian interest rate hike eased. The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 33.27 points to 6009.90. Trading was heavy at 95.3 million shares worth C$1.7 billion ($1.2 billion). In the past three sessions, Canada's largest market jumped by more than 2.5 percent. Banks led 12 of Toronto's 14 sub-indices to higher ground, rising almost 1.8 percent as investors put aside worries that Canada would raise interest rates to match U.S. hikes. Investment advisor Ira Katzin with RBC Dominion Securities said: ""Financial services benefited from the expectations that interest rates would stay stable or ease off a bit."" But market watchers were eying Friday's U.S. employment data, Katzin said. The numbers could provide more indication of whether U.S. inflation was on the rise, which could prompt rate hikes by U.S. and Canadian central banks. The U.S. government will report April's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate. Toronto's stronger sub-sectors included media, pipelines and real estate, while conglomerates and forestry products fell. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 500 to 447 and 301 were flat. In active issues, gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. lost 0.44 to 3.04 in heavy dealings. Investors continued to consider the worth of its controversial Busang project in Indonesia. Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's largest bank, rose 1.35 to 57.20 and third-ranked Bank of Montreal also rose 1.35 to 52.05. ","LydiaZajc"
"Humana Inc. reported lower quarterly profits Tuesday, mainly due to charges for restructuring, but the stock in the big health maintenance organization rose on optimism over its new president's ambitious turnaround plan. The 4.9-million member HMO -- fifth largest in the United States among for-profit HMOs -- posted fourth-quarter net income of $22 million, or 13 cents a share, after charges, down from $49 million, or 30 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Quarterly premium revenues were $1.81 billion, up from $1.49 billion in the year-ago period. For the full year, Humana said net income plunged 94 percent to $12 million, or 7 cents a share, from $190 million, or $1.17 a share. The company reported revenues of $6.7 billion, up from $4.6 billion in 1995. The stock of the Louisville, Ky.-based Humana rose 37.5 cents to $18.75 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $19.25. ""What the stock is responding to is Humana's outlining a pretty aggressive action plan. ... They're making the organization more lean and mean,"" said Gary Frazier, a health care industry analyst with the Bear Sterns brokerage. When Gregory Wolf became president of Humana in September, he took over a company that once had led the managed health care industry, but had more recently seen its star fade as it expanded into unprofitable areas. Wolf had previously been president of Emphesys Financial Group Inc., which Humana acquired in October 1995. With the help of a new executive staff, Wolf is pushing through a tough plan to cut costs and withdraw Humana from money-losing markets. ""He's made some very intelligent moves,"" said Ed Keaney, health-care industry analyst with the Volpe Welty brokerage. In the fourth quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $10 million after taxes related mainly to severance costs for elimination of 700 to 900 jobs this year from its roughly 18,000-member work force. The company has sold or is selling money-losing operations in Alabama, Washington, D.C., and other markets. In the second quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $130 million after taxes to restructure the Washington health plan, provide for expected insurance losses, close 13 service areas and discontinue unprofitable products in three markets. As a result, the company said total enrollment in its commercial health care plans fell by 69,100 members last year, by 87,500 members in January alone and is expected to decline by 115,000 members this quarter. ""Our plans to withdraw from certain markets and price business commensurate with the underlying risk are proceeding on schedule,"" Wolf said. The company's medical-loss ratio -- a key measure of profitability -- improved to 82.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 83.1 percent in the third quarter, but was up from 81.5 percent in the year-ago period. Analysts said they were impressed with Wolf's plan for reversing Humana's fortunes but noted the company unveiled a turnaround plan once before that was never fully achieved. ""I want to see a little more of a turn in earnings before I'm sure this action plan is taking hold,"" Frazier said. ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"First Bank System Inc. said Thursday it will acquire U.S. Bancorp  in a stock deal worth more than $8.5 billion that will make it the 14th-largest bank in the United States and give it a firm toehold in the Pacific Northwest. The deal between Minneapolis-based First Bank and U.S. Bancorp, a regional bank based in Portland, Ore., will also result in the loss of about 4,000 jobs, the banks said. Under a definitive agreement, U.S. Bancorp shareholders will receive in a tax-free exchange 0.755 share of First Bank common stock for each U.S. Bancorp share they own. Based on First Bank's trading price of $75.375 Thursday, which was down $2.875, the purchase price equals $56.91 a share for holders of U.S. Bancorp, whose shares jumped $6.75 to $55. ""This is very rich pricing,"" said James Schutz at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp., noting the deal values U.S. Bancorp at about 19.2 times its 1996 earnings. However, First Bank Chief Executive John Grundhofer's reputation for aggressive cost-cutting, the complementary fit of U.S. Bancorp with First Bank's mostly Midwestern markets and the rich price of bank stocks in general made the deal palatable to many analysts. ""You could live a couple of lifetimes without finding another fit this good,"" Grundhofer said in a statement announcing the deal. ""It's a natural fit for them,"" said Frank Barkocy, analyst at Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross. ""It's a natural extension of their marketplace."" First Bank said it expected pretax cost savings of about $340 million from the merger, with combined operating expenses being reduced by 14 percent. First Bank said it would take pretax charges of $625 million for costs related to the merger, which was expected to close by the end of June. While it was too soon to say specifically which jobs would be cut in the merger, the majority of jobs affected will be in the Portland area, bank officials said. Both banks have instituted hiring freezes to help minimize the number of people losing jobs, the banks said. First Bank said the deal was expected to add to its earnings per share starting in the second quarter of next year. By 1999, First Bank sees about an 8 percent addition to earnings per share. First Bank said it would be able to increase revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp's extensive corporate base. Home equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp's customers, while U.S. Bancorp's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers, the banks said. ""Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines,"" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group. Grundhofer will be president and chief executive of the new company, which will take the U.S. Bancorp name but remain based in Minneapolis. U.S. Bancorp Chairman Gerry Cameron will serve as chairman of the merged bank until his retirement in 1998. Since 1991, First Bank has made 23 acquisitions, including the $717 million acquisition of Nebraska-based FirsTier Financial Inc. in 1996. Cameron said he was first approached by Grundhofer about a deal in early November. ""I frankly told him he should go talk to someone else that was interested,"" Cameron told reporters during a conference call. But he said he felt a responsibility to shareholders to hear Grundhofer out and the two discussed the deal around Thanskgiving. After subsequent meetings and a review that ended last weekend, both sides were even more convinced the deal made sense, he said. ","BradDorfman"
"Tate &amp; Lyle Plc said Tuesday its U.S. subsidiary A.E. Staley continues to face reduced profit margins for high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener. Fructose contract prices for 1997, which largely have been set, are lower than a year ago, as are corn costs, said Larry Pillard, chief executive of London-based Tate &amp; Lyle. ""On a margin basis (factoring out corn cost changes) they are maybe slightly lower,"" Pillard told Reuters at an analysts' conference here.   Pillard blamed lower margins on overcapacity in the U.S. fructose industry. Staley's output accounts for a little over 20 percent of total U.S. fructose production. To balance the softness in fructose margins, Staley has shifted some output to other corn-based products, including ethanol, starch used by the paper industry, and specialty food starches.   ""In addition to that, we've continued our very aggressive cost-reduction initiatives at Staley,"" Pillard said. ""Yes, we'd like higher margins in fructose. But we're not completely dissatisfied with Staley. We're still very bullish on the corn refining business."" He added that U.S. fructose demand continues to grow by four to five percent a year. Pillard acknowledged that ""in a worst case scenario"" it may be another two or three years before demand in the U.S. catches up with fructose supplies.   But one promising variable is the potential for greater demand for fructose in Mexico. Beyond fructose, Tate &amp; Lyle is investing in number of value-added products, including a lactic acid plant it likely will build in the United States and a citric acid joint venture in India. Tate &amp; Lyle, as a producer of sweeteners and starches, is already expanding its global presence, with investments in developing markets. Those investments, which have totaled $250 million over the past few years and spread over four continents -- is projected to generate a return on invesment of over 20 percent after five years, according to Simon Gifford, group finance director for Tate &amp; Lyle. Investments have been made in Mexico, central and eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. Tate &amp; Lyle also is building a world-scale starch plant in northern France, which will use wheat as a raw material. ""That will be completed by the end of this calendar year,"" Gifford said. ""We will start getting returns after commissioning in the second half of next year."" 	 ((Chicago newsdesk 312 408-8787)) ","PatriciaCommins"
"A second wave of Chinese soldiers arrived in Hong Kong on Monday to prepare garrison facilities before Beijing takes back the territory from Britain on July 1. Sixty-six uniformed but unarmed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) drove into Hong Kong in a fleet of 14 staff vehicles from the Chinese border city of Shenzhen. Monday's group was the second PLA contingent in as many months to arrive in the territory under arrangements worked out by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group overseeing details of Hong Kong's sovereignty change. Forty soldiers entered on April 21 to prepare logistics and facilities before the eventual arrival on July 1 of the rest of the Chinese troops to be stationed in the territory. Major-General Liu Zhenwu, commander of the future garrison in Hong Kong, officiated a solemn send-off ceremony on the Chinese side of the border, according to the official Chinese Xinhua news agency. Liu urged the advance party ""to carry on the fine traditions of the PLA, and to perform the sacred duties entrusted to them by the country and people"". A handful of British soldiers and Chinese officers from the first advance group greeted the latest contingent on the Hong Kong side in a brief and low-key ceremony. Sporting dark blue berets and crisply-starched uniforms, the 66 PLA troops crossed over at 1.00 p.m. (0500 GMT) in a convoy comprising a large air-conditioned bus, green army trucks, jeeps and black Audi cars. Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to China on July 1 and the British garrison is already packing up ahead of its departure at midnight June 30. From July 1, the bustling capitalist city of 6.4 million will be guarded by the PLA. After the brief greetings, the British soldiers then climbed aboard the Chinese vehicles to help give directions to the Sek Kong military camp in the New Territories. Besides Sek Kong, the latest group will be stationed in the Prince of Wales Barracks, Stonecutters Island and Gun Club Hill Barracks, a Hong Kong government spokesman said. A third and final advance guard of 90 soliders is scheduled to arrive on May 30, bringing the total preparatory force of Chinese troops in Hong Kong to 196 before the handover. Many Hong Kong people are concerned about the presence of PLA troops in the territory because of the bloody military crackdown on activists in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. China plans to station some 10,000 troops in the territory after the handover, about the same number as the British garrison at its peak. But the Chinese officers have been careful to make sure that the troops who have already arrived are keeping a low profile. ","TanEeLyn"
"Britain's motor industry reported 1996 car registrations at a seven-year high on Tuesday, but admitted the figures masked problems of erratic retail sales, poor margins and the threat to exports posed by a surging pound. Manufacturers faced the double whammy of sluggish domestic retail sales as imports continue to rise, while British exports are now exposed to the new worry of a rising pound. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders put a brave face on car-makers' problems, pointing to 1996 new car registration growth of 4.12 percent on 1995 levels to 2,025,450 -- the third highest annual total on record. Registrations in December showed a monthly rise of 9.23 percent in December. But most of the annual growth was due to company fleet car sales and heavy discounting which has eaten into manufacturers' margins. Retail sales to private British buyers rose by a paltry 2.3 percent on the year. While the SMMT said 1997 would continue to show some growth, analysts said the industry could not afford to be hit by the stronger pound abroad while the home retail market remains erratic and the fleet car market is artificially boosted by heavy discounting. ""We continue to see a rise in imports and while exports did well (in 1996) they are facing tougher times ahead thanks to the pound,"" John Lawson, analyst at Salomon Brothers. Lawson said car-maker Rover Group, part of Germany's BMW, is the most exposed to sterling strength, with players like Ford Motors and General Motors better placed to switch some capacity or sourcing of components outside Britain if the pound continues to power ahead. On sterling's gains, Ernie Thompson, chief executive of the SMMT, said ""Obviously it's (sterling strength) a risk."" Arthur Maher, head of forecasting at analysts LMC International, said ""In the short term, UK exports are likely to impact on company financials rather than sales volumes."" ""If sterling appreciation looks structural, manufacturers may look to reduce vehicle specifications and renew efforts to boost productivity,"" he said. The sales trend in Britain has shown imports rise to take 62.03 percent of the British market, up from 58.94 percent in 1995. In 1994 imports took just 52.82 percent of British car sales. The SMMT said the upward import pattern is set to continue for the next two years. Analysts are also worried that retail sales have not moved in line with the consumer spending binge in other parts of the economy. Margaret Pyne, head of economics at the SMMT, said ""The erratic nature of retail demand was particularly disappointing."" Car retail sales did bounce back in the last quarter of 1996, but Maher said ""sales remain vulnerable to a post-election squeeze in 1997, with the retail consumer exposed."" An election is due by May, with the possibility of a fiscal tightening afterwards which could dampen consumer spending. Thompson warned that British car makers would continue to feel the pressure with ""intense competition and over-capacity hitting margins. Unless they start earning better profits it is difficult to see how they can afford to finance new models. That is a major concern throughout the world."" Analysts like Maher said car-makers faced the double bind of cut-throat competition and overcapacity coupled with a more demanding breed of consumer wanting up-to-date innovations at yesterday's prices.

"Russia's hot new reformer, Boris Nemtsov, is sparking changes at the Fuel and Energy Ministry he now heads, revamping the grey body in ways which could reshape output and exports by the world's third largest oil producer. Industry sources say Nemtsov, who is trimming the ministry's bloated staff and reorganising the Soviet-era institution to deal with new market realities, is moving to make Russian oil exports to Western markets more transparent. But Nemtsov also wants to keep Russia well supplied with oil products and prevent regional deficits which have arisen over the past year as producers boost exports at the expense of supplying domestic refineries. The streamlining envisaged by Russia's golden boy of reform includes fairer access to stretched-to-capacity export pipelines -- first-quarter oil exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States were up 7.2 percent from year-ago levels at 2.0 million barrels per day. ""The big question is 'Who will control access to export pipelines?'"" asked a senior Western oil industry source in Moscow. ""Moving administration of the pipeline system to a regulatory body is not a bad thing."" But Nemtsov, who is also a first deputy prime minister in charge of restructuring natural monopolies, including the Transneft oil pipeline outfit, is mindful of domestic needs. His hand-picked protege, Sergei Kiriyenko, a young banker brought on board as first deputy fuel and energy minister, said the ministry had a duty to keep everyone from domestic power plants to farmers adequately supplied with oil products. ""You can influence the producers only by creating specific stimuli, not by government telegrams,"" Kiriyenko told Wednesday's edition of the Kommersant business daily. ""Of course, there are coercive methods, like access to export pipelines. If we see Russia does not have enough oil products, then the volume of exported oil will be limited."" Kiriyenko said the ministry's priority was to bring balance into the domestic fuel and energy market and create desirable conditions for companies at home. Nemtsov, 38, was appointed Fuel and Energy Minister in April, taking responsibility for one of Russia's most strategic and highest-earning sectors under sweeping changes which put reformers in charge of the government. In a big overhaul, he divided the Fuel and Energy Ministry into two sections -- one in charge of operations, headed by Kiriyenko, and one dealing with investment, headed by Viktor Ott, a ministry old-timer liked by Western energy executives. Ott will deal with development licences and a supervisory body handling domestic fuel supply issues. Kommersant quoted Kiriyenko as saying the new team would change ""the obsolete position of the ministry"". The ministry's old way of functioning includes forcing oil producers to supply regions with oil products essentially for free and deciding how much oil companies can export. ""I can't say we've yet felt the effect of his changes, but it's fairly clear that when the process is over, the ministry will be vastly different than what it was before,"" said the Western executive. Kiriyenko said the ministry was in no position to lead Russia's newly privatised oil companies but should play a role in managing state shares in the new majors. Nemtsov, who met Western oil executives at the influential Moscow International Petroleum Club on Tuesday, was quoted by Kommersant as saying no single Russian oil producer would be allowed to account for more than 25 percent of total oil output. Western executives at the meeting said Nemtsov would fire half of the ministry's 800 or so bureaucrats, stripping away legions who delayed everything from talks for joint ventures to approval for exploration licences. ""We're going to create more attractive conditions for you,"" Kommersant quoted Nemtsov as telling the executives. ","LynnleyBrowning"
"A plan by disgruntled French luxury goods group LVMH to spin off the brewing, food and burger businesses in a planned merger between Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc is winning some analysts' sympathy. But Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, smarting from having been sidelined in a proposed 23.8 billion pound ($39.2 billion) merger despite his 14.2 percent Guinness stake, has taken the market by surprise. In two share raids he has snapped up a 6.29 percent stake in GrandMet and spent around 800 million pounds in an effort to leverage a better negotiating position, analysts said on Friday. He is now the largest shareholder in both of the hopeful merger partners. A merger between the two British giants to form a new group called GMG Brands brings together an empire stretching from Johnnie Walker and Bell's whisky, Gordon's Gin, Smirnoff Vodka, and Guinness' traditional stount to the Burger King fast food chain, Haagen Dazs ice-cream and Green giant canned vegetables. Despite some concerns that a hurried sale of unrelated businesses might not get the best or prices, most analysts expect GMG Brands to eventually spin off at least Burger King -- which one said stuck out like a ""sore thumb"". ""The fact is GrandMet has a spirits and food business together and there isn't any clear logical fit,"" noted one analyst, who declined to be named. ""So perhaps on that basis it would seem sensible to spin it off."" Analysts said the added value in the planned merger, which is awaiting European and U.S. regulatory clearance, was clearly in the spirits division. But the food businesses are also more than mere chicken feed. Excluding Burger King, they could be worth 5.0-6.0 billion pounds -- on conservative estimates, some said. And that cash could be spent in emerging markets in an earnings enhancing way. ""I think there is added value putting the sprits divisions together,"" noted another analyst. ""By spinning off the other pieces, LVMH...wants to capture as much of that extra value for its own shareholders as it possibly can."" Separately, credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's  on Friday placed its 'A-1'-plus commercial paper rating of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) on CreditWatch with negative implications following announcement of LVMH's increased stake in GrandMet and its intention to exercise its option to purchase the 34 percent stake in Moet Hennessy owned by Guinness PLC. S&amp;P said the acquisitions would place further pressure on the French company's existing financial profile, which had already been stretched in 1996 by the purchase of a 61 percent stake in Duty Free Shopping. It said the move also reflected uncertainties regarding the possibility that LVMH may further increase its stake in GrandMet to obtain a blocking position regarding the proposed Guinness merger. While Arnault piles up his bargaining chips amid mounting speculation that he may raise his GrandMet stake to 10 percent, U.S. competition authorities requested more information on the planned merger. The European Commission, which has until 2200 GMT to decide whether to conduct a second-stage probe, is expected to follow suit. In the meantime, Arnault can convene an extraordinary general meeting if he raises his stake to 10 percent, and put his views to shareholders and the board. But in order to block the bid, he needs more than 24 percent of GrandMet shares. While analysts and the companies are braced for LVMH's next move, few believe it realistic to expect the French company to buy such a large stake despite its threats. Such a move would push the price up too high, only to fall back significantly once the bid was blocked, they said. ""I don't think that's a viable strategy,"" noted one. While GrandMet was holed up in a meeting and unavailable to comment, Guinness said only that as far as it was concerned, it was pressing ahead with the merger. ""We are confident it will go through at the end of the year and we're watching the developments with interest,"" a company spokesman said. By 1210 GMT, GrandMet shares were trading at 598p, a loss of 5-1/2p, while Guinness stock slipped 6-1/2p to 598-1/2p. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ($ = 0.607 British Pounds) ","KirstinRidley"
"Shareholders of MCI Communications Corp are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favor of the proposed merger with British Telecommunications Plc at MCI's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday. The shareholder vote is one of the first major milestones on the road to winning approval for the $23 billion cross-border merger, which will create a combined company known as Concert Plc with $40.6 billion in revenues.   The merger awaits regulatory approvals in Washington, London and Brussels, the headquarters of the European Commission. Company officials are confident the merger -- announced in November 1996 -- is on track to close in the fall of 1997. The annual meeting, to be held in out-of-the-way Wilkes Barre, Pa., two hours north of Philadelphia, is expected to be a quiet affair, with only three items on the agenda: the shareholder vote, and election of directors and auditors. Wilkes Barre was chosen because it was the hometown of William McGowan, the legendary founder and former chairman of MCI, who died in June 1992.   In his speech to shareholders Wednesday, Bert Roberts, MCI's current chairman and chief executive, is expected to focus on the projected benefits of its merger, which would create one of the world's first global communications carriers. One industry analyst briefed by the company said he expected Roberts to reveal some of the early products and services that may result from its ties to British Telecom. Among the possible offerings would be seamless services connecting the United States and Britain, including wireless phone transmission, faxing, electronic mail, voice mail and the Internet, the analyst said.   Industry analysts believe the MCI official will also respond to AT&amp;T Corp's initiative to offer local phone service using a fixed wireless system attached to the side of a customer's premises as a means of bypassing local networks controlled by regional Bell companies. Through interconnection pacts and the new wireless technology, AT&amp;T has said by 1998 it plans to offer local service to the vast majority of the U.S. population.   MCI made an early move into local phone markets with its MCI Metro unit but has appeared less aggressive than its rivals since the passage of the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 in evolving a strategy to expand its local phone presence. A key benefit of the merger with cash-rich British Telecom is the financing muscle that MCI can tap as it seeks to slice substantial market share away from the incumbent regional Bell companies in various local service markets.   MCI provides local service in 20 U.S. metropolitan markets through a mix of company-owned facilities and resale agreements to use other companies' networks. It has said it plans to be in 31 local service markets by the end of 1997. By contrast, long-distance rivals AT&amp;T and Sprint Corp have each said they are gearing up to compete in the 50 top U.S. metropolitan markets by year-end. There are three nominees, all British, to the MCI board. They include Sir Peter Bonfield, British Telecom's chief executive and a current MCI board member; Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry and chairman of British Airways ; and J. Keith Oates, deputy chairman of British retail group Marks and Spencer Plc. Sources close to the company said they expected a favorable vote at the meeting, due in part to the substantial 20 percent stake that British Telecom already owns of MCI and the lack of opposition to the merger among other shareholders. The MCI vote will be followed April 15 by an extraordinary general meeting of British Telecom shareholders to be held at Wembley Stadium in London. ","EricAuchard"
"British tobacco-to-insurance group B.A.T Industries on Wednesday said it was confident a string of tobacco-related lawsuits in the United States would have no material impact on its bottom line. But chairman Lord Cairns said the company must brace itself for ""occasional reversals along the way, especially at the lower court level"". B.A.T's American subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson is facing a string of lawsuits, including 24 cases brought by individual states to recover funds spent on treating patients with tobacco-related illnesses. Speaking after the group released flat first quarter pre-tax profits, B.A.T chief executive Martin Broughton declined to comment on recent press reports that the industry may be in negotiations over a possible $300 billion settlement of the lawsuits. Broughton also would not comment on suggestions that the tobacco industry may be able to rely on insurance cover to offset the claims. The issue of insurance, he said, was complex both factually and legally, with many different policies containing many different exclusion clauses. Schroders insurance analyst Paul Hodges in a recent research note argued that loosely worded general liability insurance policies could open the way for claims by the tobacco industry against their insurance companies. On Wednesday, B.A.T reported a one million pound ($1.6 million) rise in group pre-tax profits to 591 million pounds in the first three months of the year. But the company repeated a warning made at last week's annual shareholders meeting that if the strength of the British currency persisted it may hold back the group's full-year results. B.A.T shares eased slightly after the broadly in-line figures, shedding 1-1/2 pence to 522-1/2 pence by early afternoon. Total trading profit from B.A.T's financial services business rose three percent to 266 million, with the general business slightly ahead at 142 million pounds and the life companies showing a six percent rise to 124 million pounds. In North America, insurer Farmers made an encouraging start to the year with all round business growth fuelling a six percent rise in profits to 163 million pounds. But market conditions remained difficult for B.A.T's British business where profits fell two million pounds to 77 million pounds. While the company expects further rises in premiums in the coming year, it anticipates increases to be limited. Asked about the recent consolidation in the industry Broughton said the company remained ""alert to acquisition opportunities"" but did not feel the need to do anything urgently. Re-emphasising comments made last year, he said, the group lacked a strong brand in the independent financial advisory segment of the market and that was likely to be the focus of the group's acqusition appetite. Total tobacco profit of 363 million pounds would have risen by eight percent but for a 22 million pound provision for the future closure of a cigarette factory in the German capital Berlin, which reduced the increase to two percent. Total group cigarette volumes rose slightly to 167 billion pounds, with good gains in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa and Europe more than compensating for reduced sales in North America. Tobacco profit from the America-Pacific region was lower at 140 million pounds in the first quarter. Reduced sales in a very competitive U.S. domestic market and the loss of contribution from the sale of brands disposed of at the end of 1996 as required by U.S. competition authorities, more than offset the benefit of last year's price increase. B.A.T's American subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson saw lower shipments and its market share fell to 16.3 percent from 17.5 percent, mainly due to the sale of the brands.

"The chairman of CSX Corp said he is ""reasonably confident, but guarded"" that Conrail shareholders will approve a key provision of the planned $9.2 billion railroad merger, adding that CSX will remain committed to the union even if the measure is defeated. John Snow also described rival bidder Norfolk Southern Corp's latest attempt to thwart the transaction as ""a desperate act."" Snow spoke to Reuters in a telephone interview.   Conrail shareholders will vote Friday on a provision that essentially will enable CSX to pay cash and stock for Conrail. Rival bidder Norfolk Southern, whose $10.3 billion offer was rejected by Conrail, late Monday offered to buy 9.9 percent of the railroad if shareholders defeat the measure. ""It seems to me like it's a desperate act. I can't imagine it's going to affect very much,"" Snow said. However, he admitted that the offer is probably creating some confusion in the market.   Snow said the Norfolk Southern offer likely resulted from two setbacks last week. A U.S. district court judge and the Surface Transportation Board both denied Norfolk Southern's attempt to block the merger. ""They had suffered two stinging defeats. They were probably reeling and felt the need to do something,"" Snow said. He declined to speculate on the outcome of Friday's vote, which is expected to be tallied by early next week. Under the proposed merger, neither Conrail or CSX can enter a partnership with another party before 1999.   Snow also reiterated court testimony that CSX will not raise the bid for Conrail. ""Once the Street becomes convinced that this is the deal, that there isn't any other deal, that this is the price, it seems to me that we'll ultimately win the vote,"" Snow said. If Conrail shareholders defeat the Friday vote, Conrail has the ability to call a new meeting. ""If we lose it, I think it's going to be shame on us for not having communicated fully the benefits of this merger. What I propose doing, if we lost it...would be to take our time and patiently go around and talk to the shareholders -- that may take three months, that may take six months -- until they really understood the merger,"" he said. Snow said he spoke earlier on Tuesday with Conrail chairman David LeVan. ""They're firmly committed to us. We're firmly committed to them. We certainly hope we win the vote. If we don't win the vote, we're still committed to each other. We have a contract that's binding for two years,"" Snow added. ","RobinSidel"
"Hong Kong's democracy movement leader Martin Lee made a triumphant return to the territory on Monday after upstaging future leader Tung Chee-hwa by winning support from Washington for political freedoms. The head of the Hong Kong Democratic Party became a media star in the United States where he clinched a White House meeting with President Bill Clinton, who promised U.S. support after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1. Jubilant and relaxed after a hectic month-long, 12-city tour to the United States, Canada and Switzerland, Lee said he was convinced Hong Kong had friends throughout the world who were anxious to preserve its freedoms after China takes over. Lee said governments in the West had a moral responsibility to see that China abides by its treaty pledge of allowing Hong Kong's freewheeling lifestyle to endure for another 50 years. Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to Chinese rule at midnight June 30 under a 1984 treaty. The Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's handover promises the territory quasi autonomy in all areas except defence and foreign affairs. But many in the bustling territory of 6.4 million fear a loss of fundamental freedoms after the handover, now just 71 days away. The territory is plagued by a host of handover woes ranging from China's plan to replace the elected legislature with one carefully crafted by Beijing, to curbs on protests and a ban on foreign funding for political groups. Lee, whose return coincided with the arrival of an advance party of China's army to prepare for the coming of the rest of the garrison on July 1, told Hong Kong people to take heart. ""We're not fighting alone for human rights and democracy in Hong Kong. We have many friends in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and Europe,"" he said. ""People are very concerned about Hong Kong and preservation of its freedoms as guaranteed by the Joint Declaration. ""We reminded the U.S. government and all other governments that supported the Joint Declaration...they owe Hong Kong at least a moral responsibility to make sure the rule of law, civil liberties are preserved after the sovereignty changeover."" Last week at the White House, Lee won an assurance that Hong Kong was important to the United States and a warning from Clinton to China to abide by its Joint Declaration commitments. Lee's return, after scoring his political victory in Washington, provided a counterpoint to the falling popularity of future leader Tung, who will govern Hong Kong from July 1. Sharply criticised for his plans to ban foreign funding of political groups and curb protests, Tung found himself the subject of a scandal after he admitted having donated 50,000 sterling (US$81,500) to Britain's Conservative Party in 1992. Lee vowed he and his party members would not give up their fight to preserve Hong Kong's freedoms, but he admitted he was deeply worried that Tung would press ahead with his plans. ""If Mr Tung stops us, and (the plans) become law, we will have to decide what to do,"" he said. Lee's party raised HK$2.5 million (US$323,000) from Chinese communities during its month-long tour. (US$1 = HK$7.73) ","TanEeLyn"
"Hong Kong's colonial government cautioned Beijing on Monday not to cause constitutional problems by enacting laws for the territory before Britain hands it back to China at midnight on June 30. Security Secretary Peter Lai said Beijing might spark a flurry of lawsuits that would work against its declared aim of a smooth transition for Hong Kong. Lai's warning came after Hong Kong's future lawmakers from a China-appointed provisional legislature said they would develop laws for the territory before July 1, which marks the end of more than 150 years of British colonial rule. Residency rights, or the so-called ""right of abode"", in Hong Kong after the handover are among the issues China wants the body to decide before the handover, but the Hong Kong government is opposed, Lai said. ""We clearly cannot accept this because there can only be one legislature for Hong Kong before July 1, and that is the legally constituted Legislative Council of Hong Kong which exists today,"" Lai told reporters. But the Hong Kong government warning appeared unlikely to worry China. Lu Ping, Beijing's top official on Hong Kong matters, said the right of abode issue was an internal affair because it concerned China's nationality laws. ""The provisional legislature does not need the approval of the British government,"" Lu told reporters. The 60-member provisional legislature that Beijing intends to install in place of the elected council faces fierce opposition from the pro-democracy camp. Democrats have vowed to sue the body if it tries to make laws before July 1. While Britain and China have agreed on major provisions on the right of abode, they are deadlocked on actual legislation. ""Immigration/nationality matters are a notoriously litigious area...if decisions have to be taken on the basis of legislation processed by the provisional legislature before July 1, they would attract a huge amount of litigation which could paralyse the immigration system in Hong Kong after June 30,"" Lai said. ""That would be highly unconducive to a smooth transition."" The issue on right of abode in Hong Kong after July 1 is close to the hearts of 750,000 Hong Kong people who have obtained foreign citizenship in recent years but who also value their permanent residency rights in Hong Kong. Uncertainty has prompted a scramble for air tickets among migrants anxious to land in Hong Kong before midnight June 30. Emigrants can establish permanent right of abode in Hong Kong if they return within 18 months of the handover, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing said. Hong Kong Chinese will retain Hong Kong permanent residency status unless they stay away for more than 36 months before resettling in the territory, a spokesman for the office said. Rita Fan, president of the interim legislature, vowed to press on and make the draft right of abode bill into law. ","TanEeLyn"
"AT&amp;T Corp. on Wednesday said basic U.S. rates for state-to-state calls made from a home would rise by 5.9 percent effective Dec 1., adding an average 60 cents a month to the typical residential bill. The company said it was raising rates to pay for investments made to broaden its service line, build technical infrastructure and improve customer service. Small business call rates will rise 4.8 percent for international, toll free and some other services. The Basking Ridge, N.J.-based company is raising the cost of calls made with a calling card by 5 percent and those made with the assistance of an AT&amp;T operator by 2.6 percent. It also said it would increase monthly fees on its Reach Out America, SelectSaver and AnyHour Saver calling plans. AT&amp;T said it stopped marketing those plans in 1993 when it introduced its ""True"" family of calling plans. However, rates on the True savings plans will also rise, an AT&amp;T spokesman confirmed, because they are based on a percentage discount from the basic rate. The new One Rate plan introduced this fall will not be affected as it is flat rate. AT&amp;T stock rose 62.5 cents to $39 on the New York Stock Exchange. AT&amp;T last raised rates in February, with a 4.3 percent increase. The previous increase was in December 1994. ""This is a real turkey for consumers,"" said Samuel Simon, founder and now outside counsel to Telecommunmications Research &amp; Action Centre, a consumer group that has monitored long-distance rates since the breakup of AT&amp;T in 1984. ""It is hard to believe market conditions justify yet another rate increase for long-distance customers. Residential rates have been steadily rising for nearly five years, and now AT&amp;T announces a major rate increase the day before Thanksgiving, to take effect four days later."" Asked earlier why announcement of the latest rate hike was made Wednesday, when most peoples' attention was on Thursday's Thanskgiving holiday, an AT&amp;T spokesman said, ""It is a coincidence."" Analysts said the increases continue the policy adopted by most big long-distance companies of increasing basic long-distance rates while promoting more generous calling plans to satisfy those customers who are price-sensitive. ""In the last three or four years long-distance prices have actually been going up,"" said industry analyst Jeffrey Kagan, who runs his own consulting firm. He said that AT&amp;T and others were trying to build up some fat ahead of the battle in 1997, when regional Bells are expected to drive into long-distance markets in force and push rates lower. In the meantime, he said, it pays for customers to take a hard look once a year at the call rates they are paying, and to choose the calling plan best for them. ""Only a third of long-distance customers are actually on calling plans at all, and it is the rest who are paying the freight,"" Kagan said. AT&amp;T also launched a cut-rate, international call-back service in Tokyo on Wednesday. In a call-back service, users first call a switching centre in the United States and calls are then connected at cost-effective U.S. rates. The Tokyo call-back service marks the first time AT&amp;T has started such a service, AT&amp;T Asia/Pacific President John Legere said. ""We are the first major telecommunications carrier in Japan to introduce a low-cost, flat-rate international calling option,"" he said. AT&amp;T's Japanese unit said it would charge 240 yen ($2) for a three-minute call to Canada or the United States from Tokyo, compared with the 450 yen ($3) Japanese customers now pay. The service, which will at first be offered only to business customers in Tokyo, could be used for sending data and faxes, Legere said. ","NickLouth"
"The consortium building the Sydney 2000 Olympic stadium on Thursday closed the books on an innovative funding scheme that turned into one of Australia's biggest market flops. Stadium Australia had hoped to offset some of its A$660 million (US$515 million) construction costs through the sale of 34,400 ""Gold Passes"" giving investors a mixture of Olympic tickets, equity and stadium membership. But investors and sports fans alike shunned the A$364.4 million (US$286.05 million) offer, leaving underwriters facing a massive funding shortfall. Analysts and local media put the gap at up to A$240 million, which would make it one of Australia's biggest share flops and mean big losses for the four firms that underwrote the issue. A spokeswoman for Stadium Australia said it expected to release the results of the float late next week, even though the issue officially closed on Thursday afternoon. Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) president Michael Knight, who is also Olympics minister in the New South Wales government, agreed on Thursday that the Stadium Australia float likely fell short. ""It is not a direct concern to either the government or to SOCOG, although obviously we would prefer that the stadium float was better subscribed than is apparently the case,"" Knight told reporters. The disappointment comes hard on the heels of the unexpected departure of SOCOG chief executive Mal Hemmerling, although the issue was unrelated. Hemmerling was replaced by Sandy Hollway, who worked for former prime minister Bob Hawke. It also follows financial difficulties experienced by the Australian Olympic Committee, which has lost millions of dollars investing in a Queensland casino. The Stadium Australia offer has been open for almost six months, more than twice as long as most share offers. Its offer of 34,400 gold packages at A$10,000 each and 600 platinum passes at A$33,000 each opened on October 7, and its closing date has been extended twice due to lack of demand. The gold packages include a seat at every stadium session of the 2000 Olympic Games, stadium membership for 30 years and 1,000 shares in the stadium company itself. The platinum package includes two priority seats and membership privileges. Australian stockbrokers said the offer was too expensive given that average income in Australia was only A$36,000. ""Nobody is going to buy just one ticket, with a family you are more likely to buy four, so it's going to cost A$40,000,"" said one Sydney-based broker. ""Not many people can spend that sort of money, particularly if there is no guarantee on what events are going to be held there after the Olympics,"" the broker said. The four underwriters of the stadium offer are ANZ Securities, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Macquarie Bank Ltd and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett. ""If there is a shortfall, (and) that appears to be the case, after today they will still have a considerable period of time to trade their way out of trouble,"" Knight said of the four. The underwriters must fund the project regardless of whether all the packages are sold, thus guaranteeing the completion of the 110,000-seat stadium, which is due to open in 1999 in time for a season of pre-Olympic competitions. ""The money is absolutely guaranteed, the stadium construction is rocketing ahead and will not be affected in any way by the difficulties the underwriters are facing in recouping the money,"" Knight said. The stadium is being built by a consortium led by private Australian construction group Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd, British investment bank Hambros Plc and Japanese building contractor Obayashi Corp.

"An Australian biotechnology firm has registered what it claims to be a unique vaccine against the world-wide problem of salmonella poisoning in chickens and hopes to register the vaccine for cattle as well. The vaccine, registered with Australia's National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Vetinerary Chemicals, is the only salmonella vaccine able to be used on chicken eggs, Bioproperties Australia Pty Ltd said on Wednesday.   ""There's no vaccine in the world that can do that presently,"" said managing director David Tinworth, who estimated total annual sales of ""tens of millions of dollars"" if the vaccine was able to be sold internationally. ""We can actually inject this vaccine into the egg before it hatches because most of the salmonella spread into the poulty industry are in the hatcher,"" he told Reuters. Bioproperties has successfully trialled the genetically manipulated vaccine in both chickens and cattle, the national government's Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, which oversaw the trials, confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday.   The company has also applied to register the vaccine domestically for use in cattle, Tinworth told Reuters. ""The registration is in process,"" he added. Vaccine sales into the poultry industry will begin at the end of this year, and Bioproperties plans to begin sales into local dairy and cattle industries within 18 months, he said. ""We are seeking registration in the whole of Europe (through the European Community) and the U.S.,"" Tinworth said. To develop the vaccine, Bioproperties secured a sub-licence on a patent registered in the United States for a technique known as gene depletion, he said.   Bioproperties sub-contracted the vaccine research work to the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, which used the patented gene-depletion technique to develop a benign salmonella bacterium which stimulated the immune system. Unlike existing salmonella vaccines, the gene-depleted vaccine carries no risk of inducing salmonella infection, Tinworth said. ""This vaccine is totally safe in the sense that it cannot cause salmonelosis,"" he added. Bioproperties will pay royalties on sales to both the U.S. patent-holder Praxis and the institute.   It is now working with Wyeth Australia Ltd, a unit of U.S. pharmaceutical group American Home Products Corp, to register a salmonella vaccine for humans, Tinworth said. Such a vaccine would be well suited for use on immuno-supressed people such as AIDS sufferers, he added. However, the company's initial market will be the huge poultry market, which slaughters an estimated 22 billion broilers each year, Tinworth said, adding the vaccine would be priced below current poultry vaccines at one U.S. cent per dose. -- Melbourne Bureau 613-286-1421 ","MarkBendeich"
"Trade ministers from the Asia Pacific region agreed on Saturday to work toward free trade in financial services and expanding open markets for information technology. The Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum wrapped up its three-day trade ministers' meeting in Montreal, agreeing to look for ways to expand last year's information technology deal to include more products and more countries. In the information technology sector, ""there are a number of both non-tariff measures and tariff measures that we might take up and we're hopeful that we'll see significant progress later this year,"" deputy U.S. trade representative Jeff Lang told a news conference. But Lang would not supply details on the kind of progress he hoped to see. The information technology agreement included 41 countries and 91 percent of world trade now, but Lang said four or five more countries were interested. The ministers also announced they were committed to forging a final financial services deal by December. ""Clearly what I'm hearing from the 18 members of APEC is that they want it to work this time,"" Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton said after the final news conference. Eggleton chaired the three-day meeting since Canada will host the APEC summit scheduled for Vancouver in November. Previous talks on an international agreement on financial services fell through last year after the United States pulled out because of its disappointment in offers from some other countries. And U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned on Saturday that some countries in Latin America and Asia need to be more generous with their offers. ""The United States will put forward an MFN (most favored nation) consistent offer, but it will be conditional on achieving a critical mass in the Asian countries and Latin America,"" she told reporters. Among the 18 APEC members, some of them will have progressive offers in time for the WTO deadline of mid-July, Barshefsky said. ""There are others who have shown reluctance. The same with Latin America,"" she said. ""These offers are going to have to be good, or the United States will seek an MFN exemption."" Such an exemption would likely stall progress on the talks. Last month, the United States said a financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice. It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial service providers, the United States said. Chile's Trade Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said his country would do its best to make a good financial services offer. ""We are prepared to make our offer and try to improve it, if it's possible,"" Insulza told a news conference. The world's major trading powers have agreed to put forward requests on financial services commerce by mid-June and offers by July 14 in the hopes of finalizing a deal by the end of December. The United States and Canada emphasized the role APEC should take in isolating certain trade sectors, liberalizing them within APEC and then putting them on to the agenda at the World Trade Organization. APEC agreements are voluntary, while WTO deals are binding. But the lesser developed countries that form a large part of APEC's membership appeared to place sectoral liberalization on a lower pedestal than the developed countries. Instead, they emphasized unilateral and voluntary plans to knock down trade barriers. ""I think we have to emphasize that the system talks about individual action plans as well as sectoral liberalization,"" said Cesar Bautista, the trade minister for the Phillipines. Malaysia and Indonesia both stressed the need to help small and medium sized businesses develop trading strategies. They said they appreciated APEC's progress on cutting customs red tape and promoting international investment in infrastructure. ","HeatherScoffield"
"Microsoft Corp. stock surged 10 percent to a record close Friday, a day after the software giant reported an 85 percent increase in quarterly earnings, smashing Wall Street estimates. Microsoft jumped $9.50 to $107.625 on Nasdaq and was by far the most active issue with nearly 29 million shares changing hands. While Microsoft keeps expectations low and then routinely surpasses them, analysts were stunned by the results reported late Thursday from the latest quarter, which included earnings that were 23 percent higher than estimates. ""I think it's the best quarter I've ever seen,"" said Scott McAdams, who has watched the company for years as an analayst at Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. ""I was floored."" As they always do, Microsoft executives warned they could not sustain the current pace, and analysts agreed growth will slow over the next five quarters, particularly when the company faces comparisons with the period that just ended. But coupled with better-than-expected earnings from its hardware ally Intel Corp., Microsoft's results reflect fundamental strength in the personal computer industry, analysts said. ""The combination of very strong returns from Microsoft and very strong returns from Intel certainly indicates we're still in an upswing, and I dont believe we've hit the maximum level,"" said Rob Enderle, senior analyst with Giga Information Group. He and other analysts said the strong sales were being driven by a shift to 32-bit operating systems and applications led by Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system and its Office 97 desktop programmes. While Windows 95 has been on the market for 20 months, ""the original uptake was not that dramatic,"" particularly among corporate users, said Drew Brosseau of Cowen &amp; Co. He said only 20 percent of large organisations had moved to a 32-bit desktop from the older 16-bit DOS and Windows operating systems by the end of 1996. But last year's release of Microsoft's Windows NT version 4.0 cleared a ""logjam"" and triggered the current sales surge by allowing corporate managers to make an informed choice between Microsoft's two main operating systems, Brosseau said. ""It's pretty clear that momentum is going to continue through the end of the year,"" Brosseau said. Meanwhile, Microsoft has another ace up its sleeve in its line of server software for corporate networks, led by the Windows NT Server operating system and the BackOffice group of applications. Analyst Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs estimated sales of Microsoft's business systems would rise to $1.5 billion this year from $750 million last year. Sherlund was among many analysts who raised Microsoft earnings estimates for the current quarter and fiscal 1998, which begins July 1. First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, said 17 analysts raised estimates to an average of $3.10 a share for fiscal 1998, compared with a previous consensus of $2.72. For the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, the analysts raised estimates to an average $2.62, up from a previous consensus of $2.34. For its fiscal third quarter ending March 31, Microsoft reported earnings of $1.04 billion or 79 cents a share, compared with $562 million or 44 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of 64 cents a share. Revenue for the quarter rose to $3.21 billion from $2.21 billion, smashing estimates the company would bring in $2.9 billion in revenues.

"British defence and industrial giant General Electric Co Plc saw its half year profits hit by a restructuring charge on Friday to cover an internal shake-up which includes a string of disposals and up to 1,000 job cuts. Half year pretax profits slumped to 261 million pounds ($423.6 million) from 402 million after the 160 million pounds charge. Underlying profit growth was meagre once again, rising 4.7 percent to 421 million pounds. The interim dividend payout was 3.26 pence versus 3.10 pence per share last year. In the first set of results delivered since George Simpson took over as head of the group from veteran managing director Lord Weinstock, GEC said the 160 million charge was being levied ""for the restructuring of existing and acquired businesses"" as well as marking down assets in its industrial group before sale. GEC's shares were slightly lower after the results, trading down four and a half pence at 361 pence in a tumbling market. ""All in all, the GEC results are a bit disappointing,"" one analyst who declined to be named said. ""The headline profits figure was just in line, the dividend increase wasn't very generous and the exceptional was unexpected."" David Newlands, finance director, said there could be up to 1,000 jobs cut at the newly acquired AG Power Transmission and Distribution and Hazeltine Corp of the U.S. The related redundancy and closure cost is expected to be 45 million pounds of the total 160 million charge revealed earlier. Another 50 million of that total relates to asset write-downs at two unnamed units earmaked for sale. ""We've had many offers for companies in the industrial group over the years -- all have been well above the book value, except for these two,"" said Newlands. He said the move was necessary in order to dispose of the two divisions with a string of other divestments. The first sale is expected to take place before Christmas. ""We are trying to accelerate the disposal programme. But is takes two to tango,"" he added. The rest of the charge announced in Friday's results relates to restructuring within remaining firms. In a divisional breakdown of the results, chairman Lord Prior said electronic systems and defence reported progress, with margins and profits ahead. ""GEC Alsthom maintained sales and profits in line with expectations. Telecommunications, consumer goods, office equipment and printing, medical equipment, industrial apparatus and distribution and trading all contributed higher profits,"" said the chairman. But the Gilbarco unit in the U.S. saw a profit fallback. Weak world demand for semiconductors also hit electronic components. Newlands said he did not expect that market to recover until the spring or summer of 1997. ($1=.6161 Pound) ","EdnaFernandes"
"Australia's powerful Maritime Union launched rolling bans on Indonesian shipping on Wednesday to protest against the arrest of Indonesian labour leaders and Canberra's ""failure"" to press Jakarta on human rights. The lightning bans, called at short notice and designed to hold up ships for 24 hours, could apply on an irregular basis to all types of commodity exports to Indonesia, the union said. Jakarta said the union's move could hurt bilateral ties. ""Such kind of incidents are regretted and will harm the efforts to build up relations between the two countries,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl said in Jakarta. ""Probably this kind of thing will have the strongest reaction from the business sector who are most affected,"" Fadyl told Reuters. He declined to comment further. Indonesia, Australia's nearest Asian neighbour, bought A$2.4 billion (US$1.9 billion) worth of Australian commodities in 1995, covering grains, minerals, livestock and refined petroleum. ""The bans are to protest against the recent arrests of independent labour leaders Muchtar Pakpahan and Dita Sari and the continuing repression following the July riots in Jakarta,"" the union said in a statement. The bans were also a response to Australian Prime Minister John Howard's failure in Jakarta this week to press Indonesia on the issue of human rights and democracy, the union said. During his visit to Indonesia, Howard reaffirmed Australia's commitment to close ties. The first ship to be hit by the rolling bans will be the Bogasari Empat, due to arrive in Fremantle on Australia's west coast late on Wednesday to load 32,500 tonnes of wheat. The ship will load wheat as scheduled but will be delayed for 24 hours before being able to depart, union assistant secretary Vic Slater told Reuters. ""It delays things,"" Slater said of the bans. ""In terms of the economy, I don't think it has any effect on the Australian economy."" Pakpahan, leader of the Indonesian Labour Welfare Union (SBSI), has been charged with subversion in connection with riots that rocked the Indonesian capital on July 27. The crime of subversion is punishable by death. Five people died and 149 were injured in the Jakarta riots, Indonesia's official Human Rights Commission has said. Scores of buildings were set ablaze in the unrest, which was the worst in Jakarta since anti-Japanese riots there in 1974. The riots followed a police raid on the headquarters of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to evict supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, who had been ousted as party leader by a government-backed faction the previous month. Labour activist Dita Sari was arrested before the July 27 riots over a labour strike in Surabaya, media reports have said. The Australian rolling bans are in line with a world-wide campaign against Pakpahan's arrest by the International Transport Workers' Federation, which represents more than five million workers in 120 countries, the Maritime Union said. ""Muchtar Pakpahan is an independent and moderate union leader who has even won the respect of the U.S. embassy (in Jakarta),"" Slater said. U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord met Pakpahan in his Jakarta cell last Friday. The Maritime Union has 10,000 members working around Australia as seamen and waterside workers. ","MarkBendeich"
"Hong Kong's business and political leaders are gearing up to face a tough new world when the handover party is over. Surrounded by rival Asian tiger economies, the territory can no longer rely on its historic role as the outside world's gateway to China to maintain its position as the world's seventh biggest trading economy. ""Our economic challenge is to improve Hong Kong's competitiveness in the new world order,"" future chief executive Tung Chee-hwa said in an interview with the South China Morning Post. A quick glance at rivals Singapore, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo has convinced Hong Kong's new leaders that drastic action is necessary. Tung said Hong Kong had to become ""more compassionate and caring"" and tackle problems in education, housing and care of the elderly. ""Only if we succeed in meeting these challenges can we sustain our economic vitality and thereby continue to create wealth and improve the quality of life of all the people of Hong Kong,"" he declared. ""LIVELIHOOD"" ISSUES AT THE FOREFRONT Tung's blend of economic and social policy into ""livelihood"" issues masks controversy over the prospect of government intervention in an economy dubbed the world's freest. With a cash pile of HK$330 billion (US$42 billion) in reserves, Tung and his advisers have plenty of ammunition to fire at improvement targets. Easy access to the cheap labour regions of southern China allowed Hong Kong's manufacturing base to explode and multiply when China opened its doors to foreign investment in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Once a manufacturing base dependent on exports of labour-intensive, low-value goods, Hong Kong has been transformed into a service centre geared to China's emergence. Manufacturing's contribution to Hong Kong's gross domestic product has plunged to single digits from more than 50 percent in the 1970s. Meanwhile, services have soared to 85 percent of GDP and are rising. The speed of this process has amazed economists around the world -- and has created a new set of challenges for Hong Kong. WAGES, PROPERTY CRUSH The most obvious is a shortage of skilled workers. ""We need people, not machinery,"" George Leung, economic adviser at Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, said. ""This is the most serious issue in Hong Kong."" Wage rates are rising, putting pressure on inflation rates even while unemployment rises -- a new phenomenon. Demand is switching from high-labour, low-skilled jobs to white-collar occupations such as accountants, lawyers, managers and investment bankers. The education system is ill-suited. Business leaders have called for government action to address a shortage of schools and properly qualified teachers. ""It's not a question of dumping money at the problem,"" Leung said. ""We need to come up with a helpful programme to train people and raise their quality. Otherwise, we will have no resources to expand our economy."" With China's economy expected to double within the decade, Leung believes Hong Kong could face critical labour shortages in the next 10 years unless it acts aggressively now. Rivals Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Tokyo are waiting to pounce on failure. Tung has appointed one adviser to draw up a detailed education policy and asked another for guidance on how to tackle Hong Kong's critical property shortage. Both wages and property make a major contribution to high costs, Hong Kong's major handicap in the competitiveness stakes. Rents and wages are higher than virtually anywhere else in Asia.

"Boeing Co. may take over maintenance operations for some of its airline customers as part of a drive by the jet manufacturer to develop new business opportunities, a company spokeswoman said Friday. Boeing Enterprises, a new division of the company's commercial airplane group, is looking at maintenance as ""one of many"" new business opportunities, spokeswoman Barbara Murphy said. ""There are things that make it very logical for us to pursue this new business opportunity,"" she said. ""We have an advantage. We know our airplanes better than anyone."" The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Boeing was pushing to take over the heavy-maintenance operations of several major carriers, possibly including British Airways Plc. Murphy declined to comment on any specific deals, and a spokeswoman for British Airways also declined comment. Industry analysts said a move by Boeing into maintenance would make sense as a way to diversify the company's business beyond highly cyclical airplane manufacturing and weapons systems. ""If you can get into that business without stepping on your customer's toes I think it's a great idea,"" said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities. He and other analysts said the move was a reflection of Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit's efforts to diversify Boeing while the manufacturer is enjoying a record wave of new orders. ""This is a reflection of Phil Condit and his more aggressive nature than his predecessor and a reflection of the internal thinking that's going on as to where best could they deploy the huge amount of cash they're going to have on hand,"" said Paul Nisbet of JSA Research. Boeing had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of last year, and Nisbet estimated that with the company's expected acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. this year it will generate at least $1.5 billion in excess cash annually over the next several years. Last month Boeing Enterprises announced a $200 million joint venture with FlightSafety International to offer pilot and ground crew training. FlightSafety is a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The Boeing unit, formed in January, also has been exploring ways to profitably use the company's massive database of world airline inventories to help carriers maintain service records. Boeing was off $1.75 at $100.375 on the New York Stock Exchange amid a drop of 148 points, or more than 2 percent, in the Dow Jones industrial average. ","MartinWolk"
"Shanghai's port will be expanded to improve container handling and the approach channels will be deepened to accommodate large container ships, the port director said on Friday. The port's container throughput rose 29 percent to 1.97 million units last year and should rise by a further 21 percent to 2.3 million units this year, director Du Deming said. ""The aim is to reach three million units by the end of the century but we could surpass that, we are doing the preparatory work to meet this challenge,"" Du said in an interview. Shanghai port, China's largest, has been hampered for more than a century by shallow approach channels and silt build-up from the Yangtze River. Despite continual dredging the approches are only seven metres deep. ""We need to deepen the approaches by five metres, through a combination of engineering and dredging, to bring the depth of the approaches to 12.5 metres,"" Du said. ""The plan is to achieve this within the next 10 years. It will be a big project with several phases,"" he added. Du declined to estimate the amount of investment required to achieve the plan, saying it was under study. ""Water depth is one of our biggest problems. We need to deepen the approaches as soon as possible to allow in the third-, fourth- and even fifth-generation container ships which can hold 5,000 containers and more,"" Du said. Fifth-generation container vessels have visited Shanghai, but never fully loaded. Du said investment in new facilities and reconstruction in Shanghai port would drop somewhat this year below last year's 1.1 billion yuan ($132 million), but that investment would resume growing in 1998. He declined to give details. He said the port was trying to improve efficiency and had brought average ship turn-around times down to two days last year, a 10 percent improvement over 1995. ""We are inevitably competing for business with other ports in the region, and ship owners and cargo owners can make their own choice,"" he said. ""We need to improve facilities, equipment and particularly information systems."" But Du said he did not see Shanghai port as competing with Hong Kong, which last year handled 13 million standard containers, more than six times the throughput of Shanghai. ""There is not much conflict. China is such a big country that both ports can continue to be prosperous. Hong Kong basically handles the south of the country, and Shanghai the Yangtze basin,"" he said. Development of the deep-water port of Ningbo port 200 km (125 miles) south of Shanghai has often been tipped as the answer to the port congestion and silting that dog Shanghai, but Du was cautious on the issue. ""We're looking into it,"" he said. ""Shanghai and Ningbo should both be developed, there is not enough capacity in either to meet the demand."" ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"A Chinese court on Thursday rejected a plea of insanity by a bank robber and sentenced him to death, along with two accomplices, for a string of heists that shocked Beijing. In a rare move, officials allowed foreign reporters to watch the court proceedings against Guo Song and seven accessories, apparently to trumpet the success of a crackdown on crime launched this year. The stocky Guo appeared unrepentant, his face set and defiant, as he was led from the courtroom by two policemen after the Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court convicted him of robbing three bank cash delivery vans this year. ""The court does not believe or accept defendant Guo Song's plea of insanity,"" the presiding judge said in his verdict. ""After psychiatric tests, Guo Song was found to have total control over his mental faculties and was responsible for his actions during the crime,"" said the judge, whose name was not available. The 32-year-old defendant, dressed in a beige jacket and dark blue trousers, did not speak during the 20-minute hearing. He has two weeks in which to file an appeal to the Higher People's Court. The presiding judge stood to read the verdict against the eight defendants lined up in front of him and each flanked by two police officers who held their arms at their sides. Guo, who had previously served a four-year term for rape, was found guilty of three bank robberies in Beijing in February, June and August this year, and of shooting dead four bank guards. The robberies shocked the Chinese capital, where bank heists had been unheard of since the 1949 communist takeover. The court sentenced two co-defendants to death for selling firearms to Guo. A fourth defendant was given a death sentence suspended for two years and a fifth was sentenced to life imprisonment for selling firearms. Three others, including Zhang Ying, 25, were sentenced to prison terms of up to seven years for harbouring a criminal. Zhang was the lone woman among the defendants. Police tracked down Guo last September after police detained an accomplice of Guo's in the robberies, Lu Xianzhou, while he was driving a stolen car, state media reported. Lu confessed to robbing the cash delivery vans and customers of banks and led police to Guo. It was not known if Lu has been sentenced. Police had recovered six guns, 350 rounds of ammunition and part of the stolen cash -- 170,000 yuan ($20,000), 610,000 Japanese yen ($5,000) and $18,000. Hundreds of thousands of people have been arrested and several thousand executed since China launched its Strike Hard crackdown against crime last April. Crime, virtually eliminated after the communists swept to power in 1949, has staged a comeback in the past two decades, springing up along with economic reforms that have loosened central controls while opening up opportunities for abuse of power. Illegal possession of firearms and gunrunning are widespread in China. The crime rate has soared, and 395 policemen were killed in the line of duty in 1995. ","BenjaminKangLim"
"Media mogul Rupert Murdoch treks to Capitol Hill Thursday to make a public pitch for his $1 billion Sky satellite-broadcast venture as a powerful new competitor to cable television. ""He's going to sound like the savior. He's going to present himself like the savior. Members of Congress will watch and applaud. But we'd better watch our wallets,"" said Stephen Effros, president of the Cable Telecommunications Association, a trade group representing cable operators. Murdoch has been lobbying Congress to pass legislation that would benefit his new venture, to be formed through a 50 percent stake in Colorado-based EchoStar Communications Corp. On Thursday he is expected to appeal to a Senate Commerce Committee hearing for help to make Sky a potent force to cable operators, whose subscription rates have leaped at more than double the rate of inflation over the past year. Cable companies are worried -- insiders have dubbed Sky ""Deathstar"" -- and the industry is rallying to battle the Murdoch venture on the legislative and regulatory fronts. Effros complained that Murdoch is trying to ""violate every public policy in this country to protect against the power he's accumulating."" A spokesman for Murdoch's News Corp. was not available to comment. Sky is set to be running in early 1998. It is expected to offer more than 500 channels of high-quality digital TV, Internet services, and retransmission of local TV broadcasts representing more than 75 percent of U.S. TV households. Direct broadcast satellite operators -- whose customers receive the service over a pizza-sized dish -- have nearly 5 million subscribers, up from practically zero three years ago. Murdoch and other satellite broadcast companies want a big chunk of the cable industry's 65 million subscribers. Industry analysts believe Murdoch is in a position to do so. ""He comes in with a lot of motivation, a lot of capital, a lot of experience, and a lot of chutzpah,"" said analyst Jimmy Schaeffler of The Carmel Group in Carmel, Calif. Murdoch also is using his political weight to convince lawmakers to pass legislation to clarify the copyright laws so Sky can retransmit local TV station signals to its customers. Other satellite broadcast companies do not provide the broadcasts. To outflank opponents, Murdoch wants to attach the measure to a must-pass $4 billion spending package that appropriates money for U.S. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and disaster relief, according to congressional and industry sources. The effort has run into opposition from lawmakers such as Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va. The commerce committee chairman wants the measure to go through the normal -- and longer -- legislative channels involving committee hearings and votes. ""Bliley has dug in his heels. And it doesn't sound like its negotiable,"" said a congressional aide. In any event, Murdoch's testimony Thursday could get a sympathetic reception from lawmakers anxious to jump-start competition after last year's big communications bill. Competition in the cable business suffered after big phone companies scaled back plans to offer cable TV. Meanwhile, cable rates jumped 8.2 percent in the 12 months ended in February -- vs. a 3 percent rise in consumer prices. ""There's no competing service that has functioned at a level to cause cable rates to decrease,"" said Mark Buse, an aide to Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican. Buse said McCain, who chairs the commerce committee, has met with Murdoch and ""believes there is an an awful lot of validity to what Mr. Murdoch is trying to achieve."" In a preview of Thursday's hearing, cable industry officials insist they face competition from the likes of satellite broadcasters, regional Baby Bell Ameritech Corp. and now Murdoch's Sky. ""Cable is facing some very real competition already,"" said Torie Clarke of the National Cable Television Association. ","RogerFillion"
"Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported brisk sales of minivans and pickup trucks for August, pushing total U.S. sales for the automaker up 9 percent on a daily selling basis to 186,306. The August total broke a company record for the month of 176,184 set in 1989. Sales of light trucks, including popular Ram pickups and four-door minivans were 127,870, a 16.7 percent jump that marked the 11th consecutive month of rising light truck sales. Domestically produced car sales came in weaker than some analysts had expected, falling 2 percent to 58,255 units. Chrysler's strong light truck sales were helped by incentives on some Jeep sport utility models. Grand Cherokee sales rose 42 percent; Cherokee was up 52 percent; and Wrangler sales shot up 59 percent. Total pickup sales were held back somewhat by low supplies of the Dakota, which is undergoing a model changeover. Dealers have a 35-day supply of the compact pickups -- about half of what the industry considers to be ideal. Chrysler executives said they did not expect significant volumes of the new Dakotas to be available until October. Steven Torok, executive director of sales and marketing operations, said Chrysler was not concerned about the slide in car sales. Total car sales were down 4 percent from August 1995, and off 24 percent from July. August is often a seasonally weaker month than July, Torok said. Also, declines in the Dodge Stratus and Neon were partly attributable to model-year changeovers. ""Frankly, we saw our cars starting to firm up as the month went on, and we think we'll have a pretty good month in September,"" said Torok, adding September car sales will likely surpass those of August. Torok said the No. 3 automaker was pleased with the breadth of its sales performance. ""What we see is a very even, consistent demand pattern,"" he said. ""Consumer sentiment seems to be not euphoric but consistent."" Although car sales were slightly weaker, PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward said Chrysler's total numbers were still respectable because it was up against a strong year-ago performance. Chrysler was the only one of the major automakers to report monthly sales on Tuesday. General Motors Corp. is scheduled to report sales Wednesday. Ward predicted it will post sales that are 4 percent to 5 percent below last year, with light trucks again offsetting weak car numbers. Also on Tuesday, Subaru of America, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, reported U.S. sales up 18 percent to 10,361. Volvo Cars of North America, a unit of AB Volvo had August sales of 7,349, down almost 1 percent. ","ToddNissen"
"Music companies are waiting for the world to rock to a new sound that will entice consumers back into record shops and drive up sluggish global sales, analysts said on Tuesday. Without new global best sellers and an economic upturn, few analysts expect the global market to bask in the double digit growth seen from 1984 to 1994 when queues eager for records such as pop group R.E.M.'s ""Monster"" stretched from music shops. Discounting among retailers, international piracy of cassettes and compact discs and an ageing population, whose first stop on the high street might well be a book shop rather than a record store, have all hit the more mature markets. Global sales of pre-recorded music reached $39.8 billion in 1996, a 5.5 percent growth in retail value over 1995. Four billion compact discs, cassettes and records -- four percent more than in 1995 -- were sold. But the rate of growth is slowing. In retail value, global growth was six percent in 1995 and a hefty 15 percent in 1994. The figures, compiled by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) which represents the world's record firms, confirm that growth in developing markets is surging. But more mature markets such as North America have been hit by static sales and falling prices. David Chermont, media analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that investors had become used to the lack of ""mind-blowing"" growth, however, in an industry which is made up of a mix of growth and cyclical markets that wax and wane with economic confidence. ""Double-digit growth is not sustainable even in the healthiest markets,"" he said. ""I feel quite comfortable."" Another analyst, who declined to be named, noted: ""The whole industry can explode if a new sound suddenly arrives on the scene that starts driving sales."" Meanwhile, the main engine of growth has shifted away from the mature, developed markets, the figures show. The IFPI said, ""In 1996 around 70 percent of the world's music growth was generated in less developed markets -- in particularly from Latin America and Asia."" ""This compares to only 20 percent in 1993, when global growth was at a similar level to 1996."" But the trade body brushed aside concerns that the industry was under serious threat by technology such as CD-ROMs, booming international piracy and because the babies borne during the rocking 1960s were now approaching middle age and no longer bought music. ""There is a huge potential in music,"" Nic Garnett, director general of IFPI, told a seminar during London Music Week, noting that the global market had surged from $27 billion to almost $40 billion in the last five years. ""This is very much a thriving, global business,"" he said. ""No market is that mature where the exciting process of new artists coming through cannot re-ignite (it),"" he added. But he called on governments to protect the intellectual property business with copyright laws that prevent ""pirates"" from copying and re-selling cassettes or compact discs at vastly cheaper prices. Piracy is one of the most serious crimes threatening the $35 billion U.S. recording industry and represents losses of over $2.0 billion every year, the IFPI said. The U.S., which together with Canada accounts for 31 percent of the global music market, saw growth fall to only two percent in value terms. The Canadian market fell by six percent. But Europe remains the world's largest region for music sales, accounting for 34 percent of the market. Britain, boosted by the popularity of groups such as the Spice Girls and Oasis, saw sales rise seven percent to $2.71 billion. But the Netherlands and Italy saw sales growth of only two percent, less than inflation. Germany and France clocked up eight and six percent respectively. Latin America was the fastest-growing region, with total sales up by almost 30 percent. With an upturn of the economy, Brazil showed a 33 percent rise in sales that catapulted it into the seat of the world's sixth latest market. In Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan saw over 20 percent sales growth while the Japanese market remained almost static at two percent. Australia was up by 14 percent. Five big music companies control about two thirds of the market -- PolyGram NV of the Netherlands, Japan's Sony Corp, Warner -- part of Time Warner Inc of the U.S. -- Germany's Bertelsmann AG, and EMI Group Plc of Britain.

"Chinese President Jiang Zemin, seeking to ensure his grip on power after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, called on the army on Tuesday to obey only the ruling Communist Party. The People's Liberation Army, whose backing Jiang needs to ensure political control, should toe the party line, Jiang told a meeting of army delegates to the National People's Congress, or parliament. ""On this vital political issue that concerns the future and destiny of the party, the state and the nation, there must not be the slightest ambiguity or vacillation,"" the official Xinhua news agency quoted Jiang as saying. Jiang, who also holds the posts of Communist Party chief and chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, never served in the armed forces and has tried hard to win army support to bolster his position as Deng's political heir. Deng died on February 19 aged 92. Jiang has since moved to cement his position as China's supreme ruler, urging the nation to rally around the party with him at its core. On Tuesday, Jiang called on army members of parliament to ""seek no fame, status and promotion (and) give priority to the party"", Xinhua said. ""Our army has always followed what the party says,"" he told the meeting, which was attended by generals Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wan'nian and Chi Haotian. All of them are vice-chairmen of the military commission while Chi also serves as defence minister. Jiang told his audience that the party's leadership had enabled military victories of the past and made the armed forces stronger. But he said the drive to modernise the three million strong army had created a range of problems and warned officers not to step outside the law while performing their duties. ""Cadres at various levels must run the army with strict discipline and according to law and do their routine ideological and managerial work in a meticulous way,"" he said. The army that ushered in nearly five decades of communist rule has benefited immensely from capitalist-style reforms launched by Deng in the late 1970s, running luxury hotels, factories and dealing in real estate. Told by Beijing to make money for itself to supplement its budget, the army has also been widely accused of smuggling and other official abuses of power in its drive to do so. China has set a defence budget of 80.6 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) this year, a rise of 12.7 percent over actual spending for 1996. Western military analysts say total defence spending is considerably higher than the published figures. Beijing defends its hefty increases in military spending by saying the base figure is still low and inflation has cut buying power. ","ScottHillis"
"China's ban on state banks trading on the state debt secondary market is making state debt issues more difficult but Beijing is expected to take measures to offset the impact, analysts said on Friday. The ban has made liquidity flow out of the markets, depressing prices and weakening investor confidence, making the response to this year's first issue much cooler than issues last year, they said. But Beijing has already signalled that it wants to encourage individuals to stay in the state debt market. The authorities announced this week that individuals would be allowed to open special state debt trading accounts for the first time. The service fee levied on trades by individuals was also cut to 0.2 percent from 0.3 percent. Beijing has been chosen as the test site for the personal accounts, but individuals in others parts of China will be allowed to open such accounts if the experiment succeeds. Analysts said they also expect Beijing to soon allow the establishment of state debt investment funds. ""Individual investors have responded more coolly to this year's first issue than to the last few issues,"" said one state debt analyst with a major Chinese brokerage. ""The ban is the major reason,"" he said. ""It has depressed state debt prices on the secondary markets. With sentiment hurt, investors have become more reluctant to buy."" ""State banks used to be major money suppliers on China's state debt market,"" said one trader. ""Their withdrawal is depressing the market and making state debt issues more difficult."" The first batch of 1997 state debt, the 20 billion yuan ($2.41 billion) two-year discount treasury note, is being issued from January 22 to February 17. But with China's financial markets basically all closed from this weekend until February 17 for the Chinese lunar new year holiday, the issue was basically completed by Friday afternoon. Some sales will also be made on the last day of issue. For the first time, the top five underwriters of the treasury note issue are all securities houses rather than state banks because the banks no longer need to build positions for secondary market trading, traders said. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, recently ordered commercial banks to withdraw from trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets. They are only allowed to offset existing positions and must not build new ones. China issued a record of 195.2 billion yuan in state debt last year and is expected to issue another record of 250 billion yuan this year, industry sources said. ""Despite the lukewarm response from retail investors, institutions have still shown great interest in the latest issue,"" said a broker with a major underwriter. ""They widely expect the central government to take market-boosting measures,"" he said. ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"When Deng Xiaoping took power in 1979 an urban Chinese needed a year's salary to buy a black and white television. When he died 18 years later, the average city dweller could afford a refrigerator, a washing machine and a colour television -- some could even buy their own home. Deng took over a China wracked by the 1966-76 decade of the radical Cultural Revolution and an economy stultified by three decades of Stalinist central planning. ""Let some people get rich first,"" Deng said in an axiom that underlined his rapid-fire approach to the economic reform that marked his rule. The goal of Deng's economic reforms, which he first tried and failed to implement in 1960s, reflected his more pragmatic policies after Mao's sweeping idealism. Both men wanted to keep the Communist Party in power but Deng believed that economic prosperity and money in the pockets of every Chinese would be a safer guarantee. ""Without a vision of his own to impose on society, Deng has been willing to adopt policies of non-intervention,"" wrote Barry Naughton in ""Deng Xiaoping: The Portrait of a Chinese Statesman"". He dared to sweep away rigid planning in favour of free market forces, allowed private business into the command economy and decided to open China's door to the rest of the world. In so doing, he saw the average per capita income of urban Chinese soar by 1,500 percent to about 5,600 ($674) in 1995 from 316 yuan ($38) a year in 1978. Earnings of rural residents leapt by more than 2,500 percent to 3,600 yuan ($433) a year in 1996 compared with just 116 yuan ($13) in 1978. On the world stage, its foreign trade has ballooned from an asterisk when Mao died in 1976 to 11th in the world and an engine of Asian growth in 1997. Deng's first attempt at reform from 1976 to 1978 was also the first in a series of boom-bust cycles, a recurrent fact of economic reform for years. The economy overheated and had to be reined in as Deng rushed to allow Chinese to get rich. But the tone was set. Deng and his day-to-day policy-makers wanted to revive the economy and they chose to do so by getting rid of over-bureacratisation and allowing greater autonomy. They started by introducing the responsibility system for farmers, under which China's 800 million peasants were allowed to sell on the free market any produce they grew over and above the quota for which they were ""responsible"" to the state. Agricultural output skyrocketed, farmers' incomes soared and rural enterprise was born. That success prompted Deng to introduce the ""factory manager responsibility system"" that freed managers from the control of the Communist Party secretary ubiquitous in every state unit. ""Whoever is given responsibility should be given authority as well,"" Deng said in 1978. He battled orthodox Marxist ideologues to legalise private enterprise. He set up experimental Special Economic Zones on the coast where foreign investment and capitalist practices were allowed to flourish -- and then to seep into the rest of China. He lifted decades of controls on prices of many items, a move that brought bursts of fierce inflation but also allowed the marketplace to take command and meant that goods filled shop shelves that had been left empty by decades of state planning. The ultimate goal was to force enterprises to take responsibility for their own profits and losses and sink or swim amid market competition. Many factories -- some state-owned, many collective and private -- responded to that challenge. However, many government enterprises have been unable to compete, forcing the state to maintain subsidies to lumbering loss-making national industries for fear mass unemployment could trigger civil unrest to destabilise Deng's fragile new system. About 70 percent of China's 100,000 state-owned enterprises operate in the red and state banks are burdened with enormous bad debts -- up to 30 percent of their portfolios -- because they must extend policy loans on orders from the government. Deng's economic policymakers have tinkered with the spectre of bankruptcy but have repeatedly pulled back from the brink of a solution that raises shades of capitalism. The existence of a quasi-private economy alongside the huge and still-dominant public sector has fostered dislocations such as profiteering, corruption and inflation. Introduction of macro-economic controls has been slow amid reluctance to let go entirely of state levers. Deng preferred to set in motion the big picture and to use his unparalleled political clout to push through economic policies rather than to get involved with the policy basics. When he did, he called on occasion for bolder and faster growth -- preferring what he called ""short-term pain"" to ensure long-term gain but resulting in sometimes harmful policies that had to be followed by periods of moderation. ""Deng was a politician, a manager and a generalist whose most successful role was as the political godfather of economic reform,"" Naughton wrote. ","JaneMacartney"
"China looks likely to slow the pace of reform in its financial markets, the late Deng Xiaoping's most startling experiment, as his successors make stability their top priority this year, analysts said on Sunday. China's leaders already have enough on their plates -- the return of Hong Kong from July 1, the ruling Communist Party's 15th Congress later in the year and task of consolidating their power in the aftermath of Deng's death last Wednesday. Bold and ambitious new reforms in the financial sector are unlikely to occur before these more pressing items are out of the way, but pressure to move ahead will build during the year, the analysts said. ""I think for the coming months up to the Party Congress, the intention will be to keep things tight,"" said one European banker. ""But once the congress is out of the way, they will want to speed it up again."" An analyst working with a Shanghai brokerage said the authorities could be expected to be cautious on issuing new regulations and initiating new changes in the foreseeable future, but added: ""The main policy will not change."" ""The development of the stock market will not change despite the news (of Deng's death),"" said one trader. ""But to maintain the stability of the market, the government will not announce any big changes in the immediate future."" The chance of a roll-back in the overall trend towards bigger, more sophisticated and regulated financial markets seems even more unlikely. China's stock, futures and capital markets sprang out of Deng's comment in the early 1990s that capitalist-style markets might be worth trying. ""If, after one or two years of experimentation, they prove feasible, we can expand them. Otherwise, we can put a stop to them and be done with it,"" Deng said. But as Deng probably guessed when he said it, once the markets' juggernaut got under way, it was probably impossible to do much more than guide it. ""The markets are still experimental to some extent, but closing them down is less and less of an option as time passes,"" the banker said. The Beijing leadership is faced with a host of pressing issues related to the financial markets. The markets are still waiting for the release of the long-delayed Securities Law, Futures Law and Investment Fund Law, all basic building blocks of the financial industry. Foreign bankers and insurers are impatient about the snail's pace at which China's financial sector is being opened up. The futures markets are so constrained by policy that they are scarcely able to fulfil their function -- the hedging of risk, traders say. Stock brokers complain about the bureaucratic way in which companies are chosen for listing, resulting in too many poor quality firms being listed too slowly. And the huge problem of heavily indebted state-owned enterprises is still there waiting to be resolved. ""The need is there, there is an enormous need to address the issues,"" the banker said. ""But the political situation has not been stable enough for people to attack the knotty decisions."" ""Stability is the top requirement for now. Any sign of weakness could trigger something unexpected,"" he added. ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"Office Depot stopped building superstores when it agreed to merge with Staples Inc and will have to scramble to regain its footing if it remains alone, industry analysts said on Friday. ""They need to circle the wagons and begin rebuilding management and decide what kind of company they want to be,"" said Mark Mandel of The Chicago Corp. ""They've lost lots of momentum.""   The deal to combine Staples and Office Depot, reached in September, would have created a dominant force in office-supply retailing with about 1,000 stores. Rival OfficeMax has between 700 and 800 superstores. But federal regulators earlier on Friday struck a blow that was potentially fatal to the transaction, saying such a combination would cripple price competition for office supplies in some markets. The companies denounced the decision by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Staples chief executive Thomas Stemberg told reporters Staples may challenge the FTC ruling in court.   ""Computer sales collapsed and paper prices were deflating but their margins held up,"" McMullin said. ""And the infrastructure's in place."" But McMullin said the rejection by the FTC and the prospect of a court battle were clouding Office Depot's outlook. Staples shares rose after the FTC ruling and closed at 21-7/8, or 5/8 higher. Office Depot shares dropped 6 to 13, after having fallen as low as 12, or roughly the price at which they were trading before the September merger announcement. ""Staples is up and Office Depot is down. If they were going to get together, you'd expect more harmony,"" McMullin said. ((-- Miami newsroom, 305-374-5013)) ","MichaelConnor"
"British regional electricity company (REC) Northern Electric Plc on Tuesday lost a bitter battle to stay independent, finally falling to a 782 million pound ($1.31 billion) bid from U.S. utility CalEnergy Co Inc. CalEnergy's CE Electric won control with a wafer-thin majority, gaining the support of 50.3 percent of the votes, a margin of just 300,000 shares. The bid was so closely fought that it ran over its original deadline and the outcome was uncertain right down to the wire. Insurer Prudential Corp stepped in at the eleventh hour to try to thwart CE's move by buying up nearly one million Northern shares from investors who had previously accepted CE's bid. ""We look forward to working with Northern Electric's management to put in place a smooth transition,"" CE Electric's chairman and chief executive David Sokol said in a statement. Northern said it would not make an immediate statement. ""We will give a recommendation to shareholders after Christmas,"" a Northern spokesman said. Last Friday's original bid deadline was extended to 1300 GMT on Tuesday after CE protested about share purchases by Northern's advisers Schroders and BZW and a 250,000 pound fee to BZW not disclosed until Friday. On Monday an appeal by Northern to reverse the deadline extension was rejected by the Takeover Panel, which polices mergers and acquisitions in the City of London. Analysts said the takeover battle would leave a number of questions to be answered over the role of advisers. The bid was the second hostile takeover that Northern had faced -- it spent 560 million pounds fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner. Northern, which was then the first privatised British power company to become a takeover target, initially received a billion pound bid from Trafalgar House at the end of 1994. But the offer was scuppered when electricity industry regulator Stephen Littlechild announced plans for more stringent price controls, sending electricity share prices tumbling. Northern's fall marks the tenth of the 12 cash-rich RECS privatised in 1990 to be taken over since they became available when the government's golden share expired in March 1995. It is also the fourth to be taken over by a U.S. company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London Electricity, respectively, currently under way. American companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining RECs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful springboard for expansion into Europe. Among potential bidders, analysts named Houston Industries, which failed in its attempt to secure control of Norweb with Central &amp; South West Corp in October 1995. Florida Power &amp; Light and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which have both been rumoured previously to be interested in RECS, are again being eyed as possible buyers. Entergy of the U.S. has just clinched an agreed 1.267 billion pound deal to take over London Electricity, which provides power to the capital and its financial heart, the City. The electricity companies have attracted harsh criticism from lobby groups and the British media over fat executive pay packets, shareholder payouts and spiralling takeover prices.

"Ivory Coast's cocoa mid-crop (May-Sept) could match harvest forecasts of over 150,000 tonnes but bean sizes are seen down from the record 1995/96 season (Oct-Sept), crop analysts and exporters said on Thursday. ""The development seems to be coming along quite nicely,"" said one. ""It is still early but I see no reason to suspect the mid-crop will be poor."" Good peak wet season rains in June would decide the final mid-crop tally but this year's bean sizes are not expected to match the mainly exportable grades (105 beans per 100 grammes) seen in the record 1.2 million tonnes (total crop) 1995/96 year. ""Last year's mid-crop (200,000 tonnes) was exceptional. I think the sizes will return to more normal levels,"" said another crop analyst, pointing to a range of 110-120 range with lowest grades possibly touching 150. Ivory Coast's main crop reached around one million tonnes by the season's closing date of April 27. Crop analysts expect the mid-crop to be down on 1995/96 with some early forecasts in a 160-180,000 tonnes range. Crop analysts said said plantation soil moiture levels had dropped in some areas after heavy wet season rains in April eased off in the first ten days of May. ""There was less moisture than I thought there would be, but it is not a problem,"" said one. Bean sizes would swell if June rains were sufficient. ""I do not have a pessimistic view of mid-crop,"" said the analyst. ""As far as I am concerned soil humidity is average but our teams have not yet completed their tour."" Crop analysts returning from upcountry farm inspections reported little harvesting and drying of cocoa. They did not expect mid-crop arrivals at port to strenghten until June -- after a lull in activity between the main and mid-crops. ""What is there will sit around for mixing in with better beans and larger quantities. It is just not worth the farmers selling yet,"" said one. Exporters say late main crop and a trickle of mid-crop beans arriving at ports are in a 105-110 range. ""Last year, even the tail of the mid-crop met export standards,"" said one. Special contracts for grades outside the official export standard would still be exported. ""Discounts will be applied, as for poor coffee beans, but it will all be exported,"" he added. Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa crop by the year 2,000, partly to remove poorer grades from export markets, but also to push up world prices while adding export value. Local processors, with three factories, have a total bean processing capacity of around 160,000 tonnes. That figure could rise to at least 209,000 tonnes in 1996/97 as local factories build extensions and possible oil-palm factory capacity for cocoa bean processing comes on line. Other factories already under construction or in final planning stages could take Ivorian bean processing capacity to over 350,000 tonnes by 1998/99 (Corrects from 1997/98) -- without taking into account a raft of plans in early discussion stages. -- Abidjan newsroom, + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"China announced on Tuesday a preferential tax rate of 15 percent for foreign banks doing local yuan business but limited them to dealing with foreign-funded firms registered in Shanghai. Foreign bankers expressed surprise at the rate, which is the same as that at which their foreign currency business is taxed, and much lower than the 33 percent rate for Chinese banks doing the same business with the same clients. But bankers with local Chinese commercial banks said they were not worried about the decision, saying the scope of the local currency business that foreign banks would be allowed to conduct would be highly restrictive for years to come. The official Xinhua news agency said in a report that the four foreign banks chosen by the People's Bank of China to do local currency deposit and loan business would be taxed at the same rate as their current foreign currency business. ""Their (foreign banks) income tax rate will remain the same, 15 percent as before,"" the agency said. ""Their clients can only be foreign-funded enterprises registered in the city, and they should open RMB (renminbi or yuan) accounts in the central bank's Shanghai branch,"" it added. The four foreign banks are the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp, Citibank, Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan. ""It sounds too good to be true,"" said a banker with one of the four foreign banks chosen to begin yuan business. ""It's especially strange because many foreign bankers have at least implied that they would be willing to accept a higher tax rate. It's very surprising."" A second foreign banker said the major restriction on the foreign banks would be local currency funding, especially given the ban on the banks taking on individual retail deposits in yuan. ""The key issue seems to be funding,"" he said. ""If the funding sources are limited you have no local currency to expand your business."" All foreign banks in China are currently restricted to doing business in foreign currency and have been eager to gain a share of the huge local market for yuan deposits and loans. ""The announced tax is not going to greatly impact on our business in the short term,"" said an official with a major Chinese bank. ""Foreign banks are now restricted in the companies and location of their local currency business and further development is expected to be very slow."" But another local banker said the opening of yuan business to foreign banks would inevitably put pressure on Chinese banks. ""In the past, competition has been only among ourselves and no matter whether our services are good or bad, we survive at the expense of depositors,"" the banker said. ""In the long run, we have to improve ourselves."" Xinhua said that about 10 foreign banks had applied to the central People's Bank of China for the right to start yuan business. According to rules issued by the central bank, foreign banks can only accept yuan deposits from foreign-funded firms or from foreign individuals or deposits from Chinese enterprises derived from the banks' loans to them. The banks can supply yuan loans only to foreign-funded firms or Chinese enterprises who have previously obtained foreign currency loans from the banks, the rules said. ","GrahamEarnshaw"
"Canada's Philip Environmental Inc. said on Thursday it planned to acquire Houston-based Allwaste Inc. and Serv-Tech Inc. in two deals worth $612 million that would create North America's biggest recycling firm. ""We are naturally very, very excited about this opportunity,"" Philip Chief Executive Allen Fracassi told a media conference call. ""It makes great economic sense and the synergies are just spectacular."" Hamilton, Ontario-based Philip said that the deals when completed in June would create North America's largest metals recycling and industrial services company, with annual revenues topping $1.6 billion, 8,000 employees and 215 operating locations in North America, Europe and South America. Philip, which has recently made a spate of acquisitions to expand beyond the metals recycling business, said it would swap 0.611 of a Philip share for each Allwaste share for total consideration of $540 million. The deal included the assumption of about $133 million in debt from Allwaste, which provides industrial services. In a separate transaction, Philip agreed to exchange 0.403 of a Philip share for each Serv-Tech share in a deal valued at $72 million, including the assumption of $21 million of debt. Industrial and environmental services firm Serv-Tech generated more than $140 million in revenues in 1996 and Philip said that its earnings would be boosted by the Serv-Tech deal. Fracassi told reporters that Philip was not done with acquisitions. ""Our acquisition program will continue. We are in an very very quickly consolidating, fairly new industrial sector, so we'll continue to seek and react to opportunities,"" he said. Analyst Peter von Ond at Canadian brokerage Midland Walwyn called the deals a good fit. Von Ond said he revised his 1998 earnings estimate for Philip to C$1.70 ($1.25) a share from C$1.60 ($1.17) after the news. His 1997 forecast was unchanged at C$1.40 ($1.03) a share since the deals do not close until late June and more Philips shares will be issued, offsetting earnings growth. Philip earned C71 cents (52 cents) a share in 1996. Shares of Philip were down C50 cents to C$22 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday and by 25 cents to $16.125 in New York. AllWaste rose $2.50 to $9.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Serv-Tech rose 81.25 cents to $5.875 on Nasdaq. ","LydiaZajc"
"GTE Corp, the one big local telephone company already able to offer long distance across much of the United States is being courted for alliances and mergers, but seems relatively self sufficient. Analysts who attended a meeting with the company on Friday came away impressed by the list of suitors. ""They said they have been in merger and alliance talks with everyone from AT&amp;T (Corp) to WorldCom (Inc), but they didn't give the impression that talks had gone very far,"" said Barry Sine of brokers SBC Warburg.  Analysts were even more impressed by how well GTE expects it can do on its own and by the freedom from management distractions that such self-sufficiency offers. GTE forecast that earnings per share in 1997 and beyond would rise 10 percent a year or more, including a 1997 infusion of a third to half a billion dollars of long distance revenues. Telephone revenues in the U.S., where growth in customer lines has often been the best in the industry, were expected to grow 5-6 percent in 1997. GTE shares took a cue from the presentation, rising $0.50 on Friday and a further $3/8 to $44-5/8 by midday on Monday.   ""GTE made a very strong case that they don't need to merge with anyone,"" Sine said. GTE's local calling operations are like a shotgun blast on a map of the United States, peppering 28 states, but on average only accounting for 10 percent of lines in those states. Regional Bells by contrast blanket regions, which led to them being ruled dominant carriers under the terms of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, while GTE was not.   So while regional Bells and long distance companies wrangle over the terms of competitive access to local customers, which must be agreed before regional Bells can enter the long distance market, GTE has already been operating long distance services since the spring. ""I think GTE is in a very good strategic position,"" said Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. By the end of the third quarter GTE had won over 500,000 customers from other carriers. By the end of 1996 it forecasts that it will have 750,000 and by end-1997 1.5 million.   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, GTE said it would increase long distance revenues seven-fold in 1997 from 1996. It gave no exact figure. GTE's fixed and wireless networks cover areas in which a third of the U.S. population live, but with an extension of 100 miles in each direction, would reach two thirds. Not only does this give network advantages, with few places far from a call switching center, but it means the GTE brand name is recognised very widely across the country.   Analysts say brand name recognition is vital for companies that intend to bundle Internet and wireless with local and long distance calling. GTE has plenty to offer a partner. Its mainly rural and suburban customers are the hardest to reach by other means, putting a premium on its network. GTE's international operations, including investments in Venzuela, Argentina and the Dominican Republic, and a planned push into Brazil. Latin America is one of the hottest areas for telecom market growth in the world. GTE had its most serious merger talks with MCI Communications Corp analysts say. MCI was making the moves, but was disappointed that GTE was not prepared to offer more than $30 per share, according to news reports. Neither company has ever confirmed the talks nor the price. MCI eventually turned its merger attention to British Telecommunications Plc, which already had a 20 percent stake in MCI. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610 ","NickLouth"
"Czechs, with a relatively large number of Oscar-winning films and filmmakers for a small nation, on Tuesday praised Jan and Zdenek Sverak for bringing home a coveted Academy Award for their film ""Kolya"". The story of an ageing bachelor's re-awakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 Velvet Revolution won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in the ceremony held late on Monday. President Vaclav Havel, a former dissident playwright under communism who acted in a few films himself, sent a victory telegram to the family Sverak in Los Angeles. ""I am pleased with the great success of your film. I am happy that after many years a Czech film has again received the Oscar,"" Havel's press office quoted the telegram as saying. Local newscasts headlined the Kolya win for the director Jan, 31, and his scriptwriter father Zdenek, who played the greybeard bachelor in Kolya. ""The Oscar Goes to Prague"" heralded the capital city's daily Vecernik Praha. It was the first Czech foreign language film Oscar since Jiri Menzel's ""Closely Observed Trains"" won in 1968 amid the period known worldwide as the ""Czech New Wave"". Slovak Elmar Klos won the best foreign film Oscar in 1966 for ""The Shop on Main Street"" when Czechoslovakia was still ruled as one state. This country of 10 million people also lays claim to director Milos Forman, a Prague native who made the Oscar-winning ""Amadeus"" (1985) and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1976) after emigrating to the United States. Forman failed to pick up best director honours on Monday after his nomination for ""The People Versus Larry Flint"", after winning a Golden Globe and the Berlin's Golden Bear for the film. The Sverak team made their first international splash in 1992, when the post-war drama-comedy ""Elementary School"" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost. Zdenek is currently working on the team's first original English-language script. Critics say Kolya, a politically-charged comedy/drama which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech New Wave. ""The film is about how the understanding between nations is much more important than the power,"" Sverak told reporters backstage after winning the Oscar. Earlier this month Kolya won the Czech version of the Oscar, the Czech Lev (Lion), for best picture, but Zdenek Sverak was edged out for the best Czech actor award by Bolek Polivka, a popular cabaret comedian. Kolya was favoured to take home the Oscar after winning Hollywood's Golden Globe for best foreign language film in January. ","JohnMastrini"
"Undeterred by recent market worries over the networking sector, Cisco Systems Inc chief executive John Chambers said he continued to see the industry's overall business growing at a brisk clip in 1997. ""We see a very good market at 30 to 50 percent growth for the forseeable future,"" Chambers told Reuters in an interview after a conference call with analysts in which he repeated Cisco's goal of outperforming the market's growth. Cisco's second quarter results narrowly beat Wall Street estimates, rebuffing market talk on Tuesday of a shortfall. Cisco reported that net income rose nearly 62 percent to $339.5 million in its second quarter to January 25 compared with $209.7 million a year earlier. Net sales rose 73 percent to $1.59 billion from $918.5 million a year earlier. Analysts said Cisco's pro forma net income of $351.9 million, or $0.51 a share, excluding an acquisition-related writeoff and a net gain from sale of an investment, topped First Call's mean analysts estimate of $0.50 a share and roughly equalled Wall Street's $0.51-$0.52 ""whisper number."" Chambers said the firm expected to acquire another 10 to 12 companies in its current year. ""Almost every market segment has opportunity for internal products, joint development projects with our partners and acquisitions,"" he told Reuters. Cisco shares, which had ended the Nasdaq market session down 1-1/8 at 67-1/8 before the results were released, slid as low as 64-1/4 in after-market trade. Some analysts attributed the decline to concerns the company's post-exceptional $0.49 a share earnings number had fallen short of expectations. Analysts said Cisco executives in their conference call had addressed concerns over a possible slowing in the market, sparked by comments attributed to rival 3Com Corp. Several analysts said they saw no sign that any December sluggishness observed by 3Com had a major impact on Cisco's business. ""I think it was another good solid quarter from Cisco. No hint of any problems,"" said Paul Saunders of Van Kasper &amp; Co. Chambers said a shortening of order lead times -- down to one to three weeks now from eight to 12 weeks previously -- meant quarterly shifts in results may be more pronounced. He repeated previous comments that ""sometime in the future, we'll see a quarter that is in single-digit growth."" Analysts said sequential growth in revenues from one quarter to the next -- such as the second quarter's more than 10 percent rise from the first fiscal quarter -- would still provide sharp year-on-year increases. A second quarter gross margin of 65.3 percent surprised some analysts who had been expecting price competition to cut into margins. But Chambers said: ""Our overall guidance is over time...margins will continue to go down."" ""There will be a few (quarters) up, but I think most of them will be down, hopefully just slightly."" Smith Barney analyst Therese Murphy noted Cisco's third quarter tended to be weak, but saw no reason to be ""any more cautious than we normally would be in the April quarter."" Chambers did not see any fundamental industry change, and continued to target growth above the industry rate while taking advantage of further consolidation, she said. ","SamuelPerry"
"British supermarket group J. Sainsbury aims to regain the lead position it lost to Tesco by emphasising traditional strengths of choice, quality and value, deputy chief executive Dino Adriano said. ""The aim will be to have got (the supermarket business) back to its rightful position,"" Adriano, who is set to take over running the group's supermarket operation next year, said. ""The emphasis is very much -- going forward -- going to be on our traditional strengths of...choice, quality and therefore better value,"" he said in an interview. Sainsbury was toppled from its pre-eminent position among British supermarkets last year as the launch of a loyalty card helped boost arch-rival Tesco's sales. Sainsbury turned in its first drop in profits for 22 years in May, with pre-tax profits for the year ending March 9 touching 764 million pounds ($1.19 billion) from 808 million pounds previously. It has undertaken a comprehensive strategy review and Adriano admitted the group had failed to communicate its message to customers. ""We are sorry we have not actually shouted louder about it in the past,"" he said. In June, Sainsbury bowed reluctantly to pressure from Tesco's success and launched its own loyalty card. Adriano said sales had seen a two to three percent uplift from the Reward card, covering its costs, although assessments were approximate at this early stage. ""It's having the necessary impact at this point,"" he said. He said Reward was an important factor in future strategy. ""We have always had strong customer loyalty at Sainsbury and we are now seeking to reward that and build on it,"" Adriano said. Sainsbury said it had around six million customers signed up to Reward with around 4.75 million using it regularly. Adriano said the retail environment remained very competitive and that Sainsbury would try not to be beaten on price for key items. But he added that the group felt its offer of choice and quality could not always mean lowest prices. ""We do not feel it is possible to offer great quality and at very low prices,"" he said. ""Quality improved, price maintained will be one of our strap lines"" particularly for own-brand product, he said. He said own-brand goods were very important and would be ""an area of great innovation and development...in years to come."" Own-brand goods traditionally give retailers a better margin than branded products. Adriano said petrol retailing remained very tough for supermarkets as a result of price wars triggered by oil major Esso's launch of its PriceWatch campaign earlier this year. ""Most (supermarkets) are into petrol stations and no one's making any money on this at present,"" he said. He said some companies were losing money but added that ""hopefully, the situation will stabilise before long."" Adriano added that the group would be looking to increase square footage, both through new stores and refurbishments of existing premises. ""In retailing, the key thing is adding new square footage,"" he said, adding that there was still scope to develop sales per square foot in much of the chain. Sainsbury is also eyeing expansion overseas, particularly in the U.S., Adriano said, and would be happy to clinch a deal currently under discussion to acquire 12 stores there from Royal Ahold of the Netherlands. Industry sources suggest a $50 million price tag for the stores if the deal is secured. Adriano said the size of the U.S. market meant that ""the opportunity for getting a formula right and then rolling it out...is quite significant."" ($1=.6412 Pound) ","JoWinterbottom"
"British Telecommunications will start talks with European regulators within the next week about its planned $20 billion merger with America's MCI after the deal was overwhelmingly backed by investors on Tuesday. MCI shareholders approved the ambitious deal two weeks ago, leaving regulatory clearance the last hurdle to the creation of Concert Plc -- a ""global supercarrier"" with annual revenues of more than 25 billion pounds ($40.5 billion) and 43 million customers. A BT spokesman said the company remained confident of winning a green light from both the European Commission, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice by autumn. But he could not confirm speculation that Brussels might demand two minor concessions which include modifications to the two groups' dominant position in audio and video conferencing and guarantees that competition can have reasonable access to Concert's transatlantic facilities. The EC is due to report by June 11 on BT's plans to buy the 80 percent it does not already own of MCI Communications Corp, the aggressive, U.S. long-distance operator that has become the second, long-distance carrier in the U.S. behind phone giant AT &amp; T Corp. Ahead of expected regulatory approval, a resounding 98.5 percent of BT's 2.3 million shareholders backed the merger, sweeping aside concerns raised by some analysts that a 30 percent premium which BT is paying is a high price for control. The deal creates the world's fourth largest telecoms group in terms of sales after Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT), America's AT&amp;T and Germany's Deutsche Telekom. ""I have reservations about the merger,"" said pensioner Stella Garton-Brown, who has been a small shareholder in BT since the company was privatised in 1984. ""I'm not always sure that bigger is best."" But powerful financial institutions, that own about 73 percent of BT, tend traditionally to back company boards. Some analysts put down a surge in BT's share price during key transatlantic roadshows over the last weeks to proof of support for what will be the biggest transatlantic deal in history. Others put the share price down to index-linked buying. Sir Iain Vallance, the chairman of BT and co-chairman designate of Concert, told shareholders that because of the development of new technology and the globalisation of the booming $650 billion telecoms market, the merger would bring benefits that BT could not deliver alone. Concert combined the feistiness of the younger, fast-growing MCI with the stability of BT -- ""the world's best market defender coupled with the world's best market attacker"", he said. BT and MCI currently hold about six percent of the global telecoms market, which is expected to top one trillion dollars by 2000. But Vallance said: ""We want to go after the other 94 percent."" Concert wants to provide clients around the globe with local, long distance, international and mobile phone services as well as multi-media, Internet-based services and systems integration for business clients. The group plans to be represented in key countries across the world so it can focus on winning high-margin, multinational clients that analysts estimate account for about 15-20 percent of global telecoms revenue. A deal with MCI also opens up the world's largest telecoms market to BT -- the United States is home to 40 percent of the largest multinational company headquarters. BT also hopes to take a share of the lucrative local market through MCI as this is opened up to competition. MCI shareholders will receive 5.4 Concert shares for each MCI share and $6.0 cash. BT shareholders get a 2.2 billion pound special dividend and total dividend for this year of 19.85p. BT has promised that the merger, after an initial five percent earnings dilution, will yield savings from combining overlapping services of 1.5 billion pounds over the first five years and 500 million pounds pre-tax annually after that. But merchant banks such as Robert Fleming are sceptical about company forecasts of a six percent annual dividend rise as increasing competition is set to dampen healthy call volumes and drive down prices nearer to the relatively marginal cost of delivering them. Fleming says BT's gearing level might surge to 150 percent in the next three years and has downgraded its recommendation on BT to ""sell"" because it says the group's valuation looks stretched against other European telecom groups. The merchant bank's gearing calculation includes a 1-1.2 billion pound windfall tax if Britain's opposition Labour Party wins the May 1 election and an approximate 1.6 billion pound acquisition of the remaining 40 percent of BT's mobile phone business Cellnet. It also includes other investments in Europe and key Asia Pacific markets, where Concert has yet to build a large presence. ($= 0.616 British Pounds) ","KirstinRidley"
"It began with a whimper, culminated in an economic explosion and was one of the most far-reaching events of the 20th century. Deng Xiaoping's 1992 move to kick-start an economy faltering after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre strengthened his conservative opponents was a high point of his career and launched an economic boom that has reverberated around the world. In January 1992, Deng, then 87, toured the boomtown of Shenzhen that borders Hong Kong in what has gone down in history as his ""nan xun"" or Southern Tour. For more than two months not a newspaper in China's Communist Party controlled media machine published even a word of Deng's unprecedented visit, underlining the extent to which China's paramount leader -- by then retired from all formal posts -- had lost control of the powerful propaganda apparatus. Hardline leftists who opposed Deng's bid to place his stamp of approval on the flourishing Shenzhen Special Economic Zone that was his brainchild blocked for weeks any news of his tour. But in late March of that year, Deng and his loyalists succeeded in pushing aside the propaganda tsars and his ""Southern Tour"" burst upon the Chinese public through primetime state television and splashed across whole pages of state-run newspapers. It marked the start of a new era in the reform process that Deng had launched in 1979. That southern tour unsheathed a double-edged sword of rising incomes and galloping inflation but many Chinese said on Saturday they were much better off than in the pre-Deng era. ""Mao made the Chinese stand up but Deng made us rich,"" said Yang Baisong, a 41-year-old taxi driver in Beijing. ""I can make 8-9,000 yuan ($960-$1,080) a month,"" Yang said. ""That's pretty good and this car is my own."" China's economy is the fastest growing on earth, sizzling at 9.7 percent last year after three years of double-digit growth. Deng, always impatient with economic reform, had acted out of deep frustration with the slow pace of economic change after hardliners regained the offensive in the wake of the bloody crackdown on student-led pro-democracy dissent in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Opposition to reform had come from top level bureaucrats, Marxist purists and Deng's own gerontocratic peers whose power and privilege stemmed from four decades of central planning. The media barrage of March 1992 marked a strategic turning point in Deng's campaign to outflank conservative opponents in the capital. At the same time, it exposed his own weakness in that he had to head south to areas where reform had found their strongest hold to push his agenda because he was unable to win a hearing in the bastion of conservativism in Beijing. The Southern Tour marked an unprecedented interference in the political process and revealed China's worst-kept secret -- that he was the man really running the country. It was Deng's first public appearance in more than a year -- he had deliberately faded from the scene to boost the stature and credibility of his chosen heir, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin who was appointed after the Tiananmen Square crackdown. In scarcely-veiled criticisms in Shenzhen, Deng revealed the extent of his disappointment with his anointed successor and with Premier Li Peng -- both too weak or too conservative to press the radical economic change that Deng believed was the only way to ensure the party retained power. ""We should be even bolder than before in conducting reform and opening to the outside and have the courage to experiment,"" he said in Shenzhen. ""We must not act like women with bound feet,"" he said. ","JaneMacartney"
"A 90-cent increase in the U.S. minimum wage will have little short-term impact on most fast food restaurants, since the competition for workers is keeping pay rates above the federally mandated standard. ""The (real) 'minimum wage' is what the closest McDonald's pays or it could be the local Pizza Hut,"" George Goulson, senior vice president of A&amp;W Restaurants Inc, said. But longer term, the industry fears that workers, who are already making more than the new minimum wage, will be looking for a raise to maintain the pay premium.   Earlier Tuesday, President Clinton signed into law the first rise in the minimum wage in five years, boosting the wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25. ""Our average crew wage is about $5.20 (an hour) so short-term there is not going to be any impact,"" said Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International Inc, which operates 4,307 restaurants in the United States. But higher minimum wages will raise total wages by about $500,000 over the next 12 months at American Restaurant Partners L.P., which operates 62 Pizza Hut restaurant franchises.   ""If you raise someone who started in the last two months (to the new minimum wage level), you also have to raise everybody else,"" said Terry Freund, chief financial officer of American Restaurant Partners. Beyond the minimum wage requirements, competition for workers, from cooks to delivery drivers, has forced many fast-food chains to pay up to hire good help, particularly in metropolitan markets. That competition is being driven by an increase in restaurant openings. ""There are neighborhoods where we have to pay $6.00 an hour to $6.50 or $7.00 to get"" good workers, Lynch added.   Fast-food industry executives said there has been competition for workers since the late 1980s, although the increase in restaurant openings is making the search for employees more intense. Another problem for quick-service restaurants is that wage competition from other employers often lures experienced workers away. A fast-food worker, for example, may be able to bring home more pay as a waiter or waitress at a casual dining establishment where they could receive $50 or $60 a night in tips, executives said. ""For QSRs (quick service restaurants)...it's even tougher to keep the kids,"" Roger Lipton, president of Lipton Financial Services, said. Reuters Chicago Newsdesk  312-408-8787 ","PatriciaCommins"
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Tuesday it supports plans for a single air traffic control centre to cover all airports in the fast growing Pearl River delta region in southern China. IATA director general Pierre Jeanniot told the Hong Kong International Aerospace Forum that all three existing air traffic service providers in Hong Kong, China and Macau had indicated acceptance of the concept after a recent meeting in Guangzhou. Jeanniot told Reuters after his speech that all airlines would benefit from a unified air traffic control through lower costs, faster transit times for overflights and reduced pilot workload. However he could give no timescale for when the concept might be introduced, where an overall centre would be based or how much it would cost. ""Three air traffic control centres can be very inefficient and potentially dangerous. It is at a busy cross roads and it is important that local capacity is coordinated.

"Mounting concerns about the loss of both two top executives and an equity stake in terrestrial digital TV sent shares in pay-television giant BSkyB diving further on Monday and analysts forecasts more weakness to come. Around 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) has been wiped off the value of British Sky Broadcasting since last week and some analysts said the shares, which fell 14.5p to 483p in afternoon trade, could tumble to 350p. News Corp Ltd is the largest shareholder in BSkyB. ""There has quite clearly been a re-rating in the last week and I think it's going to continue,"" said Jason Crisp, media analyst at brokers SocGen. Another broker said only in ""wildly optimistic"" cases could the shares be valued even at 450p. Negative weekend newspaper reports helped compound last week's share falls sparked by a report in the Financial Times that BSkyB could be shut out of the bidding for new digital TV licences, experts said. The Financial Times reported last week the television watchdog, the Independent Television Commission, had told BSkyB it should drop its one-third stake in a consortium with commercial TV groups Carlton Communications and Granada Group. BSkyB was enjoying an effective monopoly on pay- television and the watchdog was concerned about market domination, the FT said. The report, which remains unconfirmed, followed last week's announcement that BSkyB's respected chief executive Sam Chisolm was stepping down and deputy managing director David Chance was becoming a consultant. SocGen's Crisp said the stock, which had hit an intraday 1997 high of 669p on February 14, had been vastly over-rated and should be trading nearer 400p. He noted apart from the possible loss of its equity stake in its digital terrestrial TV consortium, called British Digital Broadcasting, and the loss of two very talented and experienced staff, flat satellite dish sales and rising operating costs were hitting the shares. ""All these things make you think it should be on a more typical PE (price earnings ratio) multiple of other big media companies,"" he added. At 400p, the stock would have a more reasonable PE of 22 times next year, compared to one nearer 30 times before the share correction, Tysoe said. Credit Suisse First Boston was even more negative. ""We'd just re-iterate from our call last week that fundamental value on BSkyB is about 450p even in wildly optimistic cases, about 350-400p in more reasoned scenarios,"" it stated in a note. But Mike Woodcock, media analyst at Nikko, said the share price fall had been overdone and he would recommend buying the shares under five pounds. He said that in the short-term, the news on BDB, a business he valued at around 400 million pounds, was positive from a financial point of view. Compensation is tipped by the Financial Times at 75 million pounds. BSkyB can also keep some 100 million pounds which it was going to invest in the joint venture. ""Is the news of BDB and Sam Chisolm stepping down enough to warrant 1.7 billion pounds being wiped from the value of BSkyB? I would say no,"" Woodcock said. ""The real benefits for BSkyB are in the provision of programming rather than in the equity stake."" But he said as traditionally high operating margins were squeezed -- partly because payments to show English Premier League soccer are set to rise to 160 million pounds per year from August -- he was expecting flat pre-tax profits of 309 million pounds in 1998 and 1997. Other longer-term concerns, he said, were about how independent BSkyB was from media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, its leading shareholder -- and how much News Corp would benefit from the success of the pay-television giant. The ITC hopes to decide by the end of this month on whether to award digital terrestrial television licences to BDB or a rival consortium run by cable and broadcast group NTL Inc. ","KirstinRidley"
"The glory of controlling Busang, one of the world's richest gold deposits, has thrown together an unlikely duo. In one corner is Peter Munk, the suave but aggressive founder of heavyweight Barrick Gold Corp., backed by buckets of money, power, connections and experience. In the other is David Walsh, the maverick chief of Bre-X Minerals Ltd., the young Canadian exploration firm that discovered Busang in the jungles of East Kalimantan on the Indonesian island of Borneo. The Indonesian government has told Barrick and Bre-X to form a joint venture to manage the fabulous gold find. But the government edict would force an unnatural David-and-Goliath alliance on two companies led by two very different men. To observers, Munk, 69, is the epitome of class. He makes sure everything is top-notch and pays top dollar. Barrick's imposing office towers over downtown Toronto, impressing visitors with its grandiosity. Those who know him best say Munk plays to win. In sports, he sticks to skiing and tennis, believing that focusing on just two activities will help him excel. With Barrick, North America's biggest gold company and Munk's baby, he sticks doggedly to gold, refusing to diversify into other metals or minerals. ""He's like a tiger,"" his long-time friend Bob Smith, the recently retired president of Barrick, told Reuters. ""If he grabs hold of something, he won't let go. He has a tremendous ability to focus, whether it's recreation or business."" In the 1950s, Munk, originally from Hungary, started up Clairtone Sound Corp., a stereo company that dazzled Canada until it flopped in 1971. ""Everything I've done afterward has been child's play compared with Clairtone,"" he told author Peter Newman. ""What I learned was never to give away your destiny."" In 1983, Munk started Barrick, producing 3,000 ounces a year, and built it into the world's third largest gold company with estimated production of 3.2 million ounces for 1996. Bre-X's Walsh has gone from rags to riches in less than four years. He started as a Montreal stockbroker, was transferred to Calgary, Alberta in the 1980s and then broke out on his own. He concentrated on oil and gas exploration and then switched to mining. But by 1993, his exploration efforts had dried up. ""We had these claims which were worthless, and no money,"" Walsh, 51, told Reuters in a recent interview. Almost broke, he scraped together C$10,000 ($7,400) to start exploring in Indonesia, pursuading friends to invest C$200,000 ($148,000) for a stake in the area now known as the central Busang. Walsh hit the jackpot with Busang, which has at least 57 million ounces of gold, currently worth $20 billion. ""It just kept growing,"" Walsh said. ""By July and August (1995) it really appeared it would be a monster discovery."" He ran Bre-X from the basement of his Calgary home until last year. Bre-X's rocketing stock has made him a multi-millionaire and he now lives in the Bahamas with his wife Jeannette. But he has one regret. ""We should have been more visible in Indonesia,"" he said. ""I think where we lacked was in making more relationships than we had in Indonesia."" Bre-X has an alliance with Sigit Harjojudan, the son of Indonesian President Suharto, but observers said Sigit's influence was eclipsed by that of his sister Siti Hardiyanti, with whom Barrick forged an early alliance. Munk has attracted to his advisory board former U.S. President George Bush, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and former Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl. He has ties with politicians in many countries and analysts said those gave him the upper hand with Busang. Munk and Walsh have tried to tango before. In 1994, they reached an agreement on developing Busang. But last-minute changes from Barrick prompted Bre-X to back out of the deal. With Barrick's rival Placer Dome Inc. trying to woo the Indonesian government into allowing it to bid on Bre-X, Walsh has made it clear he would rather do business with Placer than with Barrick.

"Canada's political leaders, campaigning for re-election on June 2, are accusing one another of being too American in their approach to Canada's cherished but malnourished health care system. Canada's universal medicare plan has suffered injury after injury in recent years as governments at the federal and provincial levels have taken a hatchet to health care spending in an effort to rein in galloping deficits. While all Canada's main political parties are pledging to reinvest in health if successful on June 2, the sensitive issue has become a political game of numbers and name calling. The ruling Liberals as well as the Conservative and Reform parties want to cut health care and are ""pushing Canada ever closer to an American-style two-tiered system,"" Alexa McDonough, leader of the left-leaning New Democrats, charged. ""Look past the rhetoric and look at the numbers,"" she said, adding that only her party would sustain federal support for medicare. Government-funded universal health care is a sacred cow in Canada and a key way for Canadians to distinguish themselves from their powerful American neighbours. Polls show that preservation of health care is a major election concern. But even as U.S. politicians have weighed adopting elements of Canadian health care in the past few years, Canada has moved further away from its traditional universal approach, adopting elements of the U.S. setup, the New Democrats say. The Liberals have cut health and education spending to C$12.5 billion ($9.1 billion), down about C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) from 1993, when they first took office under Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Critics say the cuts have shortened hospital stays, led to hospital closures and forced many Canadians to pay for their own home care -- shifting the system toward a U.S.-style one in which only the poor and the elderly receive care paid for by the government. But the Liberals claim to have defended the principles of universal medicare by preventing doctors and hospitals from charging extra for their services and prohibiting private health care clinics. ""All Canadians should have equal access to high-quality care,"" Anne McLellan, a Liberal candidate and Cabinet minister, said on Tuesday at a news conference. ""We will never accept one system for the very wealthy and another for the rest of us."" The day after Chretien called the June election, his government announced it would reverse C$4.8 billion ($3.5 billion) in planned cuts in transfers to the provinces for health and social spending over the next five years.

"A commuter plane heading for Detroit in a heavy snowstorm crashed in a remote wooded area south of the city on Thursday, killing all 30 on board, officials said. The Embraer-120, operated as flight 3272 by Comair, a regional carrier based in Cincinnati, crashed at 3:50 p.m. EST (2050 GMT) near the town of Ida about 25 miles (40 km) from Detroit near the Raisin River. Comair operates as a feeder for Delta Airlines. A nearby resident, Thomas Marino, said he heard the plane flying low overhead while shoveling snow off his driveway. ""I heard a jet flying very low. Then a loud boom, a vibration. I didn't see the fireball,"" he told Reuters. ""It sounded low, but planes fly low all the time over here, especially when it's overcast."" Much of the region had been hit by a storm which dumped a half foot (15 cm) or more of snow. There was no confirmation, however, that weather played a role in the crash. Marino said he drove one-half mile (0.8 km) to the crash site, but could only see smoke and rescue workers swarming around. He said the plane crashed into what looked like a farm field, just south of the Raisin River. Television film footage showed only a blackened gash in a snowy field. The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said the plane carried 25 passengers, two pilots and three flight attendants and that none survived. The flight originated in Cincinnati. One man who lived near the crash site told a Detroit radio station there was an ""unbelievable"" explosion and fireball when the plane crashed. Any plane carrying 70 or less is considered a commuter flight though some routinely operate under the same safety and flight rules that govern larger aircraft. In October 1994, icing caused a French-built American Eagle ATR-72 to crash in northern Indiana, killing all 68 on board. The plane's manufacturer later made revisions to de-icing equipment. CNN reported that the Brazilian-made Embraer-120 has been involved in 13 other crashes since 1986 where lives were lost, including an accident in Georgia that killed former Senator John Tower.

"Britain's final departure next year from its colony of Hong Kong will be sealed with a handshake, a British minister said on Tuesday, confirming the two countries would share one final last symbolic embrace. Beijing's top Hong Kong policymaker had indicated he was willing to join the British territory's last imperial governor at a ceremony to mark its return to China, said Jeremy Hanley, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Chinese official Lu Ping's willingness to join Britain's Governor Chris Patten in the limelight appeared to signal new willingness to set aside differences in the run-up to the colony's return to Beijing rule on July 1, 1997. ""I had confirmation from Lu Ping this morning that he is looking forward to shaking the governor's hand at the handover ceremony,"" Hanley told a news conference in Beijing. London and Beijing have long bickered over the arrangements for Hong Kong's mid-1997 transition to Chinese rule after more than 150 years, with disagreement over the handover ceremony once so entrenched that the prospects for a joint event seemed doubtful. Beijing, infuriated by Patten's drive to expand democracy in the colony ahead of its return, has tried to limit Britain's role, while London is keen to leave in imperial style. Britain in March signaled that a joint ceremony was in doubt, with diplomatic sources reporting that the main hurdle in talks was China's insistence that Patten should not attend. Hong Kong government radio reported late last month that Chinese and British negotiators could reach an outline agreement on the ceremony by the end of September, just nine months before the end of London's rule. A willingness to share the podium with the governor could reflect a muting of Chinese anger at Patten, who has long been the butt of scathing editorials in the Beijing media. Lu Ping has frequently shown reluctance to meet Patten during visits to the colony, although he has often had conferences with other British and Hong Kong officials. Hanley said differences remained to be settled on handover arrangements, but added progress had been made. ""We've had very useful discussions,"" he said. ""On the handover ceremony, the Chinese government agree that it should be grand, solemn and dignified, and fitting to the historical importance of the event,"" Hanley said. Britain and China say relations have warmed in recent months, boosted by high-level exchanges and a May trade visit to Beijing by British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine. Differences remained over China's determination to scrap Hong Kong's elected legislature, known as Legco, Hanley said. ""It is unnecessary for Legco, which has been duly elected, to be replaced before the end of its term in 1999,"" he said. While Hanley called for urgency to resolve outstanding disagreements before the 1997 handover, China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Lu Ping as saying ""minor differences"" did not necessarily have to be ironed out before the day arrived. ""We will try our best to solve minor differences before the first of July, 1997. If some of the differences cannot be solved by that day, it doesn't matter,"" Lu said. ""They can be resolved gradually by the Hong Kong people themselves."" ","MureDickie"
"Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel said Monday it cut its first-half losses and hoped an agreement could be reached soon on a vital bank debt restructuring. Losses after interest totalled 3.04 billion francs ($597 million), an improvement of 618 million francs ($121 million) from the same period in 1995. Since March, Eurotunnel had broken even at the operating level before financial charges and after operating expenses and capital expenditure. French co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said this proved it was economically viable but needed to lighten the debt burden. But the British and French co-chairmen differed over the timing of a deal to refinance 72 billion francs ($14 billion) of debt and unpaid interest owed to its 225-member bank syndicate. Eurotunnel has been in bank talks since it froze payments on its junior-ranked loans a year ago, after it undershot cash targets in 1995. A mandate for two mediators named by a Paris court to help negotiations expires at the end of September. Ponsolle told reporters he hoped for an agreement by the end of September, while his British counterpart, Alistair Morton, told Reuters in London he was allowing eight weeks to reach an accord with bankers. ""Our aim is still to reach an agreement on September 30,"" Ponsolle told reporters. He said there was a ""near-consensus"" on the instruments and the structure for the debt-restructuring. But the key question of sharing out the rewards remained. ""What is still being discussed is the division of pain and the hope of gains between shareholders and lenders,"" he said. Morton said: ""I reckon there's about eight hours of serious negotiation left to do, so I've allowed eight weeks for it. The banks have got plenty of time to get their act together and come to the table,"" he said. Morton, who has said he would resign when the debt talks were completed, said he will step down at the end of October. Eurotunnel's talks have been deadlocked over how much the banks should get out of the company's cash flow to repay debts and the amount that should go to shareholders who have seen their shares plummet. Ponsolle said Eurotunnel had always been sold as a long-term investment -- it was floated in 1987 and the first dividend was planned for 2004 -- and it would be unfair if the banks were get the rewards just as it started making money. Eurotunnel decided to reward shareholders' patience with discounts on the company's Le Shuttle trains and the Eurostar high-speed rail system, he said. Eurotunnel was headed for a 50 percent sales increase this year, on its 1995 turnover of 2.3 billion francs ($452 million), despite an expected slowing in sales in the second half of 1996, Ponsolle said. The company has provisioned 3.7 billion francs ($727 million) for interest due on its bank debt but unpaid since it froze payments on Sept. 14, 1995. ","PierreTran"
"Hong Kong's future lawmakers drew howls of protest from the pro-democracy camp on Saturday after they supported Beijing-backed plans to dilute civil liberties in the territory when it returns to China at midnight on June 30. The democratic camp also accused the future lawmakers of the provisional legislature of selling out the people of Hong Kong by merely doing Beijing's bidding. ""This group, anyway, was not popularly elected, what Beijing wants, it will pass. This is a foregone conclusion,"" said Tsang Kin-shing, a legislator of Hong Kong's current elected chamber and a member of the popular Democratic Party. ""They are just doing it for their own advantage, I don't have any hope in them. They are just selling out on Hong Kong people,"" he told Reuters by telephone. The outcry follows a meeting of the provisional legislature across the border in China's Shenzhen city earlier on Saturday, where members gave their backing to plans by Hong Kong's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, to place curbs on freedoms from July 1. The plans include requiring police permits for political protests and a ban on foreign funding of political groups. They have sparked protests from Hong Kong's lawyers and human rights activists, as well as from Britain and the United States. But the curbs, Tung argues, are necessary to preserve social order in Hong Kong, which will return to China on July 1 when more than 150 years of British colonial rule comes to an end. Tung's plans were widely expected after Beijing resolved in February to repeal or amend existing Hong Kong laws protecting freedoms and political rights. The 60-member interim chamber, which was selected in December under rules crafted by China, agreed with the broad principles of the planned curbs, which have yet to be drafted. ""Hong Kong's situation is sensitive, as at any time, but now especially Hong Kong people must be on the alert for the possibility of the region being infiltrated by hostile elements,"" said provisional legislator Elsie Tu. ""It is our responsibility to maintain public order and prevent interference by outside political parties."" Some, however, said the curbs must be reasonable and not restrict freedoms as Hong Kong people were usually law-abiding while others urged clearer definitions of some concepts in the proposed curbs to allay fears in Hong Kong. Tung has cited concepts such as ""national security"" as a basis for the planned curbs, but critics have criticised the idea as both alarmist and groundless. The planned curbs are widely expected to go through legislative procedures before the handover and be confirmed and made into Hong Kong laws on July 1 by the interim chamber. The China-backed provisional legislature has held its meetings in China rather than Hong Kong to protect itself from legal challenges by members of the elected chamber. China, angered by democratic reforms introduced by the last British governor, Chris Patten, has said it will disband the elected legislature and install the provisional body as Hong Kong's official lawmaking assembly after July 1. The future chamber also prepared to make its first law for Hong Kong on Saturday. A bill, covering public holidays for 1997 and 1998, passed through all three readings and will be confirmed as law on July 1, the local cable TV station reported. Andrew Cheng, a current legislator and Democratic Party member denounced the passage of the bill. ""The provisional legislature is an unconstitutional structure and they don't have any legal foundation to pass laws for Hong Kong,"" Cheng said on Radio Television Hong Kong. ","TanEeLyn"
"Biogen Inc expects to begin European marketing of Avonex, a multiple sclerosis drug, within the next 30 days and expects European sales eventually to match U.S. sales, President and Chief Operating Officer James Tobin said Wednesday. At a Raymond James investors conference here, Tobin said, ""I would expect we'll be on the European market within the next 30 days ... Ultimately, I would expect that our sales in Europe would approach our level of sales in the U.S.""   Avonex sales in 1996 totalled $76.5 million. Biogen's total 1996 sales were $277 million, up from $151.7 million in 1995. Biogen launched U.S. sales of Avonex -- the biotechnology pioneer's first major proprietary product -- in May 1996. Its sales have greatly boosted the company's revenue stream, previously comprised chiefly of royalties for hepatitis B vaccines and alpha interferon patents licensed to large pharmaceutical companies.   Avonex reduces the frequency and severity of multiple sclerosis flares and competes with Schering AG's Betaseron, as well as the recently approved Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. Biogen plans to expand revenues and earnings by selling more Avonex and getting it approved for uses other than multiple sclerosis, in addition to out-licensing other technologies, Tobin said. Biogen hopes to soon out-license Hirulog, a blood-thinning agent. ""We have found someone who is interested,"" Tobin said. The company also has new possible products in the pipeline, including a renal disorder treatment called OP-1, which is being developed jointly with Creative BioMolecules Inc , as well as other compounds. ""The point is that Biogen is not a one-drug story,"" Tobin said. ((--Chicago Newsdesk 312 408-8787)) ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"After 19 months of sometimes violent confrontations, six striking newspaper unions on Friday made an unconditional offer to return to work at Detroit's two major daily papers. Al Derey, head of the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions, said the action was not an act of surrender but a tactic to expose the papers to potentially huge financial losses if they do not agree to a fair contract. ""Our position is this strike has not ended. This is simply a new strategy to try to win a fair and decent contract from two corporate giants that don't have any souls,"" a visibly emotional Derey told a news conference. About 2,500 distribution, pressroom, newsroom and mailroom workers walked off their jobs at the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News in July 1995 after contract talks collapsed. The papers are editorially indepdendent and have separate owners but have been published under a joint operating agreement since 1989. Knight-Ridder Inc. owns the Free Press. The News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc. A representative from Detroit Newspapers Inc, the joint operating agency, could not be reached for comment. The papers have published every day since the strike began, although early on they only published a single joint edition. More than 400 of the original strikers have cross picket lines. The papers have hired about 1,400 replacements. Since the start of the strike, which has often erupted in violent confrontations between supporters and private security guards, circulation at the papers has fallen 30 percent. Advertising revenues are down between 15 percent and 20 percent. Derey told reporters the advertising boycott has cost the papers a combined $250 million, and 700,000 readers have dropped subscriptions. But because the newspapers ""still don't get it,"" he said the unions need to adopt a new strategy. If the papers reject the return-to-work offer, they could be liable for back pay from the time the offer was made if they were found to have commited unfair labor practices, said Derey. That amounts to $250,000 a day, or $1 million a year, he said. The action Friday is a controversial one for many union members, who are staunchly opposed to returning to work. But Derey appealed for their support. ""This wasn't the only strategy and it isn't the easiest, but it is the best way we've got to take on these corporate powers and get us moving again down the road to a fair contract,"" he said. One local labor analyst said the union's move was an acknowledgement the strike as a means of leverage has reached the point of diminishing returns. But it does force management to make some difficult decisions. ""What the unions are doing now is upping the legal ante,"" said Steve Babson, labor program specialist at Wayne State University's Labor Studies Center. If the papers do not agree to take back all of the striking workers, they could be liable for the back pay penalities if they commited unfair labor practices, a legal process that could take years to resolve, he said. The Detroit regional director of the NLRB has accused the companies of unfair labor practices, finding they did not bargain in good faith. The company appealed that decision to an administrative law judge, who has not yet issued a ruling. ","ToddNissen"
"North Korea said on Monday it would fire a top official marooned in South Koreas embassy in China if he sought asylum and Seoul went on alert for possible attack but said it wanted talks on the Cold War crisis. Pyongyangs Foreign Ministry, commenting on the highest level defection yet from the Stalinist nation, saying that if leading ideologue Hwang Jang-yop had been kidnapped, then North Korea would take ""decisive countermeasures"". ""Our stand is simple and clear. If he was kidnapped, we cannot tolerate it and we will take decisive countermeasures,"" the KCNA news agency, monitored in Tokyo, quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying. ""If he sought asylum, it means that he is a renegade and he is dismissed,"" it said, adding that it had asked Beijing to investigate what it called the disappearance of Hwang, who took refuge in Seouls mission in Beijing six days ago. North Koreas ambassador was believed to have met officials at Chinas Foreign Ministry on Monday. Hwangs defection has embarrassed his hermit homeland, delighted Seoul and mired Beijing in a quandary over how to usher him out of China without offending an old communist comrade or a new capitalist friend. But Hwang turned 74 on Monday with no sign of progress to celebrate in his appeal for asylum in the South, and still stranded in Seouls heavily guarded consulate in Beijing. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced U.S. concern over events on the Korean peninsula, saying they underlined the need for dialogue between rival North and South. South Korea prepared for possible attacks by Pyongyang as the Cold War crisis escalated, but said confrontation over the defector would not scuttle its efforts for detente. Another prominent defector, Li Il-nam, a nephew of North Korean leader Kim Jong-ils ex-wife, remained in a coma after being shot and critically wounded at the weekend by suspected North Korean agents near Seoul. Security around South Koreas ports, airports and other public places had been beefed up and 10,000 police and soldiers searched for the two suspected agents who shot Li. Seoul Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said problems stemming from Hwangs defection were just the start of headaches for Seoul because of a crisis in the North. ""I believe the North Korean regimes crisis will deepen as time passes because theres no likelihood of improvement in its economic hardship and food shortages, and signs of laxity in its social order,"" Yoo told a meeting of South Korean diplomats. South Koreas security-related ministers on Sunday agreed that a desperate Pyongyang resort to guerrilla attacks after Hwang, a top adviser the Norths Kim Jong-il, sought asylum. Dour warnings from North Korean officials in Beijing of the consequences of any attempt to move Hwang to the South gave a hint of Pyongyangs willingness to retaliate. ""If they make him go to Seoul, I think there will be war,"" said one North Korean official who declined to be identified. South Korean diplomats and Chinese police guarding the mission brought in extra blankets and mattresses in a sign they expected a lengthy stand-off over Hwang. However, dozens of North Korean officials disappeared on Monday afternoon from outside the building where they have kept a round-the-clock vigil since Hwang disappeared inside. China, an unwilling third party in the feuding between the two hostile ends of the Korean peninsula, has appealed to both sides to act calmly to resolve the affair. Analysts say the North has suffered huge loss of face over the defection of Hwang, who was ranked high in the hierarchy of his Stalinist homeland and was the architect of its governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance.

"The fight for control of Indonesia's rich Busang gold deposit has turned into an intense public relations battle rather than a traditional bidding war. Barrick Gold Corp.'s founder and Chairman Peter Munk took the offensive on Wednesday, trumpeting Barrick's history, financial structure and mining capabilities. Rival Placer Dome Inc. President John Willson has also kept a high public profile, lobbying in Indonesia to pursuade the government to give his company a chance to bid on Busang. While both companies have been wooing Indonesian reporters, explorer Bre-X Minerals Ltd., which discovered Busang, has hired public relations firm Hill and Knowlton to polish its image. Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X currently controls the deposit. The Indonesian government has told Bre-X to form a joint venture with Toronto-based Barrick to develop the 57 million ounce gold deposit. But Placer Dome has said it wants a chance to bid on the deposit too by forming a merger with Bre-X. ""I think that Barrick is the company that is going to be involved in Busang's development,"" Munk said in a Wednesday conference call with mining analysts that seemed instead to be addressed to the Indonesian government. ""Not because somebody writes a letter, not because somebody calls somebody, not because somebody's got a better partner or worse partner, but only because Barrick is the company that has the most outstanding credentials to do the right job for Indonesia,"" he said. Barrick has been criticized for using its high-profile board of advisers, which includes former U.S. President George Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, to write letters and make phone calls to powerful Indonesians in a bid to corner Busang. Barrick also has an alliance with the eldest daughter of Indonesian President Suharto. But Munk downplayed his company's influential ties, citing instead his company's strong finances, mining history, focus on gold and its experienced staff. ""Ultimately the right people will get this job and I think Barrick will qualify,"" Munk said. Placer Dome's Willson thinks otherwise. ""We've come to a point now where there's a reasonable chance there will be a standard Western-type of auction,"" Willson told Reuters in an interview in Vancouver this week. ""I think there's a 50-50 chance that's going to happen. When it comes to competitive bid, I think there will be two people essentially in that race -- ourselves and Barrick. The Indonesian government has instructed Bre-X and Barrick to work out a deal with their Indonesian partners at Busang by Feb. 17. ","HeatherScoffield"
"Canadian police said on Wednesday that they laid more charges in the widening sex scandal involving young boys at Maple Leaf Gardens, the fabled home of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Police on Wednesday filed 50 more charges of sexual abuse against Gordon Stuckless, 47, a former backstage helper at the Gardens. Stuckless, whose bail hearing was postponed to March 27, now faces 52 charges of indecent assault, gross indecency and buggery. Stuckless and another former Gardens' employee, John Paul Roby, allegedly lured teen-aged boys to the arena with free tickets and autographs of their hockey heroes. Roby is currently facing 75 charges of sexual abuse. Toronto police detective Dave Tredrea said the investigation was not over. ""If enough grounds come up and other suspects come up, then they will be charged accordingly,"" Tredrea said in a telephone interview. Police have said the abuse took place in the back rooms of the arena, sometimes during hockey games or other events. The sordid tale, which may involve up to 90 victims between the late 1960s and early 1990s, has grabbed newspaper headlines across the country. The scandal surfaced after 34-year-old Martin Kruze came forward with allegations of sexual abuse. ""Maple Leaf Gardens was a sex haven of abused boys, tons of them,"" Kruze has said of the abuse he said started when he was 13. Meanwhile, Gardens management has named a Toronto police veteran to review security at the arena. Retired deputy police chief Walter Tyrrell has said his review will include how the company screens potential employees. It's not the only sex abuse case to rock hockey this year. Graham James, one of Canada's top junior coaches, pleaded guilty in January to sexually assaulting two players in the 1980s and was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison. James admitted to more than 300 instances of sexual assault over six years against Boston Bruins player Sheldon Kennedy, who was 14 when the assaults began in 1984. The revelations hit hard in a nation where it is traditional for parents of boys with pro hockey aspirations to turn their children over to the care of junior coaches, often far from home.

"Chinese officials sent out positive signals about Beijing's future handling of Hong Kong on Friday, and diplomats indicated China and Britain had agreed on a VIP guestlist for a grand handover party. Hong Kong reverts to communist-ruled China at midnight on June 30 after a century and a half as a British colony, and is to retain its separate capitalist system for 50 years. Chinese officials attending a seminar on the transition sought to assure Hong Kong there will be no influx of mainland Chinese and that the future garrison will not misbehave. They also tried to ease fears that the economy in the capitalist enclave of 6.4 million people will suffer and stressed the need to allow Hong Kong businessmen to travel. Wang Fengchao, deputy head of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, dismissed fears that China would open the flood gates to migrants cashing in on Hong Kong's economic miracle. He said there were strict rules on entry into Hong Kong, and children of illegal immigrants would not be allowed in. ""These provisions...will have a deterrent effect,"" he said. The general who guards the political purity of China's future Hong Kong garrison said the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would not meddle in local government or business affairs. ""The Hong Kong garrison and government will be independent military and administrative systems with no affiliate relationship and will not interfere with each other,"" said the garrison's political commissar, Major-General Xiong Zi Ren. ""I can categorically tell you that we resolutely will abide by all regulations set out in the law,"" Xiong said. ""We have already set a rule that bans involvement in production business,"" he said. Tackling another issue worrying Hong Kong emigrants around the world, Wang announced a grace period for them to return to the territory if they want to keep permanent residency rights. An estimated 750,000 of Hong Kong's 6.4 million people have foreign citizenship. The bulk have made Canada, Australia, Britain or the United States their adopted homes. If they are abroad for long after July 1 they might lose their Hong Kong permanent residency. Wang said China was prepared to allow them a grace period, but the length of time would be set by the post-handover Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). ""As to the length of time they are allowed to stay outside Hong Kong, this is for the SAR to decide,"" he said. Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the future cabinet of Hong Kong Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa, said he believed the period would be up to three years. Britain, meanwhile, signaled it had agreed with China on the broad outlines of a guest list for the joint celebration of the handover to China three months from now. A British official told Reuters the two sides would invite a total of about 3,200 guests to the event. About 400 ""international guests"" would be included. Some would be government ministers and the heads of international organisations, said the official, who asked not to be named. But China and Britain did not expect heads of government or heads of state. One diplomat said this was a sign China had won in its efforts not to give Britain too glorious a send-off. Hong Kong's colonial Chief Secretary Anson Chan, who is keeping her job under Tung, said in Canada on Thursday China was fully committed to granting Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. ""It is clear the Chinese leaders are fully committed to the faithful implementation of the late Deng Xiaoping's visionary concept of 'one country, two systems' and Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong,"" Chan said. ""There is a clear appreciation that only in this way can Hong Kong best serve the interests of China,"" she said. However, the United States said on the same day that China had sent mixed and sometimes disturbing signals on the future of Hong Kong's legislature, human rights and press freedom after Beijing takes control on July 1. ""Over the past year, developments in Hong Kong have sent mixed signals about some aspects of the change in sovereignty,"" the State Department said in a report to Congress. ""There have been significant positive developments since March 1996,"" it said. But ""China's actions regarding the future of the legislature and the laws governing human rights and civil liberties in Hong Kong have been disturbing and have caused concern in both Hong Kong and the international community."" China has set in motion plans to replace Hong Kong's elected legislature with an appointed body and to water down liberal laws protecting civil liberties and democracy. ","PeterHumphrey"
"British cider maker Matthew Clark outlined a recovery plan on Tuesday aimed at tackling the phenomenal rise in popularity of ""alcopops"" and a cut throat industry-wide price war. ""We have drawn a line under the issues we face,"" said business development director Peter Huntley in an interview. The company estimates it will lose 22 miillion pounds ($36.80 million) over the year from a combination of lower sales and tougher competition over pricing and supply contracts to national and regional brewers. Sales of Diamond White and K cider were off some 30 percent due to the emergence of ""alcopops"", costing Matthew Clark about 11 million pounds in annual profits. ""The decline in Diamond White and K is still in progress, but it is a quiet period of the year and our marketing plan will hit the market in April and we expect it to arrest the decline very quickly,"" he said. Alcopops -- cola and fruit flavoured alcoholic drinks -- have grown to annualised sales of 80 million litres a year in 18 months and hit sales of Diamond White, the dominant premium packaged cider brand, six times more than premium lagers. Price competition produced deep promotional discounts in supermarkets and will cost Matthew Clark about four million pounds in lost profits at the full year, said Huntley. ""The level of discounting and below the line price support, and promotional support this summer has been at levels which have just not been seen in the cider industry for the last five years,"" he said. ""For example on a two-litre Old English and Blackthorn, the discounting we had to do this summer to match the market was to take 30 percent off the price, so it was down from 2.99 pounds and 3.19 pounds to 1.99 pounds."" But Huntley said Clark ""expects to pull back on the level of promotional discount"" that went on during the summer. Matthew Clark now has a 38 percent market share, down some three to four percentage points over the last year, putting it well behind its larger rival Bulmer HP Holdings Plc which has some 52 percent of the market. The company unveiled a plan to spend more on advertising in an effort to rebuild its cider brands, including a new campaign for Diamond White aimed at bringing back 18 to 24-year-old drinkers and the relaunch of Blackthorn in the spring. It also pledged to increase prices from this month and do away with deep promotional discounts in supermarkets. Matthew Clark shares rose 30p to 330p by early afternoon with analysts saying they liked the frank way the company had presented its recovery strategy. The company's shares plunged 60 percent after a profits warning in September, wiping more than 290 million pounds off its market value. ""They gave an open, frank and honest assessment of what there problems were and what they are going to do to sort them out,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst John Beaumont. ""A lot depends on how Bulmer will react, of course. Will they both stop cutting each other's throats and stop chasing each other's accounts?"" he said. ($1=.5979 Pound) ","TimFarrand"
"Chinese copper producers could soon start selling their red metal to take advantage of current high prices -- and before a long-awaited correction hits the international market, Chinese traders said on Friday. London Metal Exchange (LME) copper, currently hovering close to its highest price in almost a year, is ready for a correction and Chinese producers want to get what they can before the price fall begins, a Shanghai copper trader said. ""Chinese producers have begun to sell domestically at these prices because they don't believe they will last,"" he said. Prices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME), which often move in tandem with the LME, rose on Friday morning, in what one trading source in the city said was a reflection of local fundamentals. ""Once the local selling becomes a factor here, the price in Shanghai will correct,"" he said. Shanghai copper futures opened mostly up on Friday. The most active June 1996 contract opened at 23,650 yuan ($2,851) per tonne, up 300 yuan from Thursday's close. It moved around that level early in the session. Traders on the SME said copper was likely to consolidate in a range of 23,000 to 24,000 yuan ($2,771-2,891) in the short term with buyers and sellers having mixed views over its direction. LME copper see-sawed in trade on Thursday, breaching the $2,400 resistance level at the afternoon kerb. It closed at $2,403 per tonne, up $28 on the day, after fund buying at the midday dips spurred the price up. Shanghai traders said they expected the funds to begin selling, bringing the correction with them in the process. Traders and analysts here have said the LME copper price is not supported by fundamentals and that the market is waiting for Chinese buying to begin. China's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes, up 5.71 percent on 1995, according to State Statistical Bureau figures. Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes. Chinese media reported in January that China's 1997 copper demand should rise five percent over last year to 1.05 million tonnes. Output is expected to be more than 900,000 tonnes. Copper imports are expected to remain high, media reports have said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent to 714,248 tonnes. Western traders and those elsewhere in the region agreed China needed to buy copper, but those polled by Reuters were unanimous that China appeared to be holding off on its buying programme while prices remained high. But Chinese buyers are not known for entering the market at the bottom of a correction, instead, they are likely to wait for prices to rise again before coming in, Shanghai traders said. ""I think $2,100 to $2,200 (per tonne on the LME) would be a good price because China will need to buy, they are short of copper every year,"" said an executive in Shanghai with a European metal producer. She said the crackdown on scrap imports, part of China's campaign last year against the import of foreign garbage, would lead to a rise in Chinese need for cathode. ""Domestic prices are still moving up, I guess because stocks are getting low,"" she said. ""They will have to buy eventually."" Figures released last Friday by the SME show exchange warehouse copper stocks at 23,407 tonnes. But local traders have said this figure has barely changed in recent months and the big question is the tonnage off-warrant, that is, the amount of copper not registered on the exchange but still available to the market. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-8544 ","LynneO'Donnell"
"Australian industrial conglomerate Pacific Dunlop Ltd has dived into red ink in an effort to put two years of ""sobering"" financial woes behind it, declaring on Friday a full-year loss of A$132 million. The group's earnings for the year to June 30 included a net abnormal loss of A$296 million, reflecting management's decision to cast off its troubled U.S. medical equipment unit and book over A$80 million in restructuring charges and asset writedowns.   ""This is a clean-out result and it gives both myself and my managenent team an absolutely clean slate on which to write the next chapter of Pacific Dunlop's history,"" group managing director Rod Chadwick said in announcing the result. Pacific Dunlop's recent history has been dominated by severe problems faced by its Telectronics subsidiary, which is now up for sale after a defect in one of its cardiac-implant products effectively put the unit out of business for 13 months. ""We have so far had six deaths from this problem over the last two years,"" Chairman John Gough told reporters.   The problem was first detected in Telectronics Accufix pacemaker lead in late 1994. Telectronics' losses accounted for A$340 million of gross abnormal losses, including a provision of A$91 million for the expected loss on the eventual sale of the business. ""We are in very advanced negotiations,"" said Gough, who called the problem with the pacemaker leads ""in many ways ... an act of God"" and unforeseeable. ","MarkBendeich"
"Summit Medical Systems Inc., said Monday its 1996 revenues will be ""substantially less"" than what it reported last week due to accounting discrepancies discovered by its new chief financial officer, who resigned after less than a week on the job. The company, which makes computer-based information systems for the healthcare industry, said it expected to revise downward the $19.5 million in revenues it reported in 1996, and could also cut revenues for 1995 and 1994 as well. Company officials were not available to comment. Summit's shares fell by $1.44, or 30 percent, to $3.31 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market. Volpe, Welty &amp; Co. analyst Chris Paul said Summit was believed to have about $40 million in cash and roughly 10.5 million shares. ""So it's trading below its cash value,"" he said. Still, he added, the cash the company is believed to have was ""providing a base for the shares."" Minneapolis-based Summit said a preliminary review of its books indicated that revenues for the past three years had been overstated by between $4 million and $6 million -- or between 8 percent and 12 percent of the total. Summit said the concerns over its revenues stem from the erroneous recognition of some revenues from the sales of software and related services. Paul said the company did not provide any further explanation to analysts on a conference call. ""Summit Medical is extremely concerned by the discovery of accounting errors and is working vigorously to correct past mistakes and to establish stricter management controls and policies,"" Chief Executive Kevin Green said in a statement. The company also announced that it planned to eliminate an unspecified number of jobs and establish a cost reduction programme to reduce annual expenses by 20 percent. That programme is expected to result in an unspecified charge in the current quarter for employee severance and other costs, it said. Last Wednesday, Summit reported 1996 revenues of $19.5 million, up from $17.7 million in 1995. It also posted a net loss for the year of $10.4 million, compared with a year-ago loss of $7.2 million. The exact size of the adjustments to revenue and the years in which they apply will not be determined until an extensive audit is completed, the company said Monday. Summit said that Donald Haas, who joined the company as chief financial officer last Monday, resigned Saturday -- after informing management that some 1996 revenue had been incorrectly recognised. The company said that Haas told management on Thursday, the day after the company reported its 1996 results, that it had incorrectly recognised revenue during 1996 in some circumstances. Management immediately began a review of these issues, it added. ""The company's auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, have expanded the scope of their audit and are performing additional audit procedures based in part on the questions raised by Mr. Haas,"" Summit said in its statement. Summit added that it had retained the law firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP to investigate the matter with the assistance of independent accounting advice from Arthur Andersen LLP. The company said it expected to announce corrected financial information by the end of March. The likely downward revision of revenues for at least a year comes at a time when Summit is in the midst of a product transition, said Paul. The transition, Paul explained, is to a single platform for Summit's computerized information system, which collects and analyses patient data and likely outcomes. This anlaysis enables health care providers to monitor and potentially change a patient's treatment. ","PatriciaCommins"
"Banyan Strategic Realty Trust, which releases its full 1996 results early next week, will report funds from operations (FFO) of $0.03 a share for the 1996 fourth quarter, down from $0.07 a share a year ago. Leonard Levine, chief executive of the real estate investment trust also said Friday that funds from operations for the year ended December 31 would be $0.34 a share, up from $0.32 a share a year ago. But the company expects funds from operations, the standard measure of a REITs performance, to jump in 1997.   ""In 1997, we expect our targeted numbers for FFO, both as a result of acquisitions made in late '96 and continuing acquisitions in early '97...will be somewhere between $0.50 and $0.55,"" Levine said in an interview. The company's target for 1998 FFO is $0.65 to $0.70 a share, not including additional acquisitions, which it expects to make. By June 30 of this year, Banyan expects to own 19 properties in the Midwest and Southeast, including industrial buildings, suburban office buildings, apartment complexes and a retail center.   ""Real estate is cyclical and the best way to protect against that cycle is to spread your risk,"" Levine said in explaining Banyan's strategy, which is counter to most REITs, which focus on one property sector. The company focuses on markets without much competition from larger REITs.   ""Our principal investment strategy is to focus on smaller real estate markets and smaller properties where we believe there continues to be extraordinary opportunities available to us to purchase stable and appreciating real estate and where the economies are both very strong and there continues to be an absence of credit and capital,"" Levine said. Banyan buys properties with an eye toward both improving its revenue stream and selling at a profit down the road. The company hopes to speed its portfolio growth in coming years and Levine expects Banyan to make some sort of equity offering in the next year to raise market capital. ""I think sometime within the next 12 months we'll be exploring ways in which the company can grow from that perspective,"" Levine said of a potential equity offering. Among the benefits from an equity offering would be to improve Banyan's liquidity, he added. Shares of the company closed Wednesday at four and have not traded since.

"Alcatel Alsthom said on Monday it was in talks with Aerospatiale and Dassault about a joint offer for the government's 58-percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF . Prime Minister Alain Juppe said a decision about the procedure for the privatisation of Thomson-CSF would be made before the end of February. ""There are discussions with the companies mentioned in the press,"" an Alcatel spokesman said when asked to react to newspaper reports about a joint bid. Industry sources said that Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk had kept the government informed about his plans to form an alliance with Aerospatiale and Dassault in order to win the Thomson-CSF stake. An industry analyst, who prefered not to be named, said the new plan improved the credibility of Alcatel's offer. Alcatel in October lost out to the Lagardere Groupe in bidding for state-controlled Thomson SA, which has a stake in Thomson-CSF as well as 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM). But the government had to suspend the sale on December 4 after the independent Privatisation Commission rejected terms for the sale by Lagardere of TMM to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea. A decision about the procedure for the relaunch of the sale, either by a private placement or a public sale, was originally expected at the end of January. ""I think that in the days to come, between now and the end of February, we will be in a position to announce very clearly the procedure, which I want to be as clear and as transparent as possible,"" Juppe said in an interview on French radio. ""All candidacies will obviously be examined in the context of the procedures we decide on,"" he said. Dassault and Aerospatiale, which are currently in talks about a merger of their aircraft activities, had no comment. President Jacques Chirac said a year ago that he wanted to restructure the French defence industry around a merger of Aerospatiale/Dassault and Thomson-CSF. A joint bid by the aerospace group and Alcatel would speed up this restructuring. But the situation could be difficult because Aerospatiale is state-owned and the state would be the main shareholder of the merged group with Dassault. ""It is complicated but not impossible,"" an industry source said. According to French newspapers, Aerospatiale would transfer its missiles and satellites business to Thomson-CSF and Dassault its electronics activties, now part of Dassault Electronique. Alcatel would merge its own defence activities into Thomson-CSF. It would become the main shareholder of the enlarged group which would be Europe's biggest defence company and the world's third biggest after Lockheed Martin and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas Corp. At Lagardere Groupe there was no immediate comment. Lagardere shares closed 1.59 percent lower at 154.70 francs on the news of the strengthened Alcatel bid. Alcatel, which rose strongly last week, closed 1.09 percent lower at 542 francs. ","MarcelMichelson"
"Tumbling trade barriers are triggering huge telecoms alliances as companies struggle to straddle the world and offer lucrative services to multinational companies. But not even the biggest telecoms companies know where the revolution will end. U.S. giant AT&amp;T Corp's chairman Robert Allen was quoted last year as saying: ""One could reasonably expect the chairman of AT&amp;T to know what his corporation will be 10 years from now. He doesn't. ""One could, within reason, expect the chairman of AT&amp;T to be able to predict how technology will transform his business a decade hence. He can't. ""At least, he should know who his major competitors will be in 2005. Stumped again. ""But here is what he does know: something startling, intriguing and profound is afoot."" A FUTURE FRAUGHT WITH DANGERS Some telecom analysts warn that large-scale investment at a time of global expansion and competition will hit the margins and revenues of former cash-rich monopolies. ""Of the world's major telecom companies, I would not be surprised if one of them, in the next five to 10 years, becomes perceived as a high risk company,"" says Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers. BOOM IN MERGERS FORECAST As telecoms companies jostle to fill the gaps in the global reach of their business, analysts are predicting an unprecedented surge of B mergers and acquisitions in the $800 billion world telecoms industry. World trade liberalisation is expected to lead to global mega-carriers that will try to capture the entire profit margin from the traffic of multinational firms with offices in the United States, Europe and the Far East. Harrington estimates that the top 5,000 multinational corporate customers account for 15-20 percent of global telecoms revenue. To be able to service them, carriers need asset bases in all the countries where they operate. EXPLOSIVE GROWTH MAY HELP MARGINS While analysts agree that competition will become ferocious, some brush aside those who urge caution and argue that explosive growth will help maintain the margins of well-placed companies. ""Something like two thirds of the world's population live more than a day's walk away from the nearest telephone,"" says John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at brokers SocGen. ""There's a whole world out there waiting to get in touch."" In the last 12 months, potential mergers have run to tens of billions of dollars as carriers such as MFS WorldCom British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp, Bell Atlantic /NYNEX and SBC/Pacific Telesis announced plans to join forces. MARKET FORCES BATTER TELECOM MONOPOLIES Because the cost of making calls is expected to reflect more closely the cost of delivering them, consumers will soon no longer pay the vastly inflated prices that have helped line the pockets of bloated national carriers. The advent of high bandwidth cable and modern switching systems also means that, according to some broker estimates, the cost of delivering a telephone call is about a thousand times cheaper than 40 years ago. A number of firms, facing margin-shrinking competition at home and aiming to service corporations, have formed three main global partnerships. BT and its American partner MCI have formed an alliance called Concert; Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint have linked up to form Global One. AT&amp;T, the world's second largest telecoms company, has also set up loosely-knit partnerships called Unisource and World Partners. Telecommuncations used to be rather simple: Spend money to fix your network, cut capital expenditure and staffing levels and wait for the cash to start piling up. The more money is spent on a network, the greater the cash flows allowed by regulators to support its renewal, and the greater the potential free cash-flow improvement, when savings are eventually enjoyed. But a brave, new world is on the horizon, and the only telecoms stocks Harrington tips for investors are those which enjoy double-digit growth, are gaining share in their existing markets, and have assets in place to execute strategic plans -- or have a unique niche. CABLE &amp; WIRELESS PROVIDES A RARE ASSET BASE Such firms could include Cable and Wireless, Britain's second biggest telecoms company, which analysts say combines an attractive home asset base with rare access to booming Asian markets. C&amp;W has a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications, described as one of the best assets in Asia because it is not only majority held by non-government investors, but has potentially unique access to China and already faces competition at home. 'CONCERT' IS BANKING ON JAPAN BT is also hoping that its planned takeover of MCI will make it more attractive as a potential partner to Asian companies such as Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's largest telecoms titan. But the MCI deal has led rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's to put BT on ""CreditWatch with negative implications."" ""The expected downgrade of BT's (AAA) ratings reflect the company's increased business risk and weakened business profile resulting from its ($22 billion) acquisition of MCI,"" S&amp;P said last month. Nevertheless, most analysts welcomed the proposed merger as a strategic necessity to create a viable, competitive group with a broad geographical reach. As the U.S. market opens further, and since Europe created its single market in 1988, around 80 percent of the global telecoms market, by revenue, will be either completely or substantially deregulated by 1998 compared with about 20 percent today. ""The next two years will see the most significant period of reform in telecommunications history,"" says Salomon Brothers's Harrington. ","KirstinRidley"
"Czech consumer inflation continued its gradual downtrend in January, but analysts said they do not expect a loosening of the central bank's tight monetary policy in the short-term. The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said January inflation, month-on-month, was 1.2 percent, putting the year-on-year rate at 7.4 percent, down from 8.6 percent the previous month. The key sliding average inflation figure, which uses 1993 as a base, edged down to 8.7 percent from 8.8 percent in December, and was down from 9.1 percent in January 1996. ""The January number is very good, about one percentage point lower than a year ago,"" Kamil Janacek, cheif economist at Komercni Banka told Reuters. ""If prices and some deregulations develop accoridng to plan in the next months, and thanks to producer prices being under five percent...there is a high probability that 1997 inflation could end at around, or just under, eight percent,"" he added. The CSU said in a report that the biggest influences on the January inflation rate were food, drinks and tobacco products which rose 1.3 percent in the month, transportation which rose 3.6 percent and housing which rose by 1.3 percent. It added that of the 1.2 percent month-on-month rate, seasonal influences accounted for 0.23 percent, putting the seasonally-adjusted monthly rate at 0.97 percent. CSU figures show price deregulation influenced the seasonally-adjusted rate by 0.63 percent, while seasonally-adjusted core inflation was 0.34 percent. Despite the downtrend, most analysts agreed that there seems little chance the Czech National Bank (CNB), the central bank, will ease its tight monetary policy in the near future despite the sustained downtrend in CPI. Curbing inflation has been at the heart of almost all of the CNB's policies, and both CNB and government officials have said they expect rates to remain high, at least over the near term. ""The month-on-month rate appears favourable,"" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings, said. ""While there may be some room for it, I doubt the central bank will lower rates immediately -- maybe in the second quarter at the earliest,"" he added. Last summer the CNB raised its key discount rate one percentage point to 10.5 percent, and hiked minimum reserve requirements to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent of deposits to squeeze off surging domestic demand. The moves have appeared to signficantly slow growth in the money supply, which is now at the lower end of the central bank's 13 to 17 percent growth target. But central bank officials have warned that wage growth -- which was up 21.2 percent in nominal terms in December according to preliminary figures -- and its influence on inflation is a growing concern. ""The government has to somehow limit wage growth. It's just too high and this must be addressed before the central bank will move rates,"" said one London-based economist. Foreign exchange traders said the crown was unaffected by January's CPI figures since they were in line with forecasts. The crown was fixed by the central bank on Monday at 5.28 percent above its dollar/mark basket midpoint, slightly stronger than its +5.14 percent fixing from last Friday. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","AlanCrosby"
"Seeking to show its readiness to compete in high-speed networking, Bay Networks Inc on Tuesday unveiled a set of products and strategies aimed at shoring up its reputation as a technology leader and helping it recover from the stumbles of recent years. David House, Bay's recently hired chairman and chief executive, outlined the company's new ""Adaptive Networking"" strategy for making the plumbing of Internet-based networks easier to upgrade to the higher-speed networks now emerging.   ""Everybody's goal is networks that are invisible to the user,"" House said during a Las Vegas press conference at Networld+Interop, the semiannual trade show of the Internet equipment industry. ""We want networks that behave like electricity and water,"" House said, comparing computer networks to other well-developed infrastructures. ""Adaptive Networks are the products and technologies that will transition us to the Internet-optimized networks of tomorrow,"" he said.   His appearance came exactly six months after House joined Bay Networks from Intel Corp, where he served as a respected senior executive for more than two decades. Highlighting the company's new product announcements was a new single, application-specific networking chip capable of carrying up to 1.5 million packets of Internet data a second --- allowing networks to carry billions of bits of data per second. The company said the new Route Switch Processor (RSP) integrates the manageability of routers with the speed of switches -- two traditionally separate product categories.   House said the RSP chip, now running in Bay laboratories, would be offered in new routing switch products due out in 1998. The RSP chip is designed to solve the growing demand for high-speed Internet transmission, while reducing technical bottlenecks that cause congestion on overloaded data networks. House said RSP would serve as the core technology in its main product lines, including local networks used in corporate offices and in products serving telephone and Internet carriers.   He said the chip would allow Bay to cut switch product prices tenfold over time, driving the cost of advanced switching down to $500 per connection from $5,000 currently. Sounding like the old chip revolution evangelist he is, House described what he said were the semiconductor-driven dynamics of the networking business, which is seeing benefits from both exponential jumps in the power of computer chip technology and commodity-style price cuts.

"Caterpillar Inc remains concerned that continued strength of the dollar could pressure its pricing, though the impact was not that great in the first quarter. ""So far...  the impact's been very minimal and a large part of that is the fact that we've restructured our business so we know how to manage an overvalued dollar,"" Douglas Oberhelman, chief financial officer of the Peoria, Illinois-based heavy equipment maker, said in an interview.   That restructuring includes more overseas production, he said. But the continued strength in the dollar, which is at a multi-year high against the yen, could lead to pricing competition from Japanese competitors later this year, Oberhelman said. ""No question that if the dollar continues to be overvalued and continues to be strong, we'll see some price erosion later in the year,"" Oberhelman said.   ""So far, it's not been the predatory pricing that we've seen in the past from our competitors,"" he said. Earlier Tuesday, Caterpillar said it expected 1997 profits to rise from 1996 on ""moderately higher"" sales. That forecast anticipates additional tightening by the Federal Reserve this year.

Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp and Minnesota-based NRG Energy Inc, which last month combined to buy control of Australia's richest power station and coal mine, said they were eyeing other major investments in Australia and Southeast Asia. ""Both companies here are very active in the Asian region,"" said David Weaver, of CMS Asia, after settling the A$4.75-billion (US$3.7-billion) Australian purchase. ""This is not the first pot shot at a project. This is part of a very clear strategy of building a business across the region, not just picking up the odd project..."" Weaver and the U.S.-based chiefs of CMS and NRG were in Melbourne to present the Victoria state government a cheque for the Loy Yang A power station and coal mine. The sale of the 2,000-megawatt plant, the most efficient in Australia, stands as the nation's single biggest privatisation. CMS, which took 50 percent of Loy Yang, and NRG, which took 25 percent, said on Monday they would be natural partners for other major investments in Australia or elsewhere in the region.   ""There will be, before too long, another large project where we would work together, whether that be here or in Southeast Asia,"" said NRG's Asia-Pacific chief, David Scaysbrook. ""Both companies are actively interested in pursuing privatisations...,"" he told a joint media briefing. He cited Indonesia, saying it was looking to sell a part or all of its electricity generating system, as well as possible sales of state-owned assets in the Philippines and Thailand. CMS aims to build its offshore asset base to 40 percent of the group, with Southeast Asia the likely home for most of this capital, said CMS chief operating officer Vic Fryling. CMS now has 20 percent of its US$9 billion asset base in offshore investments and is active in 10 Asian countries. It runs India's only independent power station, a gas-fired plant in Andhra Pradesh state. It also runs three plants in the Philippines and is developing a gas business there, Weaver said. ""We are looking at the commercial nuclear plants in the Philippines,"" he added. CMS is an integrated energy company that spreads its investment from gas exploration to electricity generation. NRG focuses mainly on electricity generation.   NRG is soon to close a deal on building and operating a joint venture coal-fired power station in West Java, Indonesia. The deal, to be closed in four to six weeks, will be followed by ""our second deal in Asia in the next few months"", said NRG's Scaysbrook. He said the investment involved gas-fired power generation but declined to say more. NRG's parent, Northern States Power Co, is dependent on NRG for earnings growth and, in turn, NRG is looking to Asia to help deliver, said NRG chief executive David Paterson. ""We (NRG) have committed to them (NSP) that we will provide 20 percent of their earnings by the year 2000, and we are a little bit less than half of that at the moment,"" Paterson said.

"British composite insurer Commercial Union Plc posted a strong rise in first quarter profits on Wednesday, helped by a sharp fall in U.S. weather claims. Chief executive John Carter described the company's prospects as ""excellent"" but the shares trimmed 10-1/2 pence to 739 pence after the figures, which were in the middle of analysts' forecast range. Pre-tax operating profits rose to 102 million pounds ($166.4 million), up from 83 million pounds last year. Excluding the negative impact of sterling, profits were up 46 percent. On the same basis profits and new business sales at the group's worldwide life business rose 25 percent. Net assets per ordinary share were up 23 pence over the quarter to 568 pence. Echoing comments made by General Accident which reported on Tuesday, Commercial Union said the rating environment remained competitive in UK general insurance though there was evidence of firming in certain classes of business. A fall in weather losses helped U.S. results and France and Australia also saw increases in profits. Weather claims in the U.S. fell 23 million pounds over the period to 6 million pounds as a result of the milder winter. Finance director Peter Foster dismissed recent concerns about exposure to possible U.S. tobacco-related insurance claims. ""Commercial Union has very limited exposure to tobacco. We believe our policies have clear exclusion clauses and our exposure is not significant,"" Foster told Reuters. In the UK, weather costs were broadly flat. But the incidence of subsidence, a result of the dry start to the year, rose over the quarter. Claims were up 11 percent while the cost increased to 11 million pounds from seven million pounds in the first quarter last year. General insurance profits rose to 67 million pounds, up three million pounds over 1996 but continuing competition in the UK reduced general insurance profits there. ""The UK rating environment remains competitive though there is evidence of rates trying to move upwards - particularly in motor classes,"" Foster said. ""Other rates are relatively stable on the personal lines side. On commercial lines the market remains competitive but the rate of reduction being seen has actually declined."" In the U.S. general insurance also remained competitive with overall average rate increases broadly in line with inflation. France was seeing rises in certain classes but areas such as motor cover were becoming more difficult, said Foster. Asked about disappointing first quarter new sales in France where new single premium business fell 16 percent, Foster said he was confident about the quality of the business and the prospects for the future. French first quarter 1996 figures had been very strong and a rise in interest rates and reorganisation of the sales force had not helped comparisons, he said. With the acquisition of 73 percent of SEV, a French life assurer in April, life operations now account for around 50 percent of total group premium income. This is likely to continue to rise in the future, said Foster. ""Life business tends to grow at a faster rate than general and we expect that to continue in the future. A lot of the growth will be organic. We can achieve a pretty high level of organic growth but if a suitable opportunity arose we would certainly consider it,"" he said. Life profits over the quarter increased to 62 million pounds from 58 million pounds last year, with strong performances from the UK, the Netherlands and France. The company had an open mind about a life acquisition, said Foster, but it was not actively seeking them. ($ = 0.613 British Pounds) ","SimonCowell"
"Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged lawmakers on Thursday to put off consideration of controversial proposals that would allow banks to merge with commercial companies, such as carmakers. Instead, he said Congress should press ahead with more modest financial reforms that would knock down the 60-year-old legal barriers that prevent banks from affiliating with insurance companies and securities firms. ""Congress should widen the permissible range of affiliations for banking organisations in order to expand the choices for consumers and increase the efficiency of financial markets,"" Greenspan told the House Banking Committee. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the Clinton administration's plan to allow banks to get into the securities and insurance businesses. But Rubin sidestepped the controversial question of whether banks should be allowed to merge with commercial companies, instead offering Congress two proposals -- one that would allow such combinations, and another that would not. Greenspan acknowledged that the barriers separating banks and commercial companies will eventually crumble with the continued advance of technology. But he urged caution in knocking them down now, in part because of uncertainties over how that would affect the U.S. financial system. ""Any wider authorisation of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernisation,"" Greenspan said. The administration plan would allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to compete directly under a uniform set of regulations. That increased competition should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, according to Rubin. The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, took its place with several bills already introduced in Congress to overhaul the Glass Steagall Act of 1933. ""We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative,"" Rubin said. Congress and the banking industry have been working to reform the law for more than a decade without success. But this year, previous opponents of reform have come to the table as regulators and courts have chipped away at the law and granted banks some new powers. ","AaronPressman"
"AT&amp;T Corp is hoping to use its new local calling service for businesses to take valuable customers away from regional Bell competitors, appealing to those that want a single bill for a package of services. Jeff Weitzen, executive vice president for AT&amp;T business markets, said that while the company would initially provide local service by reselling the networks of local phone companies, many customers would soon be found valuable enough to get their own AT&amp;T digital line.   ""In essence what we announced today was only our launching pad,"" Weitzen told Reuters in an interview on Monday. AT&amp;T announced two services designed to make further inroads in the business calling markets where it already reaps $20 billion of annual revenue. AT&amp;T Business Local Service, aimed at those who spend less than $2,500 per month, offers local calling on a single bill with any other AT&amp;T service. It is being launched in California on February 3, with other states to follow.   The second, AT&amp;T Digital Link, offers outbound local calling in 35 states over existing digital lines. AT&amp;T will install its own lines to customers spending more than $2,500 a month, making it easier to offer high-speed data, Internet and other services. By the end of February, Digital Link, which has been tested with 2,500 customers, will be available in 45 states. Weitzen hopes to bring customers aboard with the first offer, use a package to calculate what they spend, then pull them across to the more profitable second offering.   ""A large number of customers don't have digital facilities, but when you bundle up the various offerings, they take will cross that ($2,500) line rather quickly,"" he said. By the end of this year, Business Local Service will be offered across large parts of the country using the circuits of regional Bells under resale agreements, most of which are still under negotiation. For the moment AT&amp;T only has a resale deal with Pacific Telesis Group for California and is close to finalizing one with Ameritech Corp.   AT&amp;T's California coverage plans are hindered by the lack of an agreement with GTE Corp, which has several calling regions in California. Also by the end of this year, a third version of Digital Link software will allow users to cut out regional Bells completely from both inbound and outbound calling, with even 911 emergency calls and local directory-assistance calls being handled via AT&amp;T. As part of that upgrade, AT&amp;T will need to pass regulatory hurdles in the states concerned. ","NickLouth"
"Apple Computer Inc. will lay off more employees this year as part of its plan to return to profitabilty by 1998, an Apple spokesman said Friday. The fourth-biggest U.S. maker of personal computers also is taking a closer look at unprofitable product lines with an eye at discontinuing them, said David Harrah, Apple's corporate spokesman. As first reported in USA Today, the upcoming round of job cuts is part of Apple's plan to slash up to 20 percent of its costs to compensate for falling revenue. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., has not yet determined how many it will fire, Harrah said. Apple dismissed about 1,300 people last year as part of a broad corporate restructuring programme. Earlier this month the company said it would launch another restructuring programme aimed at cutting another $400 million in costs. At the time Apple executives said additional layoffs were possible but they provided few details. On Friday, Harrah confirmed layoffs will be part of the plan. ""There will be layoffs as part of a larger restructuring,"" Harrah said. ""We are taking a look at the entire business"" including the possibility of discontinuing lines such as the handheld Newton computer and the Pippin home entertainment console. Abandoning Newton and Pippin would mark a return to Apple's core business of focusing on traditional PC products rather than other forms of technology. It would also signal a departure from the vision of former Apple Chief Executive John Sculley who pushed for the Newton before he was fired in 1993. The move comes weeks after Apple reported a fiscal first quarter loss of $120 million on a sharp decline in sales. The struggling computer maker recently warned it does not expect to return to profitability until September, six months later than originally scheduled. Apple's troubles are a setback to Chairman Gilbert Amelio's plan to stanch Apple's losses by 1997. Under his plan, Apple aims to reduce its costs so it can break even at $8 billion in annual sales. Apple executives have blamed weaker-than-expected sales of the company's consumer-oriented personal computers for the decline in revenues. To bolster sales, Apple on Friday said it cut price cuts on many of its product lines by as much as 27 percent. The company slashed prices of its consumer-oriented Performa machines, its high-end Power Macintoshes and its business-oriented Workgroup Servers. For example, the price of the Power Macintosh 9500/200, a machine popular with graphic artists, was slashed to about $3,200 from $4,200. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Software giant Microsoft Corp. Thursday unveiled the highly anticipated version of its next-generation software for office computers, called Office 97. Office 97 -- a package of software that includes popular programmes such as Microsoft Word for word processing, the Excel spreadsheet programme, Access database software and the PowerPoint presentation programme -- has many new features, including document collaboration and the ability to jump seamlessly from a document or spreadsheet to the Internet. ""Office is a centrepiece of Microsoft's Internet strategy,"" Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said at a New York news conference. The software giant, which has 55 million users of Microsoft Office applications, said it had already received advance orders from nearly 10,000 retail outlets for Office 97. The software became available in stores Thursday. The company said 3 million copies had been sold through corporate licensing agreements. Industry analysts noted, however, that many large business users of Microsoft's Office software have not upgraded to the Windows 95 or Windows NT operating systems required by Office 97. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said more than 80 percent of the improvements in Office were a result of customer feedback. ""Our investments in understanding the needs of customers and our continued ability to deliver exciting enhancements are the cornerstone of Office's ongoing success,"" Gates said. Gates launched the software at a media event at New York's Lincoln Centre. Microsoft dominates the office suite category of software, with a 90 percent market share, according to International Data Corp., a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass. But it faces increasingly aggressive competition from Canada's Corel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus unit and its SmartSuite software. Corel, which uses WordPerfect word-processing software as the core of its office software, made a significant dent in Microsoft's retail market share in the second half of last year, according to industry analysts. ""While SmartSuite and Corel are eating away at things like price and Internet features, Microsoft's message to corporations is, 'Guys, it's the ease of use and the cost of ownership,'"" said Eric Brown, a Forrester Research analyst. Microsoft said with some of its new features in Office 97, such as the Office Assistant, users can easily get answers from a built-in software ""guru"" without burdening their information systems managers. Tools such as Network Installation Wizard, Office Resource Kit and others make it easier for information system managers to install and manage the software. ""I'd not be surprised if we reduced the cost of ownership by one-third to one-half,"" said Dennis Tevlin, Microsoft's director of product marketing, desktop applications. Since Sun Microsystems Inc., International Business Machines Corp., and others have introduced lower-cost network computers, one feature they have touted is the low cost of ownership of these new devices vs. the higher cost of maintaining PCs and their hefty software. Office is a huge cash generator for Microsoft. Its desktop applications group, which is dominated by Office, is expected to bring in about $5 billion of the company's fiscal 1997 revenues, which are estimated at slightly over $10 billion, according to Wall Street analysts. The standard edition of Office 97 for upgrades from earlier versions of the software has an estimated retail price of $209. It will sell for $249 for upgrading from non-Microsoft suites and $499 for new users. One new component in Office 97 is called Microsoft Outlook, a desktop information manager. Outlook helps users manage information, track documents and communicate. By integrating e-mail, scheduling, contact management, task management and a module for tracking documents and events, Outlook acts as a central ""hub"" for Office 97. Gates said one of his favourite features of Outlook is its e-mail filtering capability, which enables him to immediately read and answer important e-mail amid the flood of e-mail messages he receives daily from around the world. Other features include Internet technologies that make it easy for users to create ""hyperlinks"" linking their documents to a World Wide Web site, for example. Users can also search Office and Web-style documents on a corporate network and they can navigate documents using the familiar tools of a Web browser. ""We like to call this activating the Web,"" Tevlin said. ""1996 was the year of the lots of Internet infrastructure products. Office 97 is the first in this new wave of Web applications."" Microsoft's stock gained $1.375 to $86 on Nasdaq. ","TheresePoletti"
"Australian Internet service provider OzEmail Ltd on Thursday launched long-distance telephone calls over the Internet at a quarter the cost charged by existing Australian phone companies Telstra Corp and Optus. OzEmail, which is based in Sydney but listed on the technology-heavy NASDAQ market in the United States, said users do not need a personal computer for the new service. A call can be made from any telephone by dialling a number which then connects the call to the Internet and the destination. The new service, called a world first by OzEmail, was launched with former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating making the first call to Mark Roberts, telecommunications analyst at Montgomery Securities in the United States. ""Today, I am pleased to launch what I am confident will become one of the major means by which we will communicate with the rest of the world,"" Keating told reporters at the launch. Keating described the call's quality as being equal to or better than a call on a cellular phone. Under OzEmail's new service, calls to the U.S. and Britain would cost A$21 (US$27) per hour compared with about A$77 charged by Telstra and Optus. ""Calls over the Internet are less expensive because of the superior bandwidth utilisation of the Internet as compared to the traditional technology employed by telephone companies,"" OzEmail chief executive Sean Howard told reporters. The service would initially be exclusive to OzEmail's 100,000-plus Internet customers, who would only be able to place long-distance calls within Australia and to New Zealand, the United States and Britain in the early stages, Howard said. After two months the service would be made available to the public with the residential market targeted first, Howard said. The reach of its calls will then be expanded to Japan, Hong Kong and Italy, with Taiwan and another Asian country a possibility. Calls can only be made from Australia or by Australians travelling overseas, as regulations prevented OzEmail from providing the service to citizens of other countries. Keating said: ""It opens up a new market, particularly for low-income families that were previously excluded from the long-distance market because of the high cost."" Under Keating's term as prime minister, which ended in March 1996, Australia started deregulating its telecommunications industry, which will become fully deregulated on July 1, 1997. The current coalition government of Prime Minister John Howard is also planning to sell a third of state-owned Telstra, which could raise an estimated A$8.0 billion (US$6.2 billion). Any valuation on Telstra could be affected by the impact of cheaper telephone calls over the Internet, Keating said. ""This might even lower the valuation of Telstra, but I don't have to worry about that anymore,"" a smiling Keating said. Australian telecommunications analysts agreed that cheaper telephone service via the Internet would be a threat to both Telstra and Optus, which also plans a share-market float. ""Local telephony over the Internet has been a threat to the carrier market for some time and that is why Telstra and Optus are trying to get involved in the Internet and carry more Internet traffic,"" one Sydney-based telecoms analyst said. ""I don't think they (Telstra and Optus) will be encouraging local calls over the Internet,"" the analyst said. (A$1 = US$.775) ","KevinMorrison"
"Option Care Inc is comfortable with a Wall Street 1997 earnings estimate of $0.41 per share, compared to $0.33 per share before a one-time charge in 1996, said chief executive Erick Hanson. In an interview with Reuters, Hanson said the Bannockburn, Ill.-based home healthcare company is targeting annual revenue growth of 25 to 30 percent. ""We have a pretty good pipeline and a plan to be able to achieve that,"" he said. The company's thinly traded shares were unchanged at 5-5/8 late Wednesday. Management owns 70 percent of the stock.   Started in California as a home infusion services franchiser, Option Care was bought in 1991 by healthcare entrepreneur and venture capitalist John Kapoor, who took it public the following year. Kapoor remains chairman and owns 60 percent of the company. Hanson came aboard two years ago. Option Care and its franchisees operate 190 facilities in 39 states, with heavy concentrations in California, Georgia, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania. Home healthcare firms sell services and products to people with cancer, AIDS and other medical disorders requiring intravenous drug treatment or other relatively complex care.   As the managed care revolution has driven more patients out of expensive hospital beds, home healthcare has emerged as a hot industry. Nursing home companies, hospitals, HMOs and others are rushing to get into it, chiefly by acquiring home healthcare specialty firms such as Option Care. Amidst this rapid consolidation, Option Care stands out as the largest remaining pure play in the market for home infusion therapy, or intravenous medication administration. The company is diversifying into related home healthcare businesses, however, so that it will eventually resemble more broadly based home healthcare firms, Hanson said.   Large, diversified competitors include Apria Healthcare Group Inc and Olsten Corp, Hanson said. Option Care is going about its transition by acquiring its better home infusion franchises and smaller independent firms, as well as home nursing agencies, medical equipment sellers and respiratory therapy service providers. Option Care did 12 acquisitions in 1996 -- five franchises, seven independents. ""Our strategy is to buy strong franchises in targeted regions, then surround them with complementary services through acquisitions,"" Hanson said. ""Our objective is to be fully integrated by the end of 1999 in at least seven states.""   ""What we're saying is that with one phone call, one stop, we can provide any type of home care,"" Hanson said. Option Care recently received a $30 million credit line from a group of banks. ""We're investigating during the next 12 to 18 months the possibility of putting more equity in play,"" Hanson said, adding that Kapoor is ""very much open to reducing his position, but he also doesn't want to walk away from it because he thinks it's a good place for his money.""

"(Corrects by deleting the fourth paragraph, so that the story will reflect that at no point did Giering blame AT&amp;T for tax issues that NCR faces as an independent company.) NCR Corp eked out a small profit in the fourth quarter of 1996 and saw healthy gains in year-over-year profit margins but hopes of matching computer industry growth rates remain a long way off, executives said. In a conference call with analysts and a phone interview after the call, NCR Chief Financial Officer John Giering said profits are weighed down by a whopping 75 percent tax rate. Giering said NCR was unlikely to bring its tax levels down to resemble industry norms of 35 to 40 percent before 1999.  He said his goal was to bring the company's U.S. operations to breakeven in 1997 in terms of profitablity. NCR is already profitable in its overseas operations, which accounted for half of its $7 billion in 1996 revenues. Besides slashing the company's tax rate, the NCR executive said the company's primary goal was to see a 9 to 12 percent growth rate from core operations over the next several years. Giering said he expected NCR to reach gross profit margins in the mid-30 percent range within three years.   In 1996 results released earlier Tuesday, gross margins for the year rose to 28.1 percent from 1995's 21.8 percent. Giering said profits remain small but tax liabilities are very large, hence the high effective rate. AT&amp;T absorbed much of the potential benefit from operating loss carry-forwards when NCR was still a subsidiary, he said. On balance, AT&amp;T relieved NCR of more than $3 billion in net losses since 1993, leaving NCR's balance sheet remarkably clean prior to its spin-off as a separate company this month. NCR said it ended 1996 with $1.2 billion in cash and debt of only $76 billion.   ""Right now (the tax rate) is in the 75 percent range,"" Giering told Reuters, ""I look at this as a 1997 phenonmon."" He estimated that the tax rate would come down to roughly 50 percent in 1998 on the way to the 35 to 40 percent level expected in 1999. ""Clearly we need to have more income in the U.S. to turn that number around,"" Giering said. The company may be aided in its goal of balancing the contribution of its U.S. and international operations by trends in top-line revenue growth.   Giering told analysts that the 1996 revenues for core businesses, excluding mass-market PCs and the entry level server businesses it is exiting, grew 9 percent in the Americas, but declined one percent in Europe and 3 percent in the Asia/Pacific region. NCR does not break out its revenues in dollar terms. The CFO said his primary goals was to ensure that ""international operations are really paying their full share in terms of all the costs incurred on their on behalf.""   He said one of the anomalies NCR is working hard to reconcile is that many of its corporate functions are domiciled in the United States, which made sense as a unit of AT&amp;T but now hurts NCR as a standalone entity at tax-time. Deep concern about NCR's financial prospects commbined with the company's insecure position in a computer industry that refuses to stand still has lead Wall Street analysts to be deeply leery of the stock since its public debut. Of the two analysts following the stock, one of them, Smith Barney's Shao Wang maintains a neutral rating. In an an unusual move on a neutral rated stock, Wang set a target price of $28 on the stock, well below its current price of $38-3/4. Nonetheless, on the strength of its ongoing turnaround, its limited fourth quarter profits and rising profit margins, NCR stock gained 3-1/8 on Tuesday. -- E.

"There will be many more places to hang your hat in cyberspace soon, thanks to a plan adopted by the Internet Society and a host of other groups, the society announced Tuesday. The group, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, said the plan would provide seven new top-level domains, the last three letters at the end of every electronic mail or Web site address. Computer maker Digital Equipment Corp., telecommunications company MCI Communications Corp. and UUNET Technologies Inc., a unit of Worldcom Inc., endorsed the plan, first unveiled in February, the society said. The plan also has been endorsed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards operating under a charter from the society and the Federal Network Council. The International Telecommunications Union, World Intellectual Property Organization and International Trademark Association backed the plan as well, the society said. Under the plan, new domain names such as ""firm,"" ""arts,"" and ""web"" will be added to the existing top-level domains such as ""com,"" ""net,"" and ""org"" starting in the third quarter of 1997, the society said. The plan establishes an arbitration and mediation procedure for resolving disputes over names, such as when a trademarked name is used in an Internet address. Last year, for example, toymaker Hasbro Inc. won a lawsuit to regain control of the address ""candyland.com,"" which was being used for an adult Web site with nude photographs. But more complex disputes arise when both parties may have a legitimate claim to an address name. ""Responsible self-governance is the key factor in assuring that the Internet will reach its fullest potential,"" Internet Society President Donald Heath said. Although other groups have tried to establish alternate domain names, they have not succeeded in persuading the vast majority of Internet service providers to add their new names to the computers that route information across the network. The Internet Society plan met the needs of major providers. ""The Internet is growing up rapidly and it is vital that the processes, procedures and policies that define its adminstration be sound, stable and sustainable in an international setting,"" MCI Senior Vice President Vincent Cerf said. MCI is a top operator of the Internet's backbone network. Currently, one company, Network Solutions Inc., registers addresses under most existing top-level domains under a contract with the National Science Foundation. Under the plan, up to 28 new registration agents will be chosen in a process overseen by the Big Six accounting firm Arthur Andersen. But Network Solutions Senior Vice President Don Telage said having so many registrars would create chaos on the Net. ""This plan risks the stability of the Internet,"" he said. The current system functions ""pretty well"" without international arbitration procedures, Telage said, noting his company has registered 1.2 million addresses and been sued only 26 times. Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions will come out with its own plan soon for reforming the domain name registration system, Telage added. While Network Solutions charges $100 for a two-year registration, the new firms will be free to compete on price. All names will be maintained in a central, shared database. Once Network Solution's contract with the National Science Foundation expires, the top-level domains it registers will be opened to all the other registry agents. A broad range of Internet companies and organizations will gather in Geneva at the end of April to add their formal endorsements on a memorandum of understanding, Heath said. ","AaronPressman"
"Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) said on Tuesday it would probe French insurer Axa-UAP's move into China, insisting it must hand ownership of Asian businesses to its Australian subsidiary. ""The board will critically examine the matter,"" a FIRB spokesman told Reuters by telephone from Canberra. ""It's a major matter -- absolutely,"" he added. Axa-UAP said last week Chinese authorities had given it the green light to sell life insurance in China.   The announcement hardly mentioned Axa-UAP's 51 percent owned Australian-based subsidiary, life office National Mutual Holdings Ltd, which is the Axa group's Asian arm. National Mutual, which had separately applied for a licence to operate in China, has said it is not clear what role, ""if any"", the Australian company will play in Axa's China business. When Axa bought 51 percent of National Mutual in 1995, the Australian government agreed to the foreign investment on the condition the parent make National Mutual its Asian arm.   The government's FIRB approved the foreign investment provided Axa ""transferred its existing life insurance interests to National Mututal Holdings"" and pursue ""its Asia Pacific life insurance business strategy through that company"". Insurance analysts have speculated Axa would retain ownership of the potentially lucrative China business, but would pay National Mutual's 69-percent subsidiary, Hong Kong-based National Mutual Asia, to manage it. But the FIRB spokesman said the board, in approving Axa's investment in National Mutual, cleary intended for Axa to hand ownership of its Asian businesses to the Australian company.   ""It means ownership,"" the spokesman said. FIRB will seek dialogue with both Axa and National Mutual in order to examine how the China business will be run, he said. Ultimately, if the conditions of Axa's investment in National Mutual were found to be breached, the government could move to enforce those conditions, he added.

"Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday its U.S. light vehicle sales fell 2.2 percent in November as a steep drop in car sales offset gains in trucks, capping off a disappointing month for the industry. Earlier this week General Motors Corp. reported a 12 percent drop in November sales, while Chrylser Corp. reported a 1.4 percent increase. Ford said it sold 290,774 cars and light trucks, compared with 297,362 a year earlier. Domestic car sales fell 11.3 percent to 52,101 units, while light truck sales rose 5.7 percent to 175,606. Ford's import car sales fell 48.2 percent to 1,597. ""The retail market's shift from cars to light trucks not only has continued, but is gaining momentum as the year progresses,"" said Robert Rewey, Ford group vice president of sales and marketing. Ford's combined Explorer, Mountaineer and Expedition sport utility vehicle sales rose 38 percent to 55,343 units. Rewey added that Ford planned to ease shortages of its four-wheel-drive vehicles by adding new component capacity in the first quarter of 1997. But November sales of every Ford car line, except the Taurus mid-size sedan, declined from the year-ago period. Taurus sales rose 9 percent to 31,017, enough to preserve the car's lead over the Honda Accord in the perennial duel for the best-selling car in the United States. So far this year, Americans have purchased or leased 363,077 Tauruses vs. 353,328 Accords and 335,906 Toyota Camrys. Ford's sales brought total industry U.S. car and light truck sales for November to 1,125,582 vehicles, down 1.6 percent from the 1,144,448 units sold a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for the month was 14.9 million units, compared with 14.8 million units a year earlier, and 14.9 million units for the month of October. The rate is calculated with seasonal factors supplied by the Commerce Department. General Motors on Tuesday reported a 12 percent drop in November sales, fueled by strikes and model changeovers, while Chrylser reported a 1.4 percent increase in sales. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. were the industry standouts, with sales gains of 19.6 percent and 15.5 percent, respectively. Analysts said the lackluster November results for Detroit's Big Three automakers did not signal the start of a downturn in the U.S. vehicle market. ""I think one of the problems in November was that you had Thanksgiving late in the month, with only two selling days after it, compared to six last year,"" said Smith Barney auto analyst David Healy in New York. ""December seems to have gotten off to a good start, so I think we'er going to have a good close to the year,"" he said. For the first 11 months of 1996, automakers sold 14,010,647 light vehicles, up 2.4 percent on a daily selling rate basis from the 13,590,795 sold a year earlier. Analysts predicted that the year-end total will be about 15.1 million to 15.2 million vehicles. Automakers sold 486,407 North American-built cars in the United States in November, down 9.7 percent from a year ago. Domestic truck sales totaled 494,166 during November, up 5.6 percent from a year earlier. ","DavidLawder"
"China published on Saturday a list of anti-dumping rules to protect local companies from unfair foreign competition. Chinese economists said the rules would help domestic companies, many of them targets of similar dumping claims overseas, protect their share of the domestic market. They also said the move appeared to be aimed at giving a legal framework to protection from unfair competition and clarifying procedures for its use. ""Many Chinese companies are unable to compete in the face of unfair trade practices,"" economist Cheng Xiusheng of the State Council (cabinet) development research centre told Reuters. ""Many other countries have imposed anti-dumping duties against Chinese products and China needs a system to regulate its own market and protect its companies,"" he said. The rules, published in the official People's Daily, give the government the right to determine whether imported goods are aided by official subsidies and impose anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. Cash guarantees can be demanded to ensure payment. Prices in the exporting country or third countries will be used to determine a fair price for goods in dispute and set a countervailing duty. The rules also provide guidelines for domestic companies to file complaints about unfair competition and set a maximum length of 12 months for an investigation. Special cases are allowed to take 18 months. The rules also empower the state to take retaliatory measures against countries that impose ""discriminatory"" countervailing duties against Chinese goods. Beijing's official media have said the dumping of foreign goods on the domestic market had cost China some 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) a year and had caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Many domestic manufacturers were pressuring the government to take steps to offset these policies, newspapers have said. Other economists said China was trying to codify the protection of its industries and bring its trade policies more in line with international practice. They added that as China sought to join the World Trade Organisation it was being forced to make its polices more transparent. ","WilliamKazer"
"Shares in French resorts company Club Mediterranee jumped almost 20 percent on Monday as investors welcomed the appointment of the head of Euro Disney to the ailing holidays group. Club Med announced last Friday it was replacing its chairman Serge Trigano with Philippe Bourguignon, head of the Disneyland Paris theme park, and surprised the market with a net loss for the 1995-96 year of 743 million francs ($131.3 million). ""Bourguignon knows the business well. He has credibility...he is probably one of the best guys to choose,"" analyst Thibaut Simonnet at broker Ferri said. Bouguignon is credited with the turnround in the last two years of Disneyland Paris, which suffered initial heavy losses after opening in 1992 to hostile French media reports and an indifferent public. Club Med traded up 20 percent to 427 francs, on volume of 956,611 shares at 1152 GMT, while the market was up 0.43 percent. Bourguignon, who takes up the new post in March, has 14 years' experience at hotels group Accor and gained valuable experience from Euro Disney, Simonnet said. Bouguignon's job at the theme park was probably made easier by the fact that Walt Disney Co held 39 percent of Euro Disney. Simonnet forecast a pretax pre-exceptional profit for Club Med in 1996-97 of 200 million francs and held his ""buy"" recommendation on the company. That forecast still represented a weak operating margin of 2.5 percent on annual turnover of eight billion francs. Another French brokerage, Oddo, upgraded the stock to ""overweight"" from ""underweight"" and pointed out that Bourguignon had managed to triple gross operating profit at Euro Disney in three years and boosted sales by a fifth. Oddo upgraded its forecast earnings per share for 1996-97 to 11.1 francs from a previous estimated 12.3 francs, and 22.7 francs for 1997/98 from 18.5. Bourguignon steps in at an opportune time as Club Med has set aside 820 million francs in restructuring provisions to pay for the closure of seven holiday villages and 100 head office job losses. The provisions will make it easier for Club Med to return to profit in 1997, analysts said. It is simplifying its marketing by dropping the mid-range ""Trident"" product and offering only the Club Med at the upper end of the market and Club Aquarius at the lower segment. It stands to make some money from the planned sale of a minority stake in an Italian business but will not get anything from disposing of its loss-making cruise liners. The company still enjoys a strong brand and has a strong financial structure, with an acceptable debt/equity ratio of 60 percent. The expiry of a cross-shareholding pact means the company is open to outsider investors. What remains to be seen is how the employees will react to the arrival of Bourguignon as a professional manager, in the place of Trigano, whose family founded the company and ran it as a family business even though it no longer owned Club Med.

"Qantas Airways Ltd is expected to fly slightly above its prospectus net profit forecast of A$237 million for the year to June 30, 1996 but analysts said 1996/97 results could hit some turbulence over current wage talks. Australian aviation analysts expect Qantas to report an annual net profit before abnormals of between A$237 million and A$249 million. The airline is expected to pay a second half dividend of 13 cents, making a total of 16.5 for the year.   Analysts said the Qantas result would be helped by lower costs, on which the airline has focussed since it became a publicly-owned company in July 1995. ""We have got an official figure of A$237 (million), but I really expect it to be around the A$240 to A$245 million mark and that would be largely driven by the cash flow being steered towards paying off debt,"" a Melbourne analyst said. ANZ McCaughan aviation analyst Yasmin Allen expects Qantas to report a profit of A$237 million for 1995/96. ""I would not be surprised to see it come in above that,"" Allen told Reuters.   Another Melbourne-based aviation analyst forecast Qantas to report a net profit right on the prospectus forecast of A$237 million while one Sydney-based analyst forecast a net profit before abnormals of A$239.1 million for the year. ""They have done well on the cost reduction side and they have seen the market grow, but they have lost market share, so add all that up and I think they will come out about square,"" the second Melbourne-based analyst said. Last week the Department of Transport released data showing that Qantas, including wholly-owned Australia Asia Airlines, had a 37.9 percent international market share in April.   Qantas, which is 25 percent owned by British Airways Plc, forecast in its 1995 prospectus that its international market share would be 41.1 percent for the June 30, 1996 year. Qantas, known as the 'flying Kangaroo' estimated a one percentage point variation from this forecast would affect the bottom line profit by A$48 million. However, analysts said they were more interested in comments about Qantas' outlook for the 1996/97 year, as costs may increase, arising from current wage talks, renewed domestic competition, and continued pressure on international routes.   Qantas has offered an eight percent pay rise over two years over two years on condition that productivity reforms are implemented, but unions want productivity gains to be rewarded by a wage rise over and above the eight percent offer. Qantas shares took a dive to a record low of A$1.87 on July 24 as the market got the jitters that management had conceded to union pressure and award a wage rise above eight percent. The unions initially made a claim for two consecutive annual wage rises of 10 percent but last month, Qantas chief executive James Strong said this claim would wipe out the airline's profit if successful.   Qantas shares have now moved back to familiar territory and on Tuesday were trading at A$2.17. Analysts expect Qantas to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$260 million to A$273 million for 1996/97, but some analysts said they would be ready to mark down these numbers if there were some very negative comments from Qantas. They said the planned purchase by Air New Zealand Ltd of a 50 percent stake in local airline Ansett Airlines Ltd may pressure the 1996/97 results   ""People have known what 96 will look like but 97 is going to be a different story for a whole mix of things and there should also be some impact from a combined Ansett/Air New Zealand when that starts to happen later this year,"" the Sydney analyst said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373 1800 ","KevinMorrison"
"The top executives of Conrail Inc., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. met Friday in a critical session aimed at resolving a stalemate in the three-month takeover battle for Philadelphia-based Conrail. The three companies declined to comment on the session, but hinted that future meetings could be forthcoming. ""Conrail, CSX and Norfolk Southern have concluded their meeting and have agreed that no further details on this meeting or timing of future meetings will be announced,"" the railroads said in a joint statement. The long-awaited meeting between chief executives David LeVan of Conrail, John Snow of CSX and David Goode of Norfolk Southern is viewed as critical to railroad consolidation on the East Coast. Conrail has rejected a $10.3 billion cash offer from Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern in favour of a $9.6 billion cash and stock transaction with Richmond, Va.-based CSX. The deal ran into trouble earlier this month when Conrail shareholders defeated a key provision that would have permitted the planned merger with CSX to move forward. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern is now in the process of buying 9.9 percent of Conrail's stock. The three executives agreed last week to hold a meeting to discuss competitive issues in the railroad industry. Conrail and CSX have stressed they are committed to their transaction and Norfolk Southern has said it would not accept any resolution that would value Conrail at less than its $115 per share offer. Wall Street analysts expressed cautious optimism about the meeting, but warned that any end to the stalemate would be difficult and lengthy. On Wednesday, Goode also said that negotiations would likely be tough. ""We would suggest it is the first of many meetings, but it's a step in the right direction,"" said Thomas Galvin of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, noting that East Coast railroad consolidation has been discussed for the past 10 years. Separately, the head of the federal agency that oversees railroads, reiterated her support of private sector negotiations to resolve competitive access issues in railroad mergers. ""What history has shown us is that private sector negotiations do result in the benefit to the parties involved and the public at large,"" said Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, in a speech at the National Mining Association's annual transportation conference being held in Florida. Although Morgan did not address the Conrail case specifically, she said the board would look to preserve competition in the nation's rail network. Shares of Conrail dipped 12.5 cents to $107.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock also fell 12.5 cents to $48.50 and Norfolk Southern shares fell 50 cents to $88.625, also on NYSE.

"Advanced Micro Devices Inc., in a bid to take on computer chip giant Intel Corp.,  on Wednesday began shipping its K6 microprocessor. AMD, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said its K6 microprocessor works faster than Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro chip, is 25 percent cheaper than comparable Intel offerings and is easier to design a PC around. For the first time in its corporate history, AMD is a strong alternative for the latest technology to Intel, the world's biggest semiconductor company, said Jerry Sanders, AMD's chairman. ""It's the good guys vs. the bad guys,"" Sanders said in a presentation to investors and reporters. ""It's the Return of the Jedi. We're the Jedi."" AMD makes microprocessors, the chips that handle the main calculations of a personal computer. Until now, AMD's chips have been about three years behind in technology from what Intel has offered. The K6, using technology gained from the 1995 acquisition of chip designer Nexgen Inc., crunches numbers just as fast or slightly faster than Intel's Pentium, analysts said. With the K6, AMD hopes to land several big computer companies as customers. ""There is a growing perception that the Intel monoply is getting broken up,"" said Krishna Shankar, semiconductor analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ""If I were a PC maker I would want two healthy competitors."" No PC manufacturer, however, has yet committed to using the K6 in its machines. At the AMD presentation, Sanders did not name any K6 customers, as some analysts had expected. Sanders said PC makers will begin to announce K6-based machines in the next 60 days. ""The single most important task for us right now is to convince the biggest PC players in the top tiers,"" he said. AMD's stock fell 12.5 cents to $39.50 and was the most active on the New York Stock Exchange. Intel fell $2.31 to $137 on Nasdaq. Even though AMD did not name any customers, most analysts expect the company to ship at least 2 million K6 chips by the end of the year. Based largely on the demand for the K6, the worldwide market for non-Intel microprocessors will triple in 1997 to $2.4 billion from $722 million in 1996, market researcher Dataquest said.

"Hyatt Hotels Corp. said Monday it will spend $1 billion over the next three years to acquire 20 to 30 hotels, rapidly accelerating its expansion programme. Target properties will be upscale three- to five-star hotels and resorts in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean over a three-year period, said Hyatt, which is owned by Chicago's Pritzker family. The company already has made two deals which it says are typical of the expansion plan. Last Friday, a Hyatt affiliate purchased the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, which Hyatt has managed since 1973, for $125 million plus the assumption of $5 million in debt, the company said. On Friday, Chicago-based Hyatt will take over management of the Hotel Nikko Atlanta after acquiring the hotel in partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Partners for $90 million. The hotel will be renamed the Grand Hyatt Atlanta. Hyatt, which operates 176 Hyatt hotels and resorts around the world, purchased 12 hotels in the past three years. The more aggressive acquisition stance was seen by some as a response to acqusition plans by Hyatt's competitors. ""Hyatt is probably doing this to be defensive,"" said Burland East, analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago, noting that the move comes as other hoteliers, including Host Marriott Corp. and Hilton Hotels Corp., are looking to expand. Hyatt's plan was made easier by a recent reorganization of some Pritzker family holdings. The family recently formed Hyatt Equities L.L.C., a real estate acquisition company that consolidates a number of the family's hotel real estate interests into one company, Hyatt said. Hyatt Equities was created to capitalise on the equity value of the Pritzkers' hotel portfolio, allowing the company to borrow against a collection of assets instead of individual assets at more favourable interest rates. ""Hyatt Equities provides an additional vehicle through which we will grow our family's interest in Hyatt hotel real estate, enabling Hyatt to acquire hotels already managed by Hyatt as well as hotels currently managed by other hotel companies,"" Nicholas Pritzker, president of Hyatt Development and Hyatt Equities, said in a news release. Hyatt Equities debt will be rated by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, and Hyatt's investment bankers anticipate strong investment-grade ratings Hyatt said. Hyatt said that, as a private company, Hyatt Equities is able to use a broader set of transaction structures than is typically available to public companies, real estate investment trusts or acquisition funds. Among real estate investment trusts that could wind up competing with Hyatt for upscale properties are Dallas-based Patriot American Hospitality Inc. and Phoenix-based Starwood Lodging Trust, East said. ""At the margins, 30 hotels is meaningful,"" East said of the impact of Hyatt's plan on the hotel landscape. ""Is it earth-shattering? No."" ","BradDorfman"
"Within a few years, some two million severely handicapped people in Europe could communicate with each other over the global Internet using a special eye-movement control to run a personal computer. A small French team of researchers on Thursday showed the latest prototype of an Apple Macintosh computer that reacts to the subtle movements of the eye. This system, which follows a clinical test with 30 people in France to evaluate a word processor commanded by eye movement, opens the world of multimedia to the handicapped and will allow them to entertain themselves with electronic books, compact discs or computer games. ""Severely handicapped people are mainly young people in the 15 to 31 years category who have had a road accident. They have not always been handicapped, they still have all their intellectual facilities and they have a very long life expectancy,"" said Bernard de Groc of social researchers Delta 7. Doctor Philippe Thoumie, who coordinated clinical tests in three hospitals in France this year, said that of the 30 people that had tried to use it, 22 had managed to do so with success. ""The main advantage of this system is that it is not a heavy system that makes a patient feel bad. They do not want to be robocops with special helmets on or with wires all over them,"" he told a news conference. The idea of letting the handicapped, especially those that have lost control of their upper body functions and sometimes even their speech faculty, communicate through the use of a computer is not new. There are systems that let a person ""push"" buttons on a screen by means of a mounted headset with a laserbeam. Other systems let the alphabet pass by on a screen and the patient can indicate the right letter. Yet another system puts sensors on the patient's face. There are also mouse-based systems for people who have still some control over their hands. ""The difficult thing was to be able to track eye-movements with a fixed camera in a head which is not being kept still,"" said Jacques Charnier, a researcher of the INSERM institute in Lille who has been working on the system since 1990. The Deltavision system they developed allows the handicapped to use ordinary computers and standard software applications. For that they have to sit in front of a computer screen above which there is a small box. This box contains a small camera in the middle of a field of characters and symbols. The camera tracks the eye when the handicapped person looks at a character to write a sentence in a word processor programme, or to give commands to execute other programmes. Charnier said the system could be coupled to infrared sensors that can change the volume of a music system or the temperature in a room. It can be used to play compact discs, make recordings of telephone conversations, browse through an encylopaedia on CD-Rom or surf the Internet. Delta 7 will test four of the upgraded prototypes in 1997, at a cost of some 150,000 French francs ($28,460) each, and hopes to be able to start commercialising the system in 1998. Financed by mutual insurance fund Mutuelles de Mans and a French medical charity, Delta 7's Groc is not dreaming of the commercial value of the machine but of new applications. ""What we want to do next is to make a system than can be used by people who have to stay in bed,"" he said. ($1=5.270 French Franc) ","MarcelMichelson"
"China's sugar factories could ease their financial woes by taking advantage of Far East demand and exporting to Asian users but they are unlikely to be given the go-ahead soon, trade and industry sources said on Wednesday. Chinese producers, most of which are burdened by low prices and high debts, could earn $15-20 a tonne exporting white sugar to the region, a trader with a Western bank in Hong Kong said. Recent Indonesian purchases of Thai sugar had tightened regional supply, which could mean Asian buyers will have to look elsewhere for their sugar, he said. ""If you take the Thai white sugar out of the market, other importers will need to find a place for sugars, so you could find interest coming from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Philippines,"" he said. ""And that's when China will come in as a replacement,"" he said. But that wasn't likely to happen any time soon, an official of the China Sugar Association told Reuters. ""The international prices are not at a level we could be happy with,"" he said by telephone from Nanning, capital of Guangxi province where most of China's sugar is produced.   Traders in Hong Kong said the current premium on white sugar over raw was $70 a tonne, but Far Eastern white sugar had a further $20 because of the cheaper regional freight rates. The association source said the Chinese government had agreed to buy locally produced sugar for central reserves in the hope of shoring up prices still well below break-even point for the factories. These guaranteed sales would help factories, most of which had to repay bank loans at the end of the season, he said. Guangxi's sugar reserves currently held 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes, he said. The national figure was not available. Central reserve sugar would not be released on to the market before ex-factory prices hit 4,400 to 4,500 yuan per tonne, another trader in Hong Kong said. Wholesale prices had not moved above 3,800 yuan ($457) a tonne for two months, the sugar association source said, speaking anonymously. Breakeven point for factories was 4,000 yuan a tonne, he said. Domestic demand has been flat for the past year or so, the official said, so it was difficult to predict when prices would start to firm and factories could see some profit.   Traders said they hoped prices would firm once the harvest and crushing season finished in late March. Sugar prices had been expected to firm in the lead-up to the Lunar New Year holiday, China's premier annual festival when confectionary demand traditionally soars. This was not the case this year, said Asian traders just returned from their five-day break. Slack demand for the festival compounded on-going flat consumption of soft drinks, sweets, ice-cream and other sweet luxuries that has kept China's annual sugar demand figure to around eight million tonnes in recent years, a trader with a Chinese firm in Hong Kong said. He blamed China's sluggish economy. ""If people are watching their pennies, they are not going to want to spoil themselves."" Chinese sugar demand should pick up as the summer approaches, he said, but it will be six to eight weeks before the factories see higher than break-even prices. China's current sugar crop has been officially predicted at 6.6 million tonnes, a figure most traders polled by Reuters agreed on, though one put it closer to 6.3 million tonnes. Imports, which central authorities have said will be 690,000 tonnes in 1997, are not expected to begin before mid-year. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004 ","LynneO'Donnell"
"Tobacco to insurance group B.A.T Industries Plc reported a five percent rise in 1996 profits to 2.495 billion pounds ($4 billion) on Wednesday, hit by an exceptional charge of 160 million pounds for U.S. environmental claims against its Eagle Star insurance unit. Excluding the charge, profit rose by seven percent. Chairman Lord Cairns said in a statement B.A.T dismissed any liability for damages currently being claimed by smokers in a string of tobacco related lawsuits in the U.S. The company also said it kept an open mind on its corporate structure, but gave no news of any concrete plans. As well as disappointment over the exceptional insuarnce charge some analysts had hoped B.A.T would say more about the possible demerger of its tobacco and insurance arms. B.A.T shares, up 32 percent since November as its legal battles in the U.S. looked more promising, tumbled 20 pence to 530 pence in early trade. ""We continue to believe that B.A.T Industries itself has no potential liability in any U.S. tobacco litigation,"" Cairns said, adding that the tobacco industry was confident of winning the cases and does not intend to offer a settlement. However, Cairns said the company would be prepared to ""evaluate proposals from third parties to provide relief from all current and future suits, provided that they were in shareholders' interests"". Cairns said, ""Our twin goals are to improve the long term growth prospects of our business and to increase shareholder value. We continue to evaluate business oppurtunities and issues of corporate structure that will enable us to meet them."" B.A.T director of public affairs Michael Prideaux told Reuters the company was keeping an open mind. ""We were surprised by media reports that we had ruled out a demerger,"" said Prideaux. ""We are not convinced that simply doing the splits helps either business much, what we are saying however is we have an open mind."" The company has looked at several options for improving shareholder return over the last year, including merging its financial services arm, comprising mainly general and life insurance companies, with another insurer. Prideaux dismissed the idea of floating off the company's U.S. cigarette arm Brown &amp; Williamson as a way of ringfencing the rest of B.A.T from any potential payments to smokers in the United States. ""Tobacco is strategically managed as world wide business so simply floating off B&amp;W would be a classic way of destroying shareholder value because B&amp;W plays an integral part in developing U.S. international brands around the world,"" said Prideaux. ""If it became independent you would probably end up with separate sales networks."" B.A.T's tobacco business turned in a 7 percent overall improvement in local currency to 1.634 billion pounds with group volumes four percent ahead and world market share increasing to 12.8 percent from 12.4 percent. Trading profit from financial services grew by an underlying eight percent to 1.2 billion with strong performances from two insurers Farmers in the U.S. and Allied Dunbar in Britain. The company recommended an eight percent increase in the base dividend to 26.0p, with a further 3.5 pence to be paid as a foreign income dividend. ($ = 0.619 British Pounds) ","TimFarrand"
"CVS Corp., the nation's fifth-largest chain of drug stores, said Friday it will acquire rival Revco D.S. Inc. for $2.8 billion in stock and the assumption of $900 million of debt. The planned union will create the nation's second largest drug store chain, dominating the eastern half of the country. It will have about 4,000 stores and annual sales of $13 billion, making it the largest in terms of outlets and second-largest behind Walgreen Co. in terms of total sales. While the announcement did not state how many jobs might be eliminated in the merger, the companies said that Revco's Twinsburg, Ohio, headquarters would be phased out. Sources familiar with the companies said that most of the 1,000 people employed at the headquarters were likely to lose their jobs. CVS Chief Operating Officer Thomas Ryan did not dispute those estimates, saying ""it's unfortunate,"" but he said the company will retain about 98 percent of Revco employees. CVS said the new company, which will keep the name CVS, will be led by its existing senior management and retain the CVS headquarters in Woonsocket, R.I. Revco Chief Executive Officer Dwayne Hoven will leave the company after the merger is completed. ""He will stay through the transition. He is intently interested in seeing to it that his people in Twinsburg are well taken care of,"" a Revco spokeswoman said. The merger is the latest in the drugstore chain sector, which has seen intense consolidation in the past year. The transaction will solidify CVS's position in the sector and allow it to expand significantly. Analysts said the companies have little geographic overlap and the combination is not expected to generate significant antitrust concerns. CVS stores are located primarily in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions while Revco stores are mostly in Midwest and Southeast. The merger calls for CVS to pay the equivalent of $40.64 in its shares for each share of Revco, based on Thursday's closing stock prices. CVS stock closed Thursday at $44 a share and Revco at $38, both on the New York Stock Exchange, but moved higher Friday. Revco added $3.375 to close at $41.375 in heavy trading while CVS gained $3.125 to $47.125, both on the New York Stock Exchange. Ryan of CVS said the transaction would add to earnings slightly this year and would add another 10 cents to 15 cents per share in 1998. ""What we're trying to be is more than just a growth company -- a world-class healthcare retailer. And that's what I think this combination will do,"" he said in a telephone interview. Analysts agreed. ""It's a great deal for CVS. The structure (of the deal) is going to allow it to be additive to earnings immediately,"" Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research-Maxus Group said. ""(CVS and Revco) are the two most dominant market share players in the industry and market share is really the name of the game,"" he said. Both companies acknowledged last month that they were discussing a combination of their businesses. Ryan said that the two companies began holding discussions in October. Ryan said CVS also had considered an acquisition of Eckerd Corp., but decided that Revco was a better fit. J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which owns Thrift drug stores, announced a $3.3 billion acquisition of Eckerd in November. Two shareholders likely to prosper from the merger are Revco CEO Hoven and Revco co-Chairman Sam Zell. Zell's Chilmark Fund LP holds a 19.2 percent stake in Revco and Hoven also has large holdings in the company. CVS said the new company plans to open or relocate 300 stores a year after the merger is completed. Analysts said the CVS-Revco union likely marks at least a near-term end to big mergers in the industry, although dozens of small chains still exist and are expected to get scooped up or join forces with bigger operators. Revco had agreed in November, 1995, to merge with Rite Aid Corp. in a $1.8 billion deal, but that merger collapsed last April after federal and state regulators raised antitrust concerns. Analysts said the companies have little goeographic overlap, and the union of CVS and Revco was not expected to generate significant antitrust concerns. ""A number of companies in the sector are coming to us and asking us what they should do strategically,"" said Marty Murrer, managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which advised CVS in the Revco deal and has been a key player in the sector's biggest transactions. Arbor Drug Inc., Genovese Drug Stores Inc. and privately held Duane Reade Inc. have been cited as likely candidates to participate in the consolidation sweeping the sector. ","RobinSidel"
"Toronto's key stock index ended softer in light trading on Monday, depressed by weak gold shares and fears of a Canadian interest rate hike. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index eased 4.31 points to close at 5679.33, down more than 10 percent since its life-time high of 6348.02 on March 11. Turnover was thin with 63.6 million shares changing hands worth C$965.6 million ($689.7 million). The TSE was restrained on Monday by a weak Canadian dollar which prompted concerns that the Bank of Canada may have to raise Canadian rates to prop up the currency, said Dunnery Best, Midland Walwyn's director of private client investing. Canada's dollar closed at C$1.3994 (US$0.7145) on Monday after the central bank intervened to support the sagging unit. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recouped some of Friday's 148-point loss, rising 60.21 points to close at 6451.90 on Monday. Fears of rising U.S. interest rates, which dragged North American markets lower last week, appear to have subsided, Best said. ""Has it run its course? I would say largely,"" he said. Other stock analysts suggested the threat of higher U.S. rates is not over and they predicted the correction would resume. Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, nine weak groups were led by gold, consumer products and real estate. Gainers included media, oils and base metals. Declining stocks outnumbered advances 581 to 351 with 290 unchanged. Hot stocks included Ballard Power Systems Inc. which jumped 3.25 to 39.50 after German industrial group Daimler-Benz AG said it bought a 25 percent stake in Ballard. The two companies plan to jointly develop fuel cells for electric vehicles. Among gold stocks, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. slipped 0.05 to 2.45 on 5.6 million shares, the heaviest trader on the TSE. Golden Rule Resources Ltd. fell 0.65 to 5.15 in heavy dealings. ","LydiaZajc"
"A huge cheer erupted in the newsroom of the Seattle Times shortly after 12 noon Monday when Washington state's largest newspaper learned it had won its sixth Pulitzer prize. A few minutes later another cheer went up when the newspaper won its seventh. ""It was wild pandemonium,"" said business editor Rob Weisman. For any but the nation's largest newspapers it is virtually unheard of to win more than one Pulitzer in a year, but the Seattle Times this year won in two prestigious categories  -- investigative reporting and beat reporting. ""We had two very competitive candidates, but the odds against winning two in a single year are so astronomical there's simply no way you can get your hopes up for something like that,"" said executive editor Mike Fancher. With a daily circulation of 235,000, the Seattle Times barely ranks among the nation's 50 biggest newspapers. The Pulitzer judges cited the Times for its series exploring corruption in a federally subsidised housing programme for native Americans and for beat reporter Byron Acohido's investigation of rudder control problems on the Boeing 737, the world's most widely used airplane. Shortly after the series was published the Federal Aviation Administration called for inspection of all U.S.-based models for any possible jamming of rudder parts, and Boeing announced it was working on a modification. Throughout his investigation, Acohido encountered what Fancher called a ""very hostile reaction"" from Boeing, the region's dominant employer. At one point the company issued a statement saying it refused to cooperate with Acohido because ""we have lost all confidence that he is capable of objective reporting when it comes to Boeing."" ""In terms of access to Boeing they've treated me consistently, which means minimum access,"" Acohido said. ""There are other ways of getting information."" The Pulitzer was the second for Times reporter Eric Nalder, who was part of the investigative team that also included Deborah Nelson and Alex Tizon. Their report on inequities in subsidised Indian housing led to congressional hearings and proposals to change the law governing the programme. ""In both stories the immediate aftermath was that things changed, and that's what good journalism is about,"" Fancher said. Nalder also was part of the team that won the newspaper's last Pulitzer in 1990 for its coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. ","MartinWolk"
"A top executive of Tyco International Ltd on Monday vowed that the company would not pursue a hostile takeover of American Standard Cos Inc, which last month rejected its unsolicited merger offer. ""Tyco historically has not done hostile takeovers, and we are not going to do a hostile takeover here. We're off and doing other things. As far as we're concerned, it's past history,"" Senior Vice President David Brownell told Reuters in a telephone interview.   However, Brownell said Tyco would still welcome friendly talks with American Standard. ""If the American Standard management would like to speak with us, we would be happy to speak with them,"" he said. Brownell said that Tyco has not tried to contact American Standard since its December offer was rejected. American Standard earlier disclosed that it had received the offer from Tyco but had determined that it wanted to remain independent. It also said it did not plan to hold any discussions with Tyco. Tyco had offered $50 per share, or about $3.9 billion, for American Standard in a combination of stock and cash. Shares of American Standard, which had rallied more than 4 in early trade, were up 3-1/4 to 43-1/2 by midafternoon. Tyco shares were unchanged at 54-5/8. ","RobinSidel"
"Australian retailer Coles Myer Ltd is praying a cold, wet winter will cheer up the group's struggling apparel business and add new growth to annual profit. Chief executive Dennis Eck, speaking after Coles announced another firm rise in quarterly sales, said he remained cautious about the profit outlook for its three main apparel businesses. ""That (apparel) is the thing that most concerns us,"" Eck told Reuters on Thursday.   Earlier, Coles posted a 6.5 percent rise in sales revenue to A$4.559 billion for the quarter ended April 27, bringing total sales for the year to date to A$14.5 billion, up 5.7 percent. Coles' best-performing supermarkets division again led the result, recording a 12.3 percent jump in sales revenue for the quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago. The group's once-struggling merchandise group, especially its Kmart chain of stores, also improved, posting a 5.8 percent rise in sales revenue, including fatter profit margins at Kmart.   But sales at Coles' women's wear business, Katies, as well as its Target discount stores and its Myer Grace Bros department store chain, which both rely heavily on clothing sales, were all down. Eck said fashion sales depended on extremes of weather and that a wet, cold winter could help revive them. ""I'm hoping for cold and rain for 20 more days and that would be nice,"" he said. ""It's a nice cold rainy day and May is when you really sell through your winter."" A Sydney-based retail analyst agreed the weather had helped prolong weakness in Coles apparel sales.   ""One of the reasons why this quarter has been so bad (for apparel) is this incredible Indian summer we have been having, and fashion needs extremes of weather,"" he told Reuters. Some economists have argued apparel sales are the victim of a long-term shift in spending patterns, with entertainment and other consumer items competing for household incomes. But Eck defended Coles' apparel businesses and rejected a suggestion it sell Katies, its only speciality fashion business. ""If you take straight apparel as a category, it represents...no more than 16 percent of our business, including Katies,"" he said.   ""We are happy to be in that segment. We think we have a very good balance to the retail category that we sell, and we are not in the mood to make short-term decisions on cyclical events. ""When apparel gets good again, it will be very nice to own a specialty apparel business,"" Eck said.   Weak apparel sales were offset in the third quarter by strong sales from the supermarket and Kmart businesses, enabling Eck to stick to his forecast of steady second-half profits. ""We...(had) stated that we expected a similar percentage growth in the second-half profit after tax to that experienced in the first half, excluding property disposal profits and abnormals,"" Eck said in a statement. ""We are still of that view, subject to conditions remaining stable.""   Analysts are forecasting Coles to report, on average, a net profit before abnormals of A$326.7 million for the year to July 27, according to an April survey by Barceps forecasting service. Coles reported a pre-abnormal net profit of A$302 million in 1995/96. -- Melbourne bureau 61-3 9286-1421 ","MarkBendeich"
"A group of 28 computer and communications equipment makers -- missing a major modem manufacturer -- Wednesday announced a coalition to develop a common standard for a new generation of faster modems running at speeds up to 56 kilobits per second. Missing from the coalition was U.S. Robotics Corp., the industry's leading maker of consumer modems and the company credited with pioneering development of 56-kilobit modems, which began shipping its products earlier this week. U.S. Robotics and 3Com Corp. later announced that 3Com would buy U.S. Robotics in a deal valued at $6.6 billion. Faster modems will dramatically cut the time it takes to access a Web page or download software to a personal computer. The 56-kilobit-per-second speed would effectively double the speed of current 28.8-kilobit-per-second modems. The standards group is backed by other makers of modems and related products like Rockwell International Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc. and Motorola Inc. Backers of the industry standards effort, to be known as the Open 56 Forum, include leading data and telecommunications equipment makers, semiconductor suppliers and personal computer manufacturers. Twenty-eight companies in all signed up initially. In a conference call, supporters of the initiative said the forum would welcome the participation of any company willing to create interoperable 56-kilobit modems, including U.S. Robotics. ""We have approached U.S. Robotics directly ... to join,"" said David Mays, an official at Ascend Communications Inc., a driving force behind the effort to create a common standard. But before industry unification can be achieved, the standards-setting group may have to do a better job of encouraging key industry players to participate. A spokeswoman for U.S. Robotics said the company was first invited to join the Open 56K Forum less than one hour before the group's announcement was released Wednesday afternoon. Asked if U.S. Robotics would consider joining the Open 56K Forum, spokeswoman Sarah Powers responded, ""Definitely. We are actively seeking interoperability"" in the industry. She said Robotics was actively considering participating in the forum's first meeting, slated to be held March 27. While Robotics is the first to ship actual products, several vendors have said they plan to ship products in March. For example, Motorola introduced two 56-kilobit modems Wednesday, the Modemsurfr 56K and the Voicesurfr 56K. A spokeswoman said the modems will be available by mid-March. Until an industrywide standard is created, modems from each supplier will remain incompatible when communicating with modems offered by other suppliers. There is wide agreement within the industry that failure to agree on a common standard will create confusion among consumers, delaying acceptance of the higher-speed technology. ","EricAuchard"
"Beijing's parliament began the process on Wednesday of upgrading the southwestern city of Chongqing to become China's fourth municipality along with such cities as Beijing and Shanghai. Approval by the National People's Congress for the proposal will give Chongqing, a port on the Yangtze river in southwestern Sichuan province, the power to make its own decisions and handle its own finances without recourse to provincial authorities. Chinese sources said the decision had met opposition from provincial authorities in Sichuan, reluctant to lose control of the largest city and biggest industrial base in China's most populous province of more than 103 million inhabitants. With ratification of the proposal by China's rubber-stamp parliament virtually assured, Chongqing's area will expand to include two outlying cities and a prefecture, enlarging its population from 14 million to 30 million, the Xinhua news agency said. The decision will pave the way to accelerate relocation of about one million people who must move to make way for the huge lake that will be created after the Three Gorges dam blocks the Yangtze river, downstream from Chongqing, it said. A municipality has the same status as a province in China and falls under the direct authority of the central government. The other three municipalities are Beijing, Shanghai and the northern port city of Tianjin. Supporting the motion from the State Council, or cabinet, to upgrade Chongqing, Premier Li Peng told parliament the move would give the city control of the Three Gorges scheme, thus boosting management of the world's largest water control project. It would also help Chongqing to fuel economic development in western China, which has lagged far behind the boom in eastern coastal areas fuelled by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's market reforms, Li said. ""The upgrading of Chongqing will help promote the economic and social development of the southwest area and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,"" Li said. It would also ease pressure on the Sichuan provincial government in managing the huge population of the city. More than two-thirds of the estimated one million people who must be moved out of the way of the Three Gorges hydro power project would be resettled in Chongqing and its satellite cities of Wanxian, and Fuling, Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering told parliament. ""Chongqing municipality could handle the general administration of the relocation work,"" he told a parliament standing committee session that opened on Wednesday. In recent interviews, officials in Chongqing said the move would raise the political profile of the mega-city. As a municipality, Chongqing envisaged an economic boom that would narrow the gap between impoverished inland provinces in the west and their wealthy coastal cousins in the east, officials said. For years after the communists swept to power in 1949, Chongqing -- wartime capital of rival Nationalists from 1938 to 1945 -- took a back seat to Chengdu, capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan. Its elevation to municipality at the full session of parliament next month would end its backward role, officials said. ","JaneMacartney"
"The French government on Wednesday called off the controversial sale of electronics group Thomson SA in a major policy U-turn after weeks of staunchly defending its choice of buyer. It was the second privatisation to be halted in less than a month, after a decision to suspend the sale of state-owned bank CIC. It comes at a time when Prime Minister Alain Juppe, at a record low in opinion polls, is anxious to avoid another labour revolt following last month's truckers stoppage. The Finance Ministry said in a statement the suspension of the proposed Thomson sell-off to Lagardere Groupe was due to objections to the planned sale of the company's consumer electronics unit to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics. Several thousand workers of Thomson Multimedia marched in Paris and other cities on November 20 to protest against a sale to a booming Asian competitor, fearing for their jobs and working conditions. Staff were also enraged by Juppe telling parliament in October their hi-tech company was worthless. The prime minister said the company was ""worth not even a franc, it is worth 14 billion francs of debt."" Socialist opposition leaders attacked the government for opting to sell Thomson to Lagardere and not to rival bidder Alcatel Alsthom without awaiting the binding opinion of the independent Privatisation Commission. It was that body which told the government on Monday it could not agree with the sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo. The Finance Ministry said it still believed the sale of Thomson was vital because of President Jacques Chirac's wish to create a world-class electronics group, maintain employment and keep key technologies. The government said in October it had picked Lagardere because it was best for French defence interests and would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc (19 cents) after a 10.8 billion franc state capital injection. Lagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58-percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its own Matra Defense Espace. The Finance Ministry's surprise announcment came on the day the European Commission had been expected to give the green light to the deal. The ministry said the Privatisation Commission ""declared itself incapable of giving a favourable opinion to the Lagardere Groupe offer, because of the terms of Daewoo Electronics' purchase of Thomson Multimedia."" ""Consequently, the government has decided to suspend the privatisation process under way,"" it said. It added the companies could continue their discussions with the Privatisation Commission and the state would pursue talks with the European Commission about conditions for a capital increase, on which Brussels had expressed reservations. Shares in Lagardere and Thomson-CSF were suspended, while those of Alcatel fell three percent with investors expecting the group to make a new bid that could create uncertainties about the financing and its own profit recovery. Lagardere said in a statement it was still interested in taking over Thomson, which it called of strategic importance. A spokesman for Alcatel Alsthom said only the company ""took note"" of the decision. ""The chances (for Alcatel) have got to be increased by this, if they can come up with a different offer,"" said a Paris share broker, adding the decision was a blow to the government's standing. ""It doesn't look good for the French government."" Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk recently said he was ready to make a new offer for Thomson, breaking weeks of silence after French newspapers suggested Chirac might have been influenced by a disputed report of British plans to take over the company. Britain's GEC has said it is willing to talk about a cooperation deal with whoever wins Thomson. ($1=5.298 French Franc) ","MarcelMichelson"
"Informix Corp, still investing money and resources in a new generation of database software products, aims to increase its revenue by 30 percent in 1997, Informix's chief executive said. Thirty percent growth may fall short of what some investors would like to see, but Informix's top priority right now is beefing up marketing, not sales, said Phil White, CEO of the No. 2 database software company.   ""Wall Street thinks I'm investing too heavily because they don't see enough revenue growth,"" White said in a recent interview. ""But I'm going to have to invest for the future of the business, and I think what I'm doing is absolutely the best thing to do."" Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., writes computer programs that help companies store and retrieve huge amounts of vital corporate information, such as customer names and inventory lists. Its flagship database product is the data storehouse of companies such as MCI Communications Corp and investment bank CS First Boston.   In December, Informix introduced Universal Server, a database that is not only adept at storing text and numbers, the traditional format of corporate information. But it also can handle new types of data such as photographs, maps, sound and video -- the media that make the World Wide Web compelling and easy to use. White said he thought increasing demand for programs that store and retrieve sound and video, propelled by the growth of business on the Web, would drive sales of his Universal Server.   White said Informix would spend heavily this year on marketing its Universal Server in an effort to build on its lead over Oracle. There is a price, however. Informix's profit and revenue will not rise as fast as it has in recent years, White said. ""I've got the best technology, but I can't lay back and hope Oracle fails or Microsoft fails,"" he said. The prospect of slower profit growth has weighed down Informix's stock. In the past 12 months, the shares have lost more than half their value from a high of about 36. The stock was down 1/2 at 15-1/4 late Wednesday afternoon.   ""The growth rate has been disappointing,"" said Jim Pickrel, software analyst at investment bank Hambrecht &amp; Quist Group Inc in San Francisco. ""The earnings outlook for this year is fairly moderate."" In 1996, net income, including $5.91 million in acquisition expenses, was little changed at $97.8 million, or $0.63 a share, compared with $97.6 million, or $0.65, the previous year. The per-share figure fell as the company's shares outstanding rose 3 percent.   Revenue in 1996 rose 32 percent to $939.3 million from $714.2 million. By comparison, revenue jumped 50 percent in 1995 from 1994. Pickrel estimates per-share earnings in 1997 will rise to $0.86. While Universal Server's technology is impressive, sales will not likely take off until near year-end, Pickrel said. ""It will be a little tough for Informix to make headway against Oracle,"" he said. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Pan Am Corp. said Wednesday it was open to acquisitions and other business opporunities with an eye to expanding its four-jet Pan American World Airways, centred in south Florida. But a spokesman for the start-up airline with the legendary name of a defunct pioneer in commercial aviation declined to comment on a report Pan Am was in acquisition talks with larger regional rival Carnival Air Lines. Last July, Pan Am agreed to pay about $100 million for Carnival Air. But the transaction was called off after Pan Am examined the carrier's books and sought to rework the terms. ""We have said we will look at opportunities,"" Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kriendler said. He declined to discuss any pending transactions, including one reported by the Miami Herald that Pan Am was once again in talks with Carnival Air about a merger. Gabriel Gabor, a spokesman for privately held Carnival Air, also declined to comment on any contacts between the two companies but said Carnival Air had considered several possible deals. ""Over the course of 18 months, we have various talks about mergers, acquisitions and other business deals,"" Gabor said. ""But nothing is in ink."" A combination of Pan Am and Carnival Air, owned by Micky Arison, chief executive of leading cruise-ship operator Carnival Corp., would create a much larger regional airline with a total of 31 jets and more than 2,200 employees. Annual revenues would be an estimated $400 million, with operations centred in south Florida. ""All these small airlines are trying to fill the void left by Eastern, but no one has done it yet,"" said airline industry analyst John Pincavage at Dillon Read. Eastern Airlines was long the dominant carrier in Florida until it went out of business in the early 1990s. Pincavage said all small airlines had been hurt by the ValuJet crash in the Florida Everglades last May 11, in which 110 people died, and had a disappointing third quarter last year. Bigger rivals posted very high profits in that period, one of the strongest for airlines of the year. Shares of Pan Am, whose namesake once had as many as 160 jets but floundered in 1991, were down $1.375 to $10 on the American Stock Exchange. ","MichaelConnor"
"Australia's largest home mortgage lender warned on Wednesday that a proposed change to Australia's system of prudential regulation could lead to huge collapses like those seen in the U.S. savings and loan system. Commonwealth Bank of Australia Managing Director David Murray said proposals by a government-sponsored inquiry into the financial system to regulate banks, pension funds, insurers and other non-banks within the same prudential system was too risky. Murray told an audience of bankers and economists the proposal would create a system similar to that which regulated the U.S. savings and loan sector before widespread collapses in the 1980s. ""These proposals do take us into uncharted waters which set up for Australia a savings and loans system that cost the citizens of the United States an awful lot of money,"" he said. Murray's criticism of the plan to open up the banking payments system to greater competition and strip the Reserve Bank of Australia of its prudential supervision role is the first major attack on the official Wallis' report on the financial system since its release last week. The conservative Liberal/National government, which set up the Wallis Inquiry soon after its election last year, is currently considering Wallis' recommendations and is expected to make its recommendations later this year. Murray's broadside was immediately attacked by one of his audience at a Committee for Economic Development (CEDA) luncheon as emotive scare-mongering. Replying to a question from the floor, Murray said he would not back away from his comments, adding a bank or fund failure was too was too dangerous to risk changing the current system. He said the time was right to debate Wallis' plan and others should not shy away from being critical. At the moment, the Reserve Bank requires banks and others with banking licences to meet strict prudential requirements on capital reserves and stops non-banks from issuing cheques or allowing them access to the overnight payments system. The inquiry, headed by businessman Stan Wallis, recommended that non-banks such as pension funds, building societies and even telecommunications groups be allowed access to the payments system and be covered by a single new body called the Australian Prudential Regulation Commission. ""I would prefer that the Reserve Bank remain the prudential supervisor,"" Murray said. Later, Murray rejected the claim that he was scaremongering. ""More Australians have chosen to bank with us than any other financial institution. We're probably better aware of what is scaremongering and what is proper community debate than anybody else,"" he told reporters after his luncheon address. Commonwealth Bank which was government-owned until last year, has the largest number of retail savings and other accounts of all of Australia's banks. ""It's a matter of fact that the S&amp;L system in America cost their community A$110 billion (US$86 billion),"" he said. ""Why should I therefore condone a supervisory system that appears to be built that way,"" he said. ""(Wallis) has deliberately overlaid a number of deposit-taking institutions into one supervisory system. That's what the American system did and they got the S&amp;L problem. ""I see that potential here and I hope that it doesn't happen,"" he said. ","BernardHickey"

The four weak groups were gold and precious metals, forestry products, retail and transportation. Bre-X Minerals Ltd. continued its recent slide, dropping 1.40 to close at 19.80 on almost 3.7 million shares.

"China's foreign currency B share markets are expected to recover in 1997 thanks to the improving national economic outlook, but the fundamentals of most B share firms remain poor, analysts said on Monday. The B share markets in both Shanghai and Shenzhen have rollercoastered in the past few weeks in often feverish speculative trading, and are about 50 percent up on their low points of a couple of months ago. Additional solid gains are expected in 1997 once 1996 results are released by the end of April which, if conditions are right, could push the indices to records, analysts said. But the basic problems with the B share markets -- poor quality companies and low liquidity -- are unlikely to be resolved in 1997, they added. ""The markets are likely to recover next year,"" said a Shanghai stock analyst with a Chinese brokerage. ""I would expect Shanghai's B share index to breach the 105-point historical high. The key factor will be the improved national economy."" Most of the 1996 results, to be posted in April, are unlikely to be much of an improvement over the dismal 1995 results, analysts said. Shanghai B share firms as a whole posted net negative profit growth of 16.3 percent in 1995. ""Any rally in the B shares before the 1996 results come out will not be sustainable,"" said Edmond Huang, an analyst with ING-Barings in Shanghai. ""The recent gains have been driven by liquidity, not by fundamentals."" ""But the macro-economic environment is positive and most of these companies have bottomed out, so 1997 should be good for them,"" Huang added. Brokers in Shenzhen also said they expected to see the B share market performing strongly in 1997. ""Listed firms will see their operations greatly pick up in 1997 due to the two cuts in interest rates this year,"" a broker at Shenzhen J&amp;A Securities said. Year-on-year retail price inflation is expected to be about 6.0 percent in 1996, down from 14.8 percent in 1995 and well below a government target of 10 percent, figures issued by the State Statistical Bureau on Monday said. The slowdown of inflation rises prompted Beijing to cut bank interest rates in May and August this year, relieving the burden of listed firms. Analysts expect the People's Bank of China to cut interest rates again in the first half of next year. ""Company performance has been improving since the second half of this year,"" said an analyst. ""This will be a major factor to support the markets next year."" All China's B share firms were formerly state enterprises and many suffer from poor management and heavy debt loads which have made it difficult for them to cope with the tight credit policies in force since 1993. ""The long-term development of the B share markets lies in listing more high-quality companies,"" said one trader. ""But this problem is unlikely to be solved in one year."" ""With more such companies listed in Shenzhen, the market's liquidity will improve and investor confidence strengthen,"" a broker in Shenzhen said. Combined capitalisation of the Shanghai and Shenzhen B share markets is only about 35 billion yuan ($4.2 billion), with 42 B share companies listed in Shanghai and 43 in Shenzhen. ""The markets are too small with investors having little choice of which firms they would like to invest in, and institutions are able to easily manipulate the markets,"" said a trader.

"Canadians were stunned Sunday after a heartbreaking loss to the United States in the World Cup of Hockey dealt a crippling blow to the nation's pride. Canada's ""dream team"" -- a galaxy of National Hockey League stars including Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier and Eric Lindros -- fell to an upstart American squad in a gripping finale to the World Cup championship Saturday. Team USA, led by superb goaltending, defeated the Canadian squad 5-2 to win the best-of-three series in Montreal. Canadians -- who consider hockey more of a religion than a sport -- mourned the country's worst loss in international play since 1981 when the Soviet Union handed Team Canada a crushing defeat in the Canada Cup -- the precursor to the World Cup. Saturday night's loss has also rekindled fears of a further Americanisation of Canada's sacred game. ""I feel terrible, just terrible. That's why I'm here,"" Circiaco Deluca said as he quaffed a pint of beer in Wayne Gretzky's bar in Toronto, surrounded by mementos of past Canadian hockey glory. Gretzky, known as the Great One, summed up the feelings of most of his countrymen after Saturday's game. ""This is a crushed locker room right now and probably a crushed country. It's devastating,"" Gretzky told reporters. The disastrous outcome dominated the front pages of Canadian newspapers Sunday. ""DAMN YANKEES,"" screamed the Montreal Gazette newspaper. ""AMERICA'S GAME,"" cried the Toronto Star, Canada's largest newspaper. ""The U.S. roared into Canada like a mayhem-minded mob of Hell's Angels and left with a major chunk of our national heritage,"" wrote Star hockey columnist Damien Cox. The tabloid Toronto Sun featured a cartoon of the Statue of Liberty with a hockey stick in one hand and the World Cup trophy in another. Canada's defeat comes at a time when many fans are lamenting the steady Americanisation of their game. Computer-enhanced pucks, flashy uniforms with cartoon characters, and the NHL's expansion into non-traditional markets like Phoenix and Nashville have made hockey purists cringe. A Canadian-based team has not won the NHL's championship Stanley Cup since 1993 and appears likely to extend the losing streak for another year. Small market clubs in Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa are struggling to stay alive in the face of skyrocketing costs. Quebec City and Winnipeg have already seen their franchises flee south to wealthier markets. Frank Diponzio, a tourist from Rochester, N.Y., said hockey's future will depend on it growing in the bigger U.S. market. ""It's not as popular as baseball or football, but it's getting bigger. Beating Canada at home will help,"" he said in an interview. Some Canadian fans were bitter that Canadian-born Brett Hull, the son of hockey legend Bobby Hull, scored twice in Saturday's game -- for the United States. Hull, who has dual citizenship, played most of the game to chants of ""Brett Hull sucks"" from the partisan crowd in Montreal's Molson Centre. ""I think he should have played for Canada. It just shows a lack of respect for the country,"" said Trevor Murray, an 18-year-old student sporting a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater. But others said the younger, faster U.S. team deserved credit for a gritty performance. ""It's not a national catastrophe. They played a great game and we'll be back,"" said Jack Porter of Sudbury, Ontario. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"General Motors Corp. said Friday it will consolidate all of its commercial truck production in Flint, Mich., but will discontinue some engineering work there and in Lansing, Mich. The moves ensure a solid future for the automaker's truck plant in Flint, which will expand its work force by up to 3,000 jobs by the year 2001, according to United Auto Workers officials. It now employs about 2,000 workers. But the gain for Flint, a beleagured GM factory town hit hard by job losses in recent years, will be a blow to Detroit's inner city. GM said it will close a 78-year-old truck and bus chassis plant in Detroit that employs 494 people and move the production to Flint in the year 2000. About 90 engineers at the six-story plant will be transferred immediately to GM facilities in Pontiac, Mich. GM also will shift production of medium-duty commercial trucks from Janesville, Wis., to Flint, in 2001. The Janesville truck line employs about 1,000 people, but GM officials say many of those workers should be absorbed by Janesville's full-size sport utility vehicle assembly line. GM said the Janesville plant will build the next-generation Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon vehicles, but it did not disclose any plans to expand Janesville's capacity to build the trucks. GM will begin building the popular sport utility vehicles at a second plant, in Arlington, Texas, later this year. The auto giant said it will invest about $500 million in the Flint truck plant to prepare it for the medium-duty truck production and to expand its capacity to build the next generation of GM's full-size C/K pickup trucks. The plant currently builds larger commercial versions of C/K pickups, but before Friday's announcement, GM had not assigned it a future product, leaving its fate clouded. The investments will pay for two new body shops, a second paint shop and additional chassis, trim and general assembly lines at the facility. Expanded production at the plant will increase GM's truck production capacity by about 5 percent, allowing it to grab a bigger share of the expanding truck market. However, long before Flint sees new jobs at the truck plant, it will have to give up the jobs of about 950 engine and transmission engineers, which GM will transfer to other facilities in Warren and Milford, Mich., in 1998. GM also is discontinuing other powertrain engineering work in Lansing that employs about 600 people. That work also will be transferred to Warren and Milford. Another 550 engineers have already been transferred to those locations from elsewhere in the Detroit area, bringing the total affected by the powertrain moves to 2,100. The consolidation moves are aimed at reducing GM's production and operating costs, but GM officials did not specify the expected savings. ""The optimization of our facilities will allow us to reduce our structural costs, make better use of our resources and improve our productivity,"" said Ned McClurg, general manager of the GM Powertrain Group. Few of the production workers displaced by the moves will be left without a paycheck. Under GM's UAW contract, it must continue to pay workers who are idled by such actions. A day after it announced the long-awaited, $9.5 billion sale of its Hughes Aircraft defense operations to Raytheon Co., GM's stock had slipped 25 cents to $60.125 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

"Microsoft Corp, target of a long-running series of federal antitrust investigations, has been asked to provide documents for a new Texas state probe of the Internet market, officials said Tuesday. Mark Murray, a spokesman for the computer software giant, said Microsoft received a ""civil investigative demand"" Monday from the Texas attorney general's office, and company lawyers expect to cooperate with state officials. Texas officials are investigating ""the possibility of monopolization and other conduct in restraint of trade in the market for Internet software"" in violation of state antitrust laws, assistant attorney general Mark Tobey said in a letter to Microsoft. Among the documents requested in the wide-ranging demand were licensing agreements, strategic plans, budgets and financial projections and all documents related to competition in the market for Internet or Intranet software. ""We've just received this letter,"" Murray said. ""We're in the process of reviewing it, and we'll be working closely with them to identify the documents that they're looking for and provide them."" Microsoft's Internet software rival Netscape Communications Corp. received a similar demand more than a month ago and complied with it, said Gary Reback, attorney for the Mountain View, California, company and a prominent critic of Microsoft's business practices. ""I don't think Netscape was the target"" of the investigation, said Reback. ""It was pretty clear that they're not the target."" Last year Reback led Netscape's successful efforts to get the U.S. Justice Department to reopen its investigation of Microsoft, which in 1994 agreed to settle antitrust charges to end a four-year federal probe. Murray said the Justice Department is continuing the reopened investigation, which aims to determine whether Microsoft's Internet marketing practices violate the company's settlement agreement. Murray said it was not clear what aspects of Internet competition Texas was investigating. ""We are confident that once they have examined the facts they will agree that consumers are benefiting from the intense and healthy competition in internet software,"" he said. The letter from Tobey, chief of the antitrust section in Texas' consumer protection division, said the state was trying to determine whether there had been any violations of the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act of 1983. Reback said it was not unusual for states to pursue antitrust actions separately from the federal government. ""It's not uncommon, and in the past the state attorneys general have been in fact relatively active in merger enforcement and in a variety of antitrust contexts,"" he said. Texas officials could not be reached for comment. ","MartinWolk"
"British insurance broker and risk management consultant Willis Corroon Group Plc on Wednesday blamed sterling's strength and continued competition for a five percent fall in profits over the first three months of the year. Pre-tax profits first quarter fell to 45.7 million pounds ($74.7 million) in the first quarter from 48.1 million pounds last year. But after adjusting for the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements of 4.4 million pounds, underlying profits were up four percent. Brokerage and fee revenue from continuing operations fell by seven percent to 184.2 million pounds. Willis executive chairman John Reeve said the results were in line with expectations at the start of the year and reflected ""intensifying competition"" between underwriters which had led to further falls in premium rates. Shares in the company dipped slightly after the figures which analysts said broadly met forecasts, losing four pence to 144 pence by late morning. ""There's the effect of falling premium rates, the effect of the currency and an element of shifting profits from the first quarter to later in the year,"" said one analyst. ""They are looking to enhance shareholder value over time but it's not going to happen overnight. There isn't any great underlying revenue growth. Costs are likely to be held down and brokerage to remain flat so it's not very exciting basically."" The strengthening of sterling against the dollar and other currencies had a disproportionate effect on the results due to the weighting of foreign currency revenues in the company's global speciality businesses in the early part of the year. As previously forecast, changes in the pattern of the business were likely to reduce the proportion of annual profit arising in the first quarter, Reeve said. ""Against this background, our underlying performance is satisfactory, with encouraging growth in a number of key business segments,"" he said. Industry consolidation had led to significant shifts in the competitive environment and the resulting large combinations created both challenges and opportunities, said Reeve. A series of mergers among rivals has left Willis and British rival Sedgwick Group trailing far behind industry giants Aon Corp and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc of the U.S. Chicago-based Aon has bought out three of its rivals in the past six months and said only last week that it was still interested in doing more deals. Marsh &amp; McLennan's $1.8 billion acquisition of privately-owned Johnson &amp; Higgins in March has further increased the pressure on the two British brokers and raised the prospect of the two being pushed into each others arms as the only solution to their current difficulties. However, Willis has always brushed off suggestions it may be interested in teaming up with its British rival. Reeve said the company intended to continue to pursue its change programme, designed to alter fundamentally the way it does business and ""seize new development opportunities within the altered market-place.""

"The Australian stock exchange on Tuesday used the China visit of Prime Minister John Howard to make a high profile sales pitch for Chinese companies to list shares on Australia's stock market. The Australian prime minister, before meeting China's President Jiang Zemin, found time to open a seminar for China's market regulators and top-level managers of its state-run companies designed to show them why they should look to Australia to raise capital. Senior officials from the Australian Stock Exchange as well as brokerages and legal firms delivered the message that Australia had much to offer. ""Cross-border equities trading now amounts to around $4 trillion a year, which no stock market can afford to ignore,"" Australian Stock Exchange chairman Maurice Newman told the seminar. ""I hope that one day we may be able to welcome you to our market."" Most Chinese companies that have listed their shares abroad have chosen Hong Kong where investors have been snapping up China-related stocks. One recent listing of a China-linked company was nearly 900 times oversubscribed, and Australia may find it difficult to generate that kind of interest. Newman later told reporters that 19 of 31 Asian-owned companies on the Australian exchange already had a China connection. These companies have often used a corporation not based in China to make the listing, in effect sidestepping regulatory curbs in their home country. Trading in some of those issues has not been active. ""The liquidity of those companies is mixed,"" said Newman. ""As a group we would prefer that it were greater."" Australia may soon get its first direct Chinese listing. Taihang Cement, a cement producer based in the northern province of Hebei, has already gained approval from Chinese regulatory authorities for a foreign listing. Company officials told reporters they hoped to list their shares in Australia by the year-end. ""We chose Australia because we have a foundation there,"" said Zhang Zhixian, Taihang's manager of investment development, noting that the company exports cement to Australia. Company officials said the exact size of the offer had not been set but would range between 100 and 200 million yuan ($12-24 million). Other participants at the seminar said Australia might target its efforts at sectors where Australia is already strong, such as in natural resources. ""Australia would have a natural advantage in infrastructure and resource-based companies,"" said Tony Greenwood, of law firm Blake Dawson Waldron, noting the heavy weighting of such stocks in Australia. One area of concern for Chinese companies will be financial transparency, which has posed a problem for them in the past. Some Chinese companies have had trouble complying with domestic regulations and others have come under criticism in Hong Kong for lack of transparency. ""Our concern must also be the integrity of our market,"" said Newman. ""It is important that companies are familiar with our listing requirements and they observe them faithfully."" ","WilliamKazer"
"The government's latest airwaves auction looks likely to generate far less money for Uncle Sam than the $1.8 billion Congress was counting on to help balance the budget, regulators said over the weekend. By late Friday, the auction -- for a slice of spectrum that will allow users to gain access to the Internet over the airwaves or create wireless local phone networks -- had raised just $12.1 million. ""It's definitely not going to meet budget expectations,"" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview Friday. The sale began Tuesday. FCC officials said bidding among the 23 companies -- including units of BellSouth Corp., Comcast Corp. and a Bell Atlantic Corp./Nynex Corp. joint venture -- appears to be winding down. Analysts argued that the low total underscores the point that spectrum sales will probably not be the ""golden goose"" that lawmakers and the Clinton administration have looked to for eliminating the budget deficit. ""It's nice to think of it as government property that would earn the country some money,"" said analyst David Roddy of Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting Group. ""But the sale of the spectrum was too much and too fast."" Said Elliott Hamilton, an analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm: ""It's not an endless supply of gold out there at the end of the rainbow."" ""Congress, the White House and the FCC have to sit down and start rationalising their approach to spectrum."" The ""wireless communications services"" or WCS auction is the FCC's 14th airwaves sale. Potential applications for the spectrum include broadband wireless access to the Internet, wireless local phone networks, and location services for pinpointing trucks and other vehicles. The auctions have netted the government about $23 billion, far more than expected. But prices have begun to slide as more spectrum is sold, contributing to financial problems among wireless carriers and raising doubts over whether Uncle Sam ever will collect all the money it is owed. Looking ahead, the Clinton administration proposed in its 1998 budget to raise $36.1 billion by selling licenses to firms wanting to sell new ways to link to the Internet or send video images through the air, among other possible services. ""They're not going to make that,"" predicted Roddy of Deloitte &amp; Touche. Indeed, the WCS sale offered a new twist. In its zeal to balance the budget, Congress last year required the FCC to hold the auction by April 15 and to collect the proceeds by Sept. 30, the last day of the 1997 fiscal year. FCC officials said the timetable has contributed to the meagre returns. Potential bidders, communications-equipment manufacturers and wireless investors were not given enough time to fully analyse the auction, they said. ""This is exactly why we told Congress we should always have at least a year's advance notice,"" said Hundt, adding that his agency was given less than five months. Some on Capitol Hill are eyeing the problem. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who heads the commerce committee, plans to offer a bill soon to try and maximize the money the government raises in auctions. To prevent spectrum from being dumped on the market, the bill would allow for a ""reasonable time lag"" between the allocation of the spectrum and its sale by the FCC. The nation's broadcasters, in the transition to digital television, are using recent auction woes as evidence that they should not have to hand back their analogue TV licenses by the year 2006. The permits would be auctioned for other uses. ""Such proposals will undermine our ability to meet the challenges of moving our nation into the digital future, and will simply not be achievable on the revenue side,"" the National Association of Broadcasters told lawmakers. Hundt disagrees. ""Everyone who has spectrum wants to make sure that no one else ever gets any."" ","RogerFillion"
"Barclays Plc shares slid lower on Tuesday after the bank announced 1996 pretax profits at the lower end of market expectations, including a slump in its investment banking unit BZW. The shares were quoted 25p lower at 1174.5p at 1150 GMT, having hit a low of 1131p, after news that pretax profits rose by 13 percent to 2.36 billion pounds ($3.82 billion), including an exceptional 70 million pounds gain on disposals. This was at the low end of analysts' forecasts and included a 29 percent fall in operating profits at BZW to 204 million pounds. The group, which has already performed more than one billion pounds of share repurchases in the last 18 months, said it would return 500 million pounds to shareholders in the next 12 months and raised its dividend by 21 percent to 31.5 pence, in line with forecasts. Chief executive Martin Taylor mounted a spirited defence of the results and his strategy at BZW, saying that the British banking figures were ""cracking"" and that Barclays was investing for the future at the investment bank. ""You have to be careful not to be frightened by your own shadow,"" Taylor told Reuters in an interview. ""The reason that the returns are depressed (at BZW) this year is that we're spending so much."" Taylor said that if Barclays had invested less in BZW, the unit's profits would have been higher, but that without the investment, BZW would be a weaker firm. In a statement earlier, Barclays reported underperformance by BZW in the fixed income market, with the exception of sterling, and in foreign exchange, in which said it had performed poorly in an increasingly competitive market. Taylor said BZW would continue to incur quite high costs in the first half of the current year and would then face the disruption of moving its offices to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands. ""I would hope that the second half would be a lot better,"" he added. BZW has had a turbulent time in the past year, which started with the death of its chief executive, David Band, and has included high-level management shake-ups. It has also been involved in what have been perceived as some high-profile problems with clients. The biggest of these was its takeover defence for Northern Electric against U.S. energy group CE Electric, which is being investigated by Britain's Takeover Panel. The late disclosure by BZW of a 250,000 stg discretionary fee clause meant that CE's offer was extended and it captured Northern by the slimmest of margins. But Taylor said that well-publicised events last year, such as the Northern Electric defence, had not done BZW damage. ""I think Northern Electric showed BZW behaving very energetically to try and prevent a client being taken over and almost succeeding,"" Taylor said. ""We very nearly saved it."" On the share price reaction, one broker's head of equity sales said, ""The results were very disappointing and there will be some downgrades as a result. ""The trials and tribulations at the investment banking arm look as if they will probably be continuing into the next year,"" he said. Taylor said Barclays was looking for the best way to return the bank's excess capital to shareholders but rejected the idea of a special dividend, saying that share repurchases help non-sellers to concentrate their position. He noted that earnings per share had risen by 25 percent to 104.2p. Taylor also rejected the notion that Barclays was devoid of ideas because it wanted to return capital. He said the bank would make acquisitions if they added to shareholder value but could see none on the horizon at present. ""We're already growing very quickly right across our personal sector business,"" Taylor said. ""Both the personal bank and the business bank have had a cracking year."" ","JoeOrtiz"
"Regional Baby Bell phone companies appear to have triumphed over their long-distance rivals in a crucial regulatory battle that would leave some customers paying more and others less for their monthly bill. The Federal Communications Commission has decided against ordering a precipitous cut in the $23 billion long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp pay the Bells each year for access to their local phone networks, said FCC and industry officials.   Bell executives at one point feared such cuts could cost their companies as much as $10 billion in revenues. Consumer groups and long-distance companies more recently advocate immediate cuts in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, saying that would mean a similar cut in long-distance rates. ""The Bells have dodged a bullet,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group. ""They may get grazed. But they dodged a bullet that was aimed at them during the last six months."" The rules are set to be voted on next week. Less clear is the impact on phone customers. Those who make lots of long-distance calls would see a sizeable drop in their bill, said FCC and industry officials. But wireless phone subscribers could pay anywhere from one percent to two percent more a month through new fees. Customers with more than one phone line for a computer or the kids and who make few long-distance calls would see a monthly rate rise of around $1 or more.   ""We're cutting away the frills,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview. He is a big advocate of the rules under consideration that are expected to be voted on next week. ""We're talking about a $1 subsidy per month that we're eliminating for somebody who's connecting a $2,500 computer to that line and purchasing $20 a month of unlimited access,"" Hunt said. Instead of a government-imposed cut, the FCC plans to rely on market powers to lower access charges over time, said FCC and industry officials. That could mean an FCC-imposed loss of Bell revenues of no more than $1 billion the first year. FCC officials, meanwhile, say the plan would yield a cut in long-distance charges of more than $1 billion in year one.   FCC officials are against a steep cut for several reasons. Citing rate hikes by AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp late last year, they fear long-distance carriers may not fully pass on the cut to consumers and pocket some of the money. Long-distance executives vow to pass on the cuts. FCC officials also fear a sharp cut would unleash a rise in local phone rates by carriers trying to recoup lost money. ""We're keeping basic residential dial tone at today's price,"" said Hundt. Critics charge the plan -- which could still change before next week -- would mean higher rates. AT&amp;T says long-distance customers will see a $1.5 billion jump at the outset in July. ""Regulators appear unlikely to squeeze the fat out of the Bells' prices, leaving consumers paying for inflated rates,"" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union. But Hundt says that over the next five years at least $10 billion ""will be transferred to consumers"" via access cuts. The plan also would pay for $3 billion to connect schools, libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet and provide cheap phone service for the poor.   Access charges were created after the 1984 breakup of Ma Bell. Experts agree the $23 billion is more than the cost of providing access to the local phone network. But they cannot agree on the amount. FCC officials said 85 percent of the nation's 80 million residential phone customers would see a lower monthly bill. Those who make lots of long-distance calls would benefit the most, because the agency plans to replace some of the existing per-minute access charges with a monthly flat rate. The 15 percent of residents who do not make long-distance calls would see their bills stay the same. The monthly flat rate ""subscriber line charge"" customers pay to the local phone company is likely to remain $3.50. But customers with more than one line and who make few long-distance calls are likely to see a rate rise. That's because the ceiling, or cap, on the subscriber line charge is expected to rise to $5 a month from $3.50 for each additional residential line, and to roughly $7 a line for multi-line business customers from $6 a month. One possible way around the charge may be for customers to list their additional lines in a different name or use another local carrier, said industry officials.   Meanwhile, large businesses or consumers who make a lot of long-distance calls could well see a drop in their phone bill because the FCC plans to lower the permanent access charge to about two cents a minute from about 5.4 cents. To make up the lost revenues, the FCC plans to require long-distance carriers to pay local carriers a new monthly ""pre-subscribed line charge"" for each long-distance customer. The charge -- which will range from 75 cents a month for single-line residents to $4.50 a month a line for multi-line businesses -- are intended to better reflect the actual costs of using the local phone network.

"A key consultant's report on Tuesday shed more light on how tampering occurred at the worthless Busang gold project in Indonesia, once touted by Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. as the strike of the century. While shareholders bailed out of the former stock market darling on Tuesday, investigators and analysts were trying to figure out how the country's biggest swindle could have happened. Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., the firm hired by Bre-X that delivered a devastating audit of Busang on Sunday, gave some clues in its full interim report released on Tuesday. Strathcona said its experts initially found it hard to believe that tampering could have happened on such a grand scale. Bre-X's last resource estimate of 71 million ounces of gold at Busang was based on data pulled from 16,400 samples. But after a month-long study, Strathcona said ""there appears to be little alternative but to conclude that virtually all the gold in the samples submitted by Bre-X for assaying has originated from some other source."" Bre-X's storage warehouse near the Borneo town of Samarinda, where core samples were kept for a lengthy period of time, was the most likely spot for any tampering, the report said. Under Bre-X's system, the core samples from the Busang site were shipped by boat to Samarinda and then trucked to Balikpapan for assaying. The samples spent several weeks at Samarinda before they were sent to Indo Assay Laboratories in Balikpapan. Strathcona said the precision of tampering was impressive. It suggested those involved had detailed knowledge of the region and how to add the right amounts of gold to match the site's geology. ""We can only suggest that somewhere enroute, probably at Samarinda, there has been a laboratory or facilities established that have allowed very precise additions of the foreign gold,"" the report said. The report also revealed that Bre-X officials had studies last November that showed serious abnormalities in its Busang gold find. During its audit, Strathcona reviewed a feasibility review by Kilborn SNC-Lavalin Inc. and a metallurgical study performed by Australia's Normet Pty Ltd. Both studies were commissioned by Bre-X. Strathcona said it was ""struck by"" Normet's statement that more than 90 percent of the gold in Bre-X's Busang samples were consistent with alluvial, or river, gold. Busang is considered a bedrock deposit. Before Sunday's devastating news, Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh had dismissed doubts about Busang that had dogged his company since March. He said he was shocked by Strathcona's report and vowed to find the culprits. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has investigators from its commercial crime unit studying the Strathcona report, but no formal probe had been launched, it said. Rumours about Busang surfaced in March when Busang chief geologist Michael de Guzman allegedly jumped it to his death from a helicopter while flying to a meeting with Bre-X partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., a big mining company based in New Orleans. Freeport had summoned de Guzman to explain why Bre-X's estimates of 71 million ounces of gold at Busang did not match Freeport's findings. About a week after de Guzman's death, as rumours about Freeport's findings pounded Bre-X's stock, the Toronto Stock Exchange asked Freeport to issue a statement. Freeport stunned investors on March 26 when the company said its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold. Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona to audit the project. The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares on March 27, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's market value in one day. Freeport and an Indonesian company said on Monday they planned to pull out of the Busang project. Bre-X's stock plunged C$3.17 to C6 cents in frenzied action after it resumed trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) on Tuesday. Bre-X's stock value had once topped C$6 billion ($4.4 billion). ""Investors are very disenchanted. Very disappointed and they're selling it just to get it off their backs,"" Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities, said on Tuesday. The legal fallout from the Busang bust continued on Tuesday with another class action suit filed against Bre-X Minerals, raising the number of suits against Bre-X to at least nine. New York law firm Wechsler Harwood Halebian &amp; Feffer LLP said it was seeking to recover damages for shareholders hurt by the Bre-X selloff. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday said it plans to release an operating system that will work on personal computers based on chips from Intel Corp. as well as on Apple computers. At its annual developer conference, the company also said it will release programming tools in the next few months that will allow companies to write software for Apple computers once and automatically convert their products to run on PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Corp. Windows software. The radical strategy is part of Apple's plan to keep software companies from abandoning Apple products, Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio told a crowd of 1,900 programmers here. ""For those of you who seek substantial business on both the Mac and Windows platforms, this new development environment holds tremendous promise,"" Amelio said. ""You can (write your applications once) and with a simple recompilation release them for both platforms."" Until now, Apple has released operating system software that only runs on Apple-designed hardware. Amelio said Apple's next-generation operating system, code-named Rhapsody, will not only run on Apple-designed computers, but also on PCs based on Intel chips and using Microsoft Windows software. For the past two years, Apple has been scrambling to come up with improvements to the Macintosh that would set it apart from PCs. Until 1995, Apple had relied on its computers' famed ease-of-use as a selling point, but Microsoft's release of Windows 95 took away much of the impact of Apple's pitch. Last year, Apple gave up on a mired effort to revamp the Macintosh Operating System, the fundamental programme that gives the Mac its look. In December, the company bought Next Software Inc. to get its software overhaul going again, and to use its software as the foundation of a next-generation operating system. The move concerned lots of programmers, though, because of fears that the new operating system would not run the products they designed for the older Mac operating system. Programmers also were not thrilled to develop products for yet another operating system. Apple plans to spend the rest of this week convincing programmers that it is a worthwhile investment to write software for Rhapsody. Programmes written for Rhapsody will be able to run on old Macs, a new class of Apple machines using the Rhapsody operating system, and PCs running the Windows operating system, Amelio promised. Investors, however, evidently decided to wait a while before rendering judgment, and Apple's stock ended unchanged at $17.5625 on Nasdaq. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Global media group News Corp Ltd told analysts in a telephone briefing on Thursday that it still expected 20 percent profit growth for the 1996/97 year, despite a below-expectations first half profit result, analysts said.

"China was silent on Tuesday on the fragile health of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping after Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and other leaders cut short out-of-town trips to visit the ailing patriarch. The State Council, or cabinet, declined on Tuesday to make immediate comment on the rumours that the health of Deng, 92, had deteriorated recently or that he had suffered a stroke. In Taipei, Taiwan's top policymaker on mainland affairs described Deng's condition as serious and said the government would closely watch developments. Party chief Jiang, who is also state president and head of the army, returned at the weekend, cutting short an unpublicised visit to the communist revolutionary base of Ganzhou in central Jiangxi province, said one Chinese source close to the party. Premier Li Peng also flew back to Beijing at the weekend, abruptly curtailing a tour of the booming southern province of Guangdong because of Deng's deteriorating health, said the source, who asked not to be identified. The two leaders had returned to Beijing where they visited Deng, the source said. Deng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded compound behind the Forbidden City of China's emperors in central Beijing. Diplomats have said one barometer of Deng's health in China's highly-secretive system is the travel of top leaders and close family members, with few willing to be out of town or abroad if Deng were close to death. Vice-Premier Li Lanqing was abroad on a visit to Israel and Iran, and Defence Minister Chi Haotian was in the Philippines, where officials said he would not change his travel plans. Chinese sources have reported increasing rumours in Beijing in the past few days that Deng's health may be failing. However, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week Deng was all right for a man of his age. Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper reported at the weekend that the architect of China's sweeping economic reforms had been rushed to hospital on Thursday after a massive stroke that followed an earlier, mild stroke. Doctors said that if Deng's stroke had been a haemorrhage he could have died within hours, while if it was a thrombosis, or formation of a blood clot, he could last days or weeks. Rumours about Deng's health surface periodically and one such rumour caused Hong Kong stocks to tumble last Friday. The worries over Deng's health deflated Taiwan's main stock index by 1.161 percent to 7563.76 on Tuesday morning while Hong Kong's major index slipped 0.80 percent to 13039.03. Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival when he appeared frail and faltering on a visit to Shanghai. He is now believed to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity. China's elderly leaders exert great influence after their retirement in a society where age is revered and in a communist system in which officials spend years building up a power base. Deng retired from his last official position in 1990 and his only post is honorary chairman of China's Bridge Association, a title that reflects his passion for the card game. Deng was in the public eye at the start of the new year when state television ran a 12-part documentary on his life, but without details of his present circumstances or interviews with his wife or children. Western diplomats say the longer Deng lingers the less impact his death will have on the delicate balance of power at the top of China's ruling Communist Party. ","JaneMacartney"
"Australian appliance, packaging and wine group Southcorp Holdings Ltd on Tuesday reported a 22.3 percent rise in first half net profit and tipped a record result for the year to June 30. Southcorp posted a net profit after abnormals of A$64.92 million for the six months ended December 31, 1996, compared with A$52.36 million a year earlier. ""We are now on track to meet our year-end forecast and our year-end forecast is broadly in line with market expectations,"" chief executive officer Graham Kraehe told reporters.   Kraehe said market expectations were around A$130 million net profit before abnormals. Southcorp reported a net profit of A$124.22 million in 1995/96, which included a record second half profit of A$64.3 million. ""Each business, we expect, in the full year, as they have in the last two periods, to grow earnings over the corresponding period,"" he said. Kraehe said the forecasts were dependent on there being no significant downturn in the Australian economy. ""On that basis, we are very confident that 1996/97 will be another record year for Southcorp.""   The December 1996 half results showed a profit improvement for all three divisions, with its appliance division growing the strongest despite lower sales. Kraehe said in a statement the strong appliance division result reflected cost cuts and better productivity, supported by the launch of a range of new whitegoods products. But its American Water Heater business, formerly called Mor-Flo, continued to make losses although they were half of the A$2.1 million loss in the June 1996 period. Group sales fell 0.5 percent to A$1.30 billion in the first half and dividends were steady at 8.25 cents a share.   Kraehe said Southcorp was still on the prowl for more acquisitions in the wine business, particularly in overseas markets, and also add-on acquisitions in packaging. ""For acquisitions, we are looking at, internationally in wine and in areas in packaging, which add on to our core businesses, either in Australia, North America or Asia."" ""We are also looking at some Asian development, which will essentially be greenfield development,"" Kraehe said. Southcorp is currently building a manufacturing plant in Dalian, China, to make steel and aluminium cans.   ""Whatever we do (in wine), if it is in Australia or if it is something offshore, the end result is that it is going to be able to better serve the international markets, that says that the probability is that it (acquisition) is going to be offshore,"" Kraehe said. ""In Australia our primary focus is to continue to invest in our our strong vineyard and winery facilities...with a heavy focus on red (wine),"" he said. Southcorp made two wine acqusitions in Australia in 1996 but had no plans to raise new funds for any more purchases.   ""Our gearing has come down to a pretty comfortable level, if we wanted to do something major, particularly something major in wine, that could cause us to look at means of raising capital,"" Kraehe said. ""But generally speaking we could fund an acquisition and development programmes within our existing cash flow,"" he said. Southcorp's net debt to equity fell to 63.7 percent in the December half, from 72.1 percent a year earlier. Southcorp shares closed steady at A$4.56. The shares hit a record high of A$4.66 last Tuesday. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","KevinMorrison"
"CompuServe Corp is in talks to be acquired by America Online Inc, a move that would bring new members to AOL, beef up its network and expand its corporate and international presence, industry sources said on Wednesday. Earlier, CompuServe and H&amp;R Block Inc confirmed market rumors that they were in discussions for a possible ""business combination"" involving CompuServe. Neither CompuServe nor H&amp;R Block, which owns about 80 percent of the computer online service, would provide further details.   Industry sources said AOL was involved in talks to buy its beleaguered competitor, possibly in an all-stock transaction. ""It's part of the consolidation mechanism that is taking place in the marketplace,"" said Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects in Washington. ""They have had conversations off and on....Probably this conversation has gotten reasonably heavy since AOL got into problems having to spend all sorts of money on its network.""   An H&amp;R Block spokeswomen said she could not elaborate on a statement that confirmed Block and CompuServe were engaged in external discussions regarding a possible business transaction with CompuServe. AOL declined to comment on the market rumors of talks with CompuServe.   While AOL shares jumped on Tuesday as rumors circulated in the market, the stock retreated 1-1/8 on Wednesday to 44-5/8, as some analysts said such a deal would prove distracting and costly for AOL, given its current problems achieving profitability. ""There is not a lot of value to the CompuServe subscriber base,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co analyst. ""There is no guarantee they would stay with AOL. It would be a very dilutive and distracting acquisition for AOL,"" he said. ""AOL is just about to turn profitable here, and we don't need them to buy a money-losing company.""   ""There is no good reason for AOL to buy CompuServe,"" said Abhishek Gami, a Nesbitt Burns Securities analyst. ""If AOL does buy them, it would be a major negative for AOL."" He said a merger would raise the eyebrows of antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department because it would result in a big gain in AOL's share of the U.S. online services market. AOL, the No.1 online service, currently has eight million members. CompuServe is second with 3.1 million in the United States and Europe and 2.2 million licensed members in Japan, where it receives royalty payments.   However, AOL and CompuServe both provide Internet access, and that market has many more players than the proprietary online service business, where there are only four main providers. Analysts said AOL would have to pay for any deal with stock because of its cash position is low. Its cash and equivalents were listed at $130 million at the end of 1996. Using AOL's stock to pay for the 92.6 million CompuServe shares outstanding (of which H&amp;R Block owns about 74 million) would dilute AOL's shares. Despite the negative reactions, some analysts said a CompuServe merger could be appealing to AOL.   Integration of the contrasting images of AOL and CompuServe could also present a big problem. AOL is mainly seen as a consumer online service, while CompuServe is more oriented to business customers and users with more technical sophistication. Indeed, some analysts said it would be difficult to convert die-hard CompuServe users to AOL. ""Domestically, being a CompuServe user is almost a positive statement that one is not an AOL user,"" said Adam Schoenfeld, a Jupiter Communications analyst. ""AOL has probably already poached every CompuServe user possible.""     Some analysts said that CompuServe might be a better match for one of the regional Bell operating companies, some of whom are still seeking to enter the Internet access business. ""It has a national network and a well-known brand name that could be reinvigorated,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with Arlen Communications Inc in Bethesda, Maryland. ""You don't want to count out the telcos."" ","TheresePoletti"
"A two-year campaign by China's financial overlords to force state banks out of the stock markets has succeeded, reducing bank risk and widespread irregularities, analysts said on Wednesday. The campaign, launched in early 1995 to force banks to close or hive off their stock trading subsidiaries and investment firms, had been effective in stopping the use of state assets for gambling on the stock markets, bankers said. ""The process of separating banks from the stock and trust and investment businesses has largely been completed,"" said a banker with the Bank of China, reached by telephone in Beijing. ""This has greatly reduced the risks caused by banks trading on the volatile stock markets."" In early 1995, Chinese state-run banks owned more than 1,000 securities offices with combined assets of more than 40 billion yuan ($4.8 billion), most of them set up during the stock fever that followed the launch of China's stock markets in 1990. By the end of 1996, most of the offices had either been sold to securities houses, closed or made independent, bankers said. Bank shares in securities brokerages had largely been sold to the brokerages and major industrial and commercial firms, they said. Chinese bankers said they generally welcomed the move, in particular given the losses their securities subsidiaries suffered in the long market slump from early 1994 to mid-1996. In mid-1995, China promulgated the ""Commercial Bank Law"", which bans banks from trading in stocks or doing trust and investment business, giving the central bank a legal basis for the clean-up campaign. ""The separation has effectively driven bank money away from the highly risky stock trading,"" said a banker with the Shanghai-based Communications Bank. ""It has also eradicated some sources of irregularities on the stock markets."" One problem was the temptation for banks to make funds in their control available to securities subsidiaries for stock trading on credit. Branches of all major Chinese banks and securities houses were also fined or publicly criticised in late 1996 by financial authorities for illegally feeding credit into initial public offerings on China's domestic A share markets. ""Many bank securities branches have been acquired by major securities brokerages and continue their business under different company names,"" said one executive with a major Chinese securities house. ""This has given the large securities companies an easy way to expand."" The official Xinhua news agency reported last week that by the end of 1996, China's four largest state-owned banks had largely pulled out of the trust and investment business. Of a total of 186 trust and investment firms formerly owned by the banks -- the Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Agricultural Bank, the Bank of China, and the Construction Bank of China -- 148 now operated separately while the remainder were in the process of becoming independent, the agency said.

"Britain was a step closer to completing the privatisation of passenger rail services on Thursday after announcing the preferred bidders for two more franchises which helped send the companies' shares soaring. The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) said Great Western Holdings Ltd had been chosen as the preferred bidder for the North West Regional Railways franchise in northwest England. Existing management and employees own 51 percent of the bid group, with FirstBus and 3i venture capital owning 24.5 percent each. The Thameslink franchise was awarded to GOVIA which comprises of Go-Ahead Group Plc and French transport group VIA-GTI. That leaves just three of the total 25 franchises to be awarded ahead of the deadline for the British election due by May 1997. Apart from the franchise for routes in Central England, the remaining deals are ScotRail and North East Regional Rail. The franchise sales will completes the controversial privatisation of Britain's rail industry which began in 1995 and included the sell-off of rail infrastructure under Railtrack and the sale of the three rolling stock leasing companies. Go-Ahead's commercial director Chris Moyes welcomed the news and told Reuters the line had huge potential because it provided a link from the financial district of London to Gatwick and Luton airports. He said finalisation of the deal could add 100 million pounds ($162 million) of extra revenue to Go-Ahead's figures. ""We aim to capitalise on our existing commuter traffic and improve the links to the airports. There is enormous scope,"" he said pointing to the example of the fast-link Gatwick Express service from Victoria which serves the West London travellers. Opraf also announced that a revised shortlist for Central Trains had been drawn up, cutting the orignal list of five to National Express Group and Straightforward Lines which contains FirstBus and the existing management team. FirstBus chairman, Trevor Smallwood, said whoever won the Central deal, which covers routes in central England, could see revenues of around 70 million pounds. His company must now make renewed presentations against National Express in a fight to the finish. A final decision is expected in the next two weeks when financial details of each deal will be revealed including the service, investment and subsidy levels for the franchise term. The latest round of winners saw their shares roar ahead in celebration, with Go-Ahead leading the pack with a 36 pence rise to 515 by the close. National Express was up 26 pence at 547 and FirstBus was up 12 1/2 pence at 241. The sector has seen spectacular growth in share prices in the past year as more bus operators have moved into railways, taking advantage of the opportunities opened up by privatisation.

"Opponents of U.S. trade concessions to China are expected to mount the fiercest congressional battle in years to overturn President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's favoured trading status. While supporters of the president's decision on Monday to renew China's most favoured nation (MFN) status for another year remain confident of victory, opponents -- ranging from social conservatives to organised labour -- are revving up for a fight. The unusual coalition is blasting the move from both sides of the political spectrum, hitting China's policies on human rights, labour rights, religious rights, trade and abortion. Opponents are also gathering strength from worries over the transfer this summer of Hong Kong to China, as well as the brouhaha over charges that Beijing tried to sway U.S. elections through illegal campaign contributions. ""With Hong Kong and campaign finance lurking in the background, it will definitely be a tougher fight,"" a congressional aide, who requested anonymity, said. ""A lot depends on what happens between now and the vote."" Another congressional aide said, ""The coalition of the AFL-CIO and social conservatives makes for a potent force."" House Speaker Newt Gingrich said this year's decision would be closer than last year's 286-141 vote in the House to back Clinton on MFN. But advocates and even opponents expect the president's policy ultimately to survive. Even if lawmakers muster enough votes to reject the president's decision -- which is considered unlikely -- opponents doubt they could round up the two-thirds vote needed to override an expected veto from Clinton. Congress later this summer will vote on whether to overturn Clinton's decision, with the House voting first. ""The opponents have a better chance than they have had in the past several years. But it still may not be enough of a margin to withstand a veto,"" said Thea Lee, international expert at the AFL-CIO, which opposes MFN status for China. But even a defeat for MFN's opponents could amount to a sort of victory if the vote is close enough. ""It represents an important turning point in the growing uneasiness among both Democrats and Republicans over the current China trade policy,"" Lee said. Gary Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said: ""The president's action represents the high-water mark of the pro-MFN forces. As the truth of the human rights violations in China reaches the American public, the case for MFN collapses."" A sign Clinton will face tougher sledding emerged a week ago, when an influential House Republican leader urged the president to revoke China's MFN status, citing Beijing's record on human rights, weapon sales and trade. Representative Bill Paxon of New York, a Gingrich ally who chairs meetings of the Republican House leadership team, said current U.S. policy had yielded only ""a Chinese regime which thumbs its nose at the United States and places its heel on the neck of freedom."" Democratic lawmakers echo that view. Since Clinton ""delinked trade from human rights three years ago, the human rights situation in China and Tibet has deteriorated, the U.S. trade deficit with China has soared, and China's authoritarian government has continued its sale of nuclear, chemical, missile and biological weapons technology to dangerous countries, including Iran,"" Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said. But supporters of the administration's policy remain confident. ""In the end, the votes will be there for MFN,"" said Calman Cohen of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, representing the heads of big U.S. corporations. ","RogerFillion"
"Future Hong Kong lawmakers on Saturday agreed on a formula to pass laws for the territory in face of mounting anger over Beijing's plans to roll back civil liberties after taking back sovereignty from Britain. The provisional legislature met in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, to decide the format which will enable it to pass bills, including those to dilute existing Hong Kong laws protecting civil rights. The China-crafted interim chamber, which Beijing intends to put in place of the present elected legislature at the handover, agreed all three required readings of proposed bills could take place before July 1. The bills would then be confirmed and made into laws on July 1, the local cable television station reported. Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to China at midnight on June 30. The move followed a heated debate this week after the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, launched plans to curb protests and foreign funding of Hong Kong political groups after the handover. ""Some members feel that since we have been empowered to scrutinise and to pass laws before July 1, then that power should be used before July 1,"" provisional legislator Selina Chow said. ""(It will) enable some absolutely essential legislation to enjoy the certainty of having been passed before July 1 so as to avoid a legal vacuum."" Pro-democracy activists have threatened to sue the 60-strong provisional chamber if it passes any laws, holds meetings or opens offices on Hong Kong soil before July 1. Hong Kong democrats regard the interim legislature as a breach of the territory's post-handover constitution. Earlier, they launched a protest banner attached to dozens of colourful helium-filled balloons. ""Against the provisional legislature passing laws before July 1,"" the banner read. The protesters cheered as it floated towards China. Tung's proposals on civil liberties were widely expected after Beijing resolved in February to repeal or amend existing Hong Kong laws protecting freedoms and political rights. But the plan has sparked a fiery debate locally and drawn criticism from the United States. Hong Kong people will need police permission to demonstrate after July 1, a far cry from the current practice of merely notifying police beforehand. With the lawmaking formula in place, the provisional chamber is now in a position to enact Tung's plans into law. Hong Kong's 6.4 million people have been given three weeks to comment on the proposals. The rights issue looked sure to remain in the international spotlight after U.S. officials said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would hold talks on Monday with the leader of Hong Kong's democracy movement Martin Lee, now on a lobbying and fund-raising mission in the United States. But there is little to suggest that China will yield to pressure over its plans. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday praised the provisional legislature and its work, a local newspaper said. In a Beijing meeting with Rita Fan, president of the provisional chamber, Qian was quoted by Fan as saying he was very satisfied with the interim chamber and would give his full support. ","TanEeLyn"
"The BBC announced ""historic"" plans to break into the domestic commercial television market on Monday, linking up with British satellite cable broadcaster Flextech Plc to offer up to eight new pay television channels. Flextech, majority-owned by America's biggest cable television group Tele-Communications International Inc, is contributing 22 million pounds ($35.2 million) of equity and can make 118 million pounds in credit facilities available to the ventures. Flextech and BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm, announced in September an agreement to form a joint venture to create a series of mainly digital subscription television channels in Britain, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Irish Republic. After months of talks, 36 separate legal agreements and six major research programmes, the two groups said that they planned to form two joint ventures to combine the BBC's archive, scheduling and production skills with Flextech's funds and multi-channel TV management and marketing knowledge. The principal deal will be to develop and launch  mainly digital new pay-television channels in Britain. The second is to buy out and develop in analogue, and later in digital formats, what is currently UK Gold, one of the most successful channels transmitted by one of British Sky Broadcasting 's multi-channel packages. ""The joint ventures with the BBC represent a major opportunity for the long term development of Flextech and the consolidation of its position in the multi-channel television market in the UK,"" Flextech's chief executive Roger Luard said. Dubbed Horizons, Showcase, Style, One-TV, Arena, Learnings, Catch-up TV and Sports Entertainment Network, the eight planned channels include factual programmes, comedy and drama, leisure and lifestyle, the youthful spirit of Radio 1 on TV, music and arts, education, sports news and analysis and recently-transmitted programmes on BBC1 and BBC2. Under terms of its licence, the BBC has to show its programmes first for free to domestic British audiences who fund the corporation though television licence fees. ""These channels will have widespread appeal and will, we believe, play an important role in the future growth and development of multi-channel television,"" Luard said. Flextech and BBC Worldwide will take a 50 percent stake in the two ventures for up to 30 years. The service will be rolled out towards in late 1997. Adam Singer, the president and chief operating officer of TINTA, told a news conference he expected to see ""close to $1.0 billion coming back to the BBC over the next three or four years"" through its pay TV deals in Britain and North America. BBC Worldwide is developing channels for the U.S. and other markets with Discovery Inc, a sister firm to TINTA. ""Outside the UK, the BBC is probably the last, great, under-utilised English language library in the world,"" Singer said. BBC Worldwide is keen to stress that its move into commercial television will benefit both the company and its national audience -- that pays its licence fee -- by supplementing its licence income ""in a meaningful way"". And the deals leave Flextech, which will receive most of the cash flow until its debt is repaid, as a serious contender to British satellite broadcaster BSkyB as a key pay television programme provider. Flextech and the BBC confirmed that they would give the first option for the transmission of up to five of the digital channels to BkyB and its partners. BSkyB has linked up with Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc to form British Digital Broadcasting in a bid for licences to operate up to three, domestic, multi-channel digital frequencies. Flextech, which simultaneously reported flat annual pretax, pre-exceptional losses of 16.8 million pounds, is buying out pay-TV channels UK Gold and UK Living by issuing 34.95 million shares to owners media groups Pearson, America's Cox Communications Group and BBC Worldwide. The deal is worth about 269.9 million pounds and values UK Gold at about 210.1 million pounds and UK Living at 104 million pounds. In return, Cox, Pearson and BBC Worldwide will take a 13.3, 5.6 and 3.5 percent stake respectively in Flextech. TINTA, meanwhile, says it will fulfil Flextech's financial obligations to the principal joint venture ""in certain circumstances"" if Flextech fails to do so.

"AT&amp;T Corp. said Thursday it withdrew its application with the U.S. government for a license to launch a new generation of communications satellites. AT&amp;T's decision to cancel its application to the Federal Communications Commission follows the disposal of several of its existing satellite businesses in recent months, completing its exit from the satellite operations business. In a statement, the New York-based company said investment in the new Ka-band satellite technology was a drain on capital resources that did not fit with a renewed focus on its core long-distance business and key growth areas like wireless, online and local services. Ka-band refers to radio frequencies that handle two-way voice and data communications. The Ka-band satellites would hover in place in a geostationary orbit instead of circling the Earth. The new class of satellites would have allowed AT&amp;T to offer a range of next-generation communications services such as video, data transmission and high-speed Internet services. ""We are focusing on our core business and some growth areas, and satellites is not core to that,"" AT&amp;T spokesman Gary Morgenstern said, adding that the company was not withdrawing from the satellite business completely. AT&amp;T continues to offer satellite-based services through its minority investment in the Direct TV direct broadcast satellite venture of Hughes Electronics Corp. AT&amp;T's Ka-band project was formally known to the industry as the AT&amp;T VoiceSpan Satellite System. The company said about 50 employees are engaged in the VoiceSpan project and that it would attempt to reassign them. In April, General Electric Co.'s GE Spacenet unit agreed to buy AT&amp;T's Very Small Aperture Terminal satellite operations for an undisclosed amount. In March, AT&amp;T sold its Skynet Satellite Services unit to Loral Space &amp; Commmunications Ltd. for $478 milion. AT&amp;T also collected roughly $130 million on an insurance claim for one of its satellites which it lost in space in January. The sale of the existing satellite operations means AT&amp;T no longer directly owns any communications satellites. In addition, AT&amp;T recently agreed to dispose of its undersea communications cable unit -- another operation it had considered low on its list of priorities -- to Tyco International Ltd. in a deal worth about $850 million. A dozen companies, including Hughes, Loral Space, and the international satellite consortium Intelsat have announced plans to compete in the Ka-band satellite market. Satellites offering such high-speed communications services are not expected to be launched until the year 2000. ","EricAuchard"
"The Prague Stock Exchange continued to gain ground on Thursday, but analysts said they were not convinced the beleaguered bourse's fortunes had turned around, attributing the rise to thin domestic buying. The bourse has showed signs of rebounding recently -- gaining in 15 of the past 16 sessions. But analysts saw little change in market sentiment amid mostly domestic trading as investment funds settled positions before the end of the year. ""This doesn't really look like a rebound to me. (Mainly) there's a bit of domestic buying and some of the local brokers are just bidding up the market,"" Alex Angell of the brokerage Wood and Company said. The PX50 index closed up 0.56 percent at 521.1 at its daily price fixing on Thursday, putting the bourse about nine percent higher than its low in mid-November. The PSE stumbled through most of the autumn, losing close to 20 percent as key investors sold positions, tired of a market characterised as unregulated and murky. Although eastern Europe's most-capitalised bourse, the Czech market has long been plagued by poor legislation that investors say fails to provide protection for minority shareholders. Under the Czech Republic's Securities Act, devised to handle the logistics of the government's massive voucher privatisation scheme, the Securities Registry (SCP) is bound by law to provide services such as moving securities to and from client accounts. Since the SCP does not reveal any details of transactions, including prices and volumes, local brokers have taken to the SCP because of its privacy and faster settlement process. But this has restrained activity on the PSE which sees on average $4-6 million of stock turnover each day, compared with $15 million in Warsaw, a much smaller market. ""There are clearly investors who have decided to stay away from this market because of its opaqueness and are still on the sidelines,"" said one international trader. ""This is the case especially at the end of the year when a lot of local funds push prices all over the place in order to get a desired result on their books for the year,"" he added. But many analysts said that hope is not lost for the bourse. They expected investors to buy back into the market as the downtrend bottoms out, although maybe not before the end of the year. ""I expect most of the buying to come in the New Year, but I think it means that investors already familiar with the market should do something now,"" said Danial Gladis, head of the brokerage Atlantik Financni Trhy. Market officials have also begun taking steps to correct the problems which should slowly lure back disenchanted investors. In April, parliament approved a series of market reforms to compel companies and fund managers to be more open and accountable. A key element tackles the chronic problem of slow and irregular reporting of company earnings and actions. The PSE itself has taken several steps to brings more transparency to the market, stressing in particular the need for the early creation of an independent watchdog, though analysts said a lack of political will to establish the body remains.

"Toronto stocks ended weaker on Thursday, extending Wednesday's sharp losses despite a strong rally in heavyweight gold issues. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index lost 13.97 points to finish at 6187.46. The key index fell 46 points on Wednesday. ""It would have been a lot worse if not for the gain in gold,"" said International MMS analyst Katherine Beattie. Toronto's gold and precious metals group soared 2.85 percent after bullion prices rose in both London and New York metal markets. Trading was brisk with 114.9 million shares changing hands worth C$2.04 billion ($1.5 billion). North American markets on Thursday continued to digest the negative comments on stock prices made by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday. Greenspan cautioned that the stock markets might be overvalued and the risk of rising inflation could prompt a tightening in short-term interest rates. ""I think people are taking Greenspan's comments seriously,"" Beattie said. Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 11 groups lost ground led by media, utilities, conglomerates and transportation. The three strong sectors were golds, base metals and real estate. Declining issues outnumbered advances 520 to 472. Another 289 traded flat.

"Harnischfeger Industries Inc's $19 a share tender offer for industrial tool and systems maker Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc could be about the best offer Giddings can get, industry analysts said Monday. ""I don't think there's much more in that Harnischfeger bid than what's in there, and I don't think there's anyone else out there"" that would make a higher bid, Thomas Burns Jr., analyst at NatWest Securities, said.   Shares of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based Giddings &amp; Lewis jumped 6-3/4 to 20-3/8 Monday. That was seen as an indication that some buyers expect a higher bid, a view many analysts take issue with. ""My feeling is at $19 a share, that's full value, I think, for Giddings &amp; Lewis,"" said William Cooke, analyst at McDonald &amp; Co. ""I think that Harnischfeger is assuming they can double the earnings of Giddings &amp; Lewis in the not too distant future. I think they're being optimistic.""   Harnischfeger said it is looking at using Giddings &amp; Lewis to expand in the fragmented industrial products aftermarket service business, which Harnischfeger estimates as an $80 billion market. But some analysts said buying Giddings &amp; Lewis, a company that took a $64.1 million charge last year to try to fix its integrated automation systems business, adds a lot of uncertainty for Harnischfeger shareholders.   ""...we believe that investors will be looking at a fundamentally different company with much more risk involved than they had previously,"" J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth, wrote in a research note, in which he also lowered the rating of Harnischfeger to a hold from a buy. While saying the Harnischfeger bid was not a done deal, ""we expect (Harnischfeger) to pursue its target with vigor and would be suprised if another offer significantly higher than the one now on the table would surface,"" Brumley said.   Some analysts said Harnischfeger has picked a perfect time to go after Giddings &amp; Lewis. Giddings has already taken steps to fix its underperforming operations, but the stock, in their opinion, still is ailing, they said. ""They got all the dirty work behind them,"" said Darren Bagwell, analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co Inc. ""They've wiped the slate clean, and yet the stock price still reflects that wait and see attitude."" In fact, Bagwell also said Giddings &amp; Lewis could probably squeeze a higher bid out of somebody and said he felt the company was worth more than $19 a share. Some analysts also noted that Harnischfeger's bid was likely based only on publicly available information and that a bidder who had a good look at Giddings &amp; Lewis books might find information to convince them to make a higher offer. Harnischfeger shares were down 3-5/8 at 41-3/4 Monday. ((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787)) ","BradDorfman"
"Ordinarily seated at the rear of a courtroom, behind deep ranks of dark-suited corporate lawyers fighting anti-cigarette lawsuits, is the mystified legal defender of Dosal Tobacco Co. ""What am I doing here?"" Jose Martinez often asks as he fidgets through yet another courtroom hearing in one of the high-profile tobacco cases heading for trial. Martinez, of the Miami law firm Martinez, Gutierrez &amp; DeCordoba, puts that question to judges and to plaintiff attorneys pressing lawsuits on behalf of sick smokers, non-smokers claiming injuries from other people's cigarette fumes and the State of Florida, which is seeking tobacco money for Medicaid costs. ""We're just a small manufacturer, a family operation. We shouldn't be here,"" Martinez insists to anyone who will listen. Dosal -- now swept up in one of the great legal battles of the century -- is a tiny family-owned company based in Opa-Locka, a poor city north of Miami built by a real estate developer with a fanciful taste for Moorish architecture. It makes but a few million cigarettes a year -- compared with Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the largest cigarette maker in the world, which last year shipped nearly 231 billion cigarettes in the United States alone. Still, Dosal's name appears in three anti-tobacco lawsuits in Florida and another in Michigan, along with deep-pocketed giants such as RJR Nabisco Holdings and Philip Morris, which last year had more than $35 billion in tobacco sales. Dosal's main customer is the Florida prison system, which sells Dosal's DTC brand cigarettes in regular and king-sized lengths to the smokers among the state's 50,000 inmates. Even so, Dosal is named in the state's lawsuit against tobacco companies. Dosal also makes a brand or two favoured by elderly Cuban emigres in south Florida, including Competidora. ""They buy bulk tobacco and make cigarettes on machines in Opa-Locka. It's a very small operation,"" Martinez said. ""And the customers for the Cuban brands are old and dying."" Good-humoured and joking much of the time, Martinez is deadly serious about eliminating the legal threat to Dosal. In addition to filing formal requests that Dosal be dropped, he presses plaintiff lawyers informally with arguments on the futility of suing a company with limited financial resources. ""I ask every day,"" Martinez says. If kept in the lawsuits, including the so-called Broin class-action suit scheduled to go to trial Monday in Miami, Dosal could be made to pay a share of any monetrary judgment. The lawyers pressing the Broin case intend to ask for $5 billion or more in damages. And while the tobacco industry has yet to pay out a dollar in court damages after four decades of litigation, leaks in the industry's defences are widely seen on Wall Street and elsewhere. The Broin case, being brought on behalf of an estimated 60,000 ailing and non-smoking flight attendants by lawyers Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt, is the first of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits coming to trial this year against U.S. cigarette makers. ""It's their fault,"" Martinez said, pointing to the Rosenblatts during a courtroom interview this week after a hearing in the Broin case, filed more than six years ago. ""All the other suits copied theirs."" Martinez said the Rosenblatts, who have named 10 defendants in the Broin lawsuit, were also responsible for the Michigan anti-tobacco lawsuit which has targeted Dosal and other cigarette makers. ""I don't think we have even sold any cigarettes in Michigan,"" Martinez said. ","MichaelConnor"
"The bidding war for Conrail Inc. appears to be drawing to a close, but big legal and regulatory battles are right around the corner. Industry analysts said Friday rival bidders CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. were unlikely to offer much more for Philadelphia-based Conrail, but both sides will pursue the fight in court, before regulators and in the marketplace. ""That is the whole process that takes place over the course of 1997 -- the battle for market share as opposed to Conrail shares,"" said Anthony Hatch, analyst at NatWest Securities Corp. CSX, based in Richmond, Va., on Thursday raised its offer for Conrail to give shareholders an extra $870 million in a friendly cash-and-stock merger. Based on Friday's stock activity, the deal is worth $9.3 billion, or about $102 per Conrail share. A source close to CSX told Reuters on Thursday that CSX and Conrail hoped the revised deal would end the bidding war. But just hours after CSX and Conrail unveiled the new terms of their planned merger, Norfolk Southern raised its all-cash offer by $500 million to about $10.5 billion, or $115 a share. ""If someone were to start to bid higher than this, they probably wouldn't get the economies out of the deal to make it work so the bidding war, I think, has come to the end,"" said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group. Although Norfolk Southern's bid has been higher throughout the two-month takeover fight, Conrail contends the union with CSX is a better strategic fit. Industry experts said Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, which has the financial power to bid more than $10.5 billion, merely wants to preserve the spread between the two offers while it fights a key aspect of the Conrail-CSX pact in court. Norfolk Southern is challenging part of the transaction that prohibits either CSX or Conrail from seeking another merger partner before 1999. Some analysts and investors said that if the exclusivity provision is not thrown out after a Jan. 9 hearing in federal judge in Philadelphia, it could guarantee a victory for CSX because shareholders could not wait two years for a deal with Norfolk Southern. Norfolk Southern last month lost a court fight in which it challenged previous terms of the deal, including an exclusivity provision that ruled out other talks before July 1997. ""This is a sign that they're not going to go bananaas (with a very high offer). If they're able to break the lock-up provision, they have a good bid,"" Hatch said. ""It was the right thing to do to keep pressure on the (Conrail) board,"" said one takeover stock trader, referring to investors who were unhappy with the Conrail board's decision to pursue the lower of the two bids. The court case is expected to hinge on whether Conrail's agreeing to the extended exclusivity period is within the broad discretion allowed a board under Pennsylvania law, said Charles Yablon, a professor of corporate law at Cardozo University in New York. ""They're pushing the outside of the envelope and trying to take maximum advantage of the leeway that Pennsylvania law gives them,"" Yablon said. But if they can legally justify the move, CSX will probably prevail, he said. Few analysts were predicting the outcome, but the war was expected to continue no matter which company wins in court. After the court fight, the next battle site will be Washington where the losing bidder is expected to vehemently challenge the merger. The deal already is expected to face intense scrutiny from the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that oversees railroads. ""You're going to have a lot of opposition to this,"" PNC's Vincent said, citing railroads, shippers and state agencies that are expected to express their opinions when the transaction reaches the regulatory stage. Last week, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it would intervene in any merger involving Conrail. Conrail stock fell 87.5 cents to $99.875 trading on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock fell 50 cents to $43.25 and Norfolk Southern shares rose $1.125 to $89.50, also on NYSE. ","RobinSidel"
"Britain's Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday it had become involved in a probe into alleged irregularities at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, the funds arm of Deutsche Bank's UK-based investment bank. A spokeswoman for the SFO said the office was in contact with British investment watchdog IMRO, which would share any relevant material with the office. The SFO investigates and prosecutes major financial crimes in the City of London. IMRO's own probe into MGAM has already led to the suspension of two fund managers and briefly saw trading halted in three MGAM funds, which have around 90,000 small investors. ""We have been in contact with IMRO. IMRO are investigating and will share anything of relevance with us,"" the SFO spokeswoman told Reuters. Trading in the three funds resumed on Thursday after a 180 million pound ($280 million) bail-out by parent company Deutsche Bank. Sources in both the British banking and fund management industries said the probe appeared to be focusing on links between suspended MGAM fund manager Peter Young and a UK-based broker, Fiba Nordic Securities. Young was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Fiba Nordic Securities in London said the firm welcomed any investigation and denied any improper relationship with MGAM. Fiba Nordic Securities has been a broker and valuer for funds managed by MGAM. British regulatory sources said the UK's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) had previously been examining the activities of Fiba over another matter. This had subsequently led to the investigation by IMRO into MGAM which prompted Young's suspension. Young, whose own assets were frozen as a result of a high court injunction late on Wednesday, was suspended from MGAM on Monday. MGAM announced on Wednesday evening that a second manager, Stewart Armer, had also been suspended. Young had managed two of the three suspended funds. MGAM said Armer was suspended on Wednesday evening ""following the discovery of a suspected breach of personal account dealing rules"". A source close to the investigation said Armer's assets would not be frozen and he was not a central focus of the probe. Armer was not available for comment. But in Frankfurt a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said neither Young nor Armer had committed an obvious breach of regulations. ""But both were hovering on the brink of a grey area,"" spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf told Reuters. According to sources close to the investigation, the probe is trying to determine whether the fund's investments in unquoted stocks were valued above their real worth. British brokers said they had had few redemptions in the three Morgan Grenfell funds after trading in them resumed but the full extent of any exodus would only become apparent after a few weeks. ""We are not seeing any panic selling. Redemption levels look modest at this stage,"" an MGAM spokesman told Reuters. However, banking analysts in Frankfurt said Deutsche had to tighten up internal controls to prevent a repeat crisis at its UK fund management division. ""Something like this can never be allowed to happen again. If Deutsche really wants to be a global player in investment banking, then its control mechanisms must keep in step with its growth,"" said Vereinsbank analyst Natalia Grasegger. The fall-out from the MGAM investigation also spread to Sweden, where Young had invested substantially in unlisted stocks. Stocks held in his portfolio fell amid concerns from Swedish officials about the impact of the probe on the country's alternative stock market. ($1=.6373 Pound) ","AlexanderSmith"
"Foreign lenders owed money by members of China's chaotic investment trust house sector risk an unpredictable official response in the case of default or collapse, rating agency Moody's Investors Service has warned. Regulators struggling to rein in wayward trust houses were unlikely to rush to rescue those that failed, the agency said in a report issued just days after the central bank announced the closure of one of China's largest investment firms. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, announced last week it had shut down the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC) because of serious illegal and irregular business practices that had caused it huge losses. ""Moody's believes that regulatory support for institutions in trouble... will continue to be unpredictable, and will overall be less likely to be forthcoming from the central bank in the future,"" the agency said. ""Where little public interest is involved, it is probable that the central regulators would not be active in encouraging or financing a rescue, preferring a default in an attempt to impose some order on an increasingly chaotic system,"" it said. The central bank's lack of political clout in dealing with the trust houses, some of which were mere speculative vehicles for powerful institutional sponsors, had resulted in a selective approach to dealing with their problems, it said. Foreign lenders had so far been mostly repaid after the reported closure of more than 100 non-bank financial institutions in recent months, but such a policy was far from guaranteed, it said. China has yet to announce detailed plans for creditors to CADTIC, which was backed by the Ministry of Agriculture, but analysts have suggested that at least some foreign companies with outstanding loans might lose out. The central bank said repayment priority would be given to domestic individual creditors, with other lenders to be repaid after the liquidation of what was China's biggest trust after the China International Trust and Investment Corp (CITIC). CADTIC's collapse highlighted the difficulties Beijing faces in policing the financial sector while managing the transition from strict central planning to the new market-style economy. Regulators were likely to take a more supportive approach towards problems among China's largest state banks than towards those encountered by the trust houses, Moody's said. The big four state banks -- the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China -- already received a great deal of government support on a daily basis, the agency said. The banks would all be insolvent if their loan values were written down to reflect impairment, but resolution of this problem would require a complete restructuring of the state sector as well as bank recapitalisation, it said. While China's other large commercial banks had much sounder finances, official support for them in the event of problems was uncertain, Moody's said. Regulators could well tolerate the failure of a large bank if it was deemed to be the result of imprudence, illegality or incompetence, while struggling small banks were unlikely to receive any support at all, it said.

"World bankers and economic chiefs held Hong Kong up as a financial showcase with a rosy future on Friday but a clash of views between Britain and China over democracy augured a politically bumpy ride. Finance ministers and central bankers gathered in the glitzy Grand Hyatt Hotel beside Hong Kong's famed ""Fragrant Harbour"", boosting the morale of the financial sector less than four months before China takes over the British-ruled territory. At the same time, tearful colonial expatriates were about to set sail or were already on their way home on two of the world's greatest cruise liners, the QE2 and the Oriana, a dramatic reminder that an era is ending and that Hong Kong itself will soon be sailing in uncharted waters. China is taking back the territory of 6.4 million people, which has prospered under the British flag for more than 150 years, at midnight on June 30. China, in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, promised the outpost great autonomy and a free rein to capitalism -- hailed by the financial community as a harbinger of stability and further prosperity. But much of that stability depends in large measure on the outcome of clashing views over how much democracy there should be. China plans to scrap -- at least temporarily -- Hong Kong's elected legislature and roll back civil liberties. The titans of the financial world were treated to a taste of the future on Friday, as democracy activists protested outside the nearby police headquarters to demand prosecution of a pro-China politician for setting up an ""illegal"" office. And in Beijing, China's foreign minister issued a snub to Britain, dismissing London's opposition to a plan to disband Hong Kong's legislature, saying this would not affect the smooth transfer of power. International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Michel Camdessus voiced confidence that Hong Kong, one of the world's richest cities, would keep its financial autonomy under Chinese rule. Camdessus held up Hong Kong as a shining example of fiscal success thanks to prudent monetary and exchange rate policy. He told the IMF-Hong Kong Monetary Authority conference China had a stake in preserving that success. ""History, geographic location, openness in trade and importance as a financial centre all point to its critical interest in continued global integration, an interest that is shared in China, in the region and in the rest of the world,"" he said. But colonial Governor Chris Patten warned that the Hong Kong miracle was due to increasingly democratic government, and that freedom should not be tampered with. ""Democracy, as promised and pledged in the Joint Declaration and in the Basic Law (mini constitution), has taken root and started to flourish here. This has strongly underpinned Hong Kong's economic prosperity and Hong Kong's social stability,"" Patten said. China's central bank governor Dai Xianglong took a different view. Hong Kong's prosperity depended on China. ""As China moves ahead in its modernisation drive, the prosperity of Hong Kong will be even more secure,"" he said. Pledging that London would keep a close eye on basic freedoms in Hong Kong after the handover, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said Hong Kong's prosperity hinged on the survival of its British-based rule of law, wise economic policies and transparent government. ""As a signatory of the Joint Declaration, we will continue to take a close interest in ensuring that Hong Kong's economic achievements, and the rights and freedoms which underpin them are fully preserved,"" he said. Qian signalled China would not budge from its plan to install a legislature in place of the elected Legco and said foreign countries should not meddle in post-colonial Hong Kong. ""If they (British authorities) continue to voice their opposition to the operation of the provisional Legislative Council I don't think it will have any impact on the smooth transition of Hong Kong,"" he said. ""No foreign country has the right to interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."" Most Hong Kong expatriates leaving on the cruise liners, cutting careers short due to ""localisation"" of top government jobs, said they did not expect to be coming back. ""There will be tears at leaving my second home,"" said senior law draftsman Royston Griffey, who helped draft Patten's democratic reforms. ""But I will probably wave a fist at the government for treating an overseas officer so disgracefully."" ""It's like leaving an old friend when you are not sure when you are going to see them again,"" said former welfare director Ian Strachan. ""Hong Kong has been such an important part of my life.""

"Sterling Software Inc's $165 million purchase of Texas Instruments Inc software unit will close on June 14 and will help Sterling's financials almost immediately, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday.   ""Three or four minutes,"" Sterling Williams told Reuters when asked how long Sterling Software would spend integrating Texas Instrument's 1,300 staff and 62 facilities around the world. ""It will enhance both profits and revenues almost immediately,"" Williams said. Williams also said Sterling Software's cash holdings, enlarged greatly by last fall's spinoff of Sterling Commerce Inc, remain largely intact after the Texas Instruments' deal and will be used to pay for more acquisitions.   Founded in 1981 and with more than two dozen acquisitions to its credit, the company will have some $600 million in cash after the Texas Instruments' check is written, Williams said. ""The biggest opportunities out there are in applications software,"" Williams said. ""Size doesn't attract or repel us.""   Applications software groups, such as the Texas Instruments' business Sterling is buying, help design new software for big organizations and cobble together different computer systems. Sterling is also interested in companies which produce software for big computer systems, Williams said.   The Texas Instruments' acquisition announced a month ago will add $250 million in annual revenues to Sterling Software and better than double to half the portion of Sterling Software revenues which come from applications software operations, Williams said. Sterling had fiscal 1996 revenues of about $440 million.   Williams said Sterling Software's top executives had spent the past month meeting TI Software's managers around the world and had clear, detailed plans for weaving the unit into Sterling. He said cost savings would come through cuts in research and administration and that layoffs would likely be minimal. The combined sales forces would allow broader marketing of Sterling Software's products and services, he said. ""Our ramp up basically takes place before the announcement,"" he said. ""But there is a settling-in phase where you make course corrections.""   The combination would stimulate sales growth in Sterling's applications operations, which had been flat in fiscal 1996 after fast growth in the early 1990s, Williams said. He declined to discuss detailed forecasts. TI's customers will be largely new ones for Sterling and acceptance of the deal among customers seems to be good, Williams said. ""Not a single customer called and said he was worried,"" he said. Sterling Software shares rose 5/8  and closed at 32-1/4. ((--Miami newsroom, 305-374-5013)) ","MichaelConnor"
"Four companies have approached Angeion Corp about becoming distribution partners with the Plymouth, Minn.-based medical devices maker, chief executive Whitney McFarlin said. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, McFarlin said. ""We have four very real potential partners, two domestic and two international. We believe there will be an investment made in our company by one or more of these companies.""   Angeion shares have slumped since last spring on a series of events that analysts say have left it looking like an also-ran in the fast-growing, $500 million market for implantable defibrillators, or ICDs -- small electronic devices placed in the body and wired to the heart to keep it from beating too fast. ""This whole issue of uncertainty has clearly impacted our stock.... But we're positioned to be a fourth player in this market,"" McFarlin said, speaking at a Raymond James investors conference here. ""Don't count Angeion out.""   The ICD market is dominated by Guidant Corp, Medtronic Inc and Ventritex Inc, which has agreed to be acquired by St. Jude Medical Inc. St. Jude had been Angeion's distribution partner, but the two companies are in the process of separating. Medtronic in November won an arbitration decision awarding it access to certain Angeion patents. McFarlin said Angeion and St. Jude are still in negotiations, but he expects to complete the divorce this month. ""We're going to come out of it very reasonably,"" he said.   Angeion, which is selling ICDs in Europe, had revenues of $3 million in its fiscal year ended July 31. McFarlin said the company expects revenues in its current fiscal year in the area of $8 million. ""I don't see a lot of impact from a strategic partner this fiscal year,"" McFarlin said. The company expects to file a product marketing application this summer with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its Sentinel 2000 and Sentinel 2010 and related lead systems, McFarlin said.   A supplemental application for its Sentinel 2020 is expected to follow shortly later, he said. Angeion's stock has also been weighed down by a securities fraud case stemming from 1991 and involving a group of stockbrokers who manipulated Angeion's share price. ""That was done by a group of outside brokers and has nothing to do with the company.... There is no exposure, but every time another story comes out, it says 'Angeion.' It drives me to distraction,"" McFarlin said. ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"China on Monday crowed over an economic triumph in restraining inflation while retaining strong growth in 1996, and said it expected to do even better next year despite soaring state sector losses and slumping incomes. China's gross domestic product was estimated to have grown 9.7 percent in 1996 to 6,780 billion yuan ($816 billion), with inflation slashed to 6.0 percent from 14.8 percent in 1995, the State Statistical Bureau quoted preliminary figures as showing. Despite soaring losses in the lumbering state sector and falling incomes for many urban households, the statistics showed China's economy had returned safely to earth after a period of high-inflation runaway growth, said bureau spokesman Ye Zhen. ""The national economy maintained its rapid and stable growth, indicating a successful 'soft landing',"" Ye told a news conference in Beijing. China would do even better in 1997, he said. ""Preliminary estimates show overall growth will continue with the same stability and high speed as this year,"" he said. Annual economic growth in 1997 was expected to rise to 10.5 percent, while inflation -- which soared to a communist-era high of 21.4 percent in 1994 -- would stay at this year's level, Ye said. China had set a target of 8.0 percent growth for 1996 to try to cool the economy, down from 10.2 percent last year and a sizzling 11.8 percent the previous year. The 6.0 percent figure for 1996 retail price inflation, China's benchmark price index, was well below the government's 10 percent target for the year. Consumer price inflation was estimated at about 8.3 percent, compared with 17.1 percent in 1995. While some economists have expressed doubts about the accuracy of Beijing's inflation figures, it was clear that once-fierce price rises had been largely controlled, said Jason Kwok, chief economist at Citibank Hong Kong and China. ""It all tends to suggest that the macro-economy is doing very well this year,"" Kwok said in a telephone interview. Two recent interest rate cuts and China's second-half turnaround of an earlier poor export performance meant growth could edge up next year even without a loosening of Beijing's 42-month-old tight credit policy, Kwok said. Stable growth next year was likely to receive an external boost from an expected upward trend in exports, which the statistical bureau said had powered China to an estimated $16 billion trade surplus in 1996, he said. Beijing would keep the lid on credit growth and continue to put high priority on restraining price rises, Ye said. Some economists have suggested Beijing's success in reducing inflation and the two cuts in interest rates this year signal an imminent easing of the credit crunch, which has thrown a heavy burden on the already struggling state enterprises. About 75 percent of state firms were losing money and total losses in the government sector had soared to 69 billion yuan between January and October, a rise of 45 percent compared with the same period of last year, Ye said. ""Although the situation improved after the second quarter, in general the problems remain very serious,"" he said. Per capita incomes in urban households had risen 3.4 percent in real terms to 4,380 yuan in 1996, but the figures hid an income decline for many families, bureau officials said. Incomes had failed to keep pace with inflation in about 30 percent of households, although for some, the retirement or death of a main wage earner rather than macro-economics were the main culprit, they said.

"An unemployed Taiwanese journalist on Monday doused himself with petrol aboard a Taiwan airliner and hijacked the plane to China where he requested political asylum, officials said. The Boeing 757 airliner, carrying 150 passengers and six crew, was on its way back to Taiwan after landing safely in the southeastern city of Xiamen. Chinese police said the suspect, identified by Taiwan as Liu Shan-chung, 45, was being held in Xiamen for questioning. ""The hijacker wants political asylum,"" an airport official said by telephone. An executive of Far East Air Transport, the operator of the hijacked Taiwanese airliner, told reporters the man who forced Flight 128 to fly to China said he faced political repression in Taiwan. ""The hijacker told the captain 'I am a victim of political repression',"" said Lee Yun-ning, general manager of Far East Air Transport, speaking in Taipei. Taiwan demanded China return the suspect, saying it had the right to put him on trial. ""We have legal jurisdiction,"" Taiwan Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao said hours after the plane crossed the Taiwan Strait and touched down in Xiamen. ""The mainland authorities should return the hijacker immediately."" Chinese officials did not say how they would deal with the suspect. Hijacking is a capital offence but commandeering an aircraft from China's arch rival Taiwan would be determined by political considerations as well as legal guidelines, lawyers said. China and Taiwan have been rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 when the Nationalists fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the communists. The Taiwan airliner was on a scheduled flight from the island's southern city of Kaohsiung to Taipei when it changed course and headed for the China mainland. Liu had doused himself with petrol and forced the pilot to change course, Taiwanese authorities said. Liu worked briefly as a journalist for the east Taiwan newspaper Lientung Daily after being fired a year ago from Kaohsiung's The Commons Daily for discipline problems, his former employers said. In Taiwan, Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling said four Taiwan fighters had scrambled into an escort formation and tailed the plane part of the way across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan defence officials decided not to intercept the flight to avoid a military ""misunderstanding"" with China's People's Liberation Army, a defence official told Reuters. The last hijacking of a Taiwanese airliner to China was in May 1986, when the pilot of a Boeing 747 cargo plane owned by Taiwan's flag carrier China Airlines commandeered the jet and flew it to Guangzhou. Beijing returned the plane and two crew members who did not want to stay in China after talks between the two rivals in Hong Kong. China endured a rash of 12 hijackings in 1993 and 1994 by Chinese who ordered pilots to fly them to Taiwan for political asylum. Air piracy fell off sharply after Beijing launched a major drive to improve what had been lax security at most airports. ","WilliamKazer"
"Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever NV/Plc Tuesday reported a 15 percent rise in pre-tax profits for 1996 and said it was putting its speciality chemicals businesses up for sale. Pre-tax profit rose to 2.66 billion pounds ($4.4 billion) on a 6 percent rise in revenues to 33.52 billion ($54.7 billion). 2. Unilever's stock surged on the results, which were better than the 53 billion pounds ($4.13 billion) analysts had forecast, and the planned sale of the speciality chemicals businesses. Chairman Niall FitzGerald said the overall economic situation in 1997 was likely to be generally favourable, as in 1996, but he warned about market conditions in Europe, particularly France and Germany. He said the planned sale of Unilever's speciality chemicals businesses would enable the company to concentrate on achieving growth in its consumer goods operations, particularly in developing and emerging markets. ""We will now seek actively buyers for the totality or the individual businesses and we will then assess those over the next month or two,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""We would hope to conclude a sale in the course of the next three to six months."" FitzGerald declined to say how much the businesses might be worth. The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have combined revenue of 3.0 billion pounds ($4.9 billion), 9 percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million pounds ($678 million) in 1996, with profit margins of 14.1 percent. ""These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses, but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require,"" FitzGerald said. ""They are essentially industrial businesses selling not to consumers but to intermediate customers. They are very fine businesses,"" he said. ""But if you look at the way this industry is developing, we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business, which is our mainstream consumer goods business."" The four companies together make up one of the world's largest speciality chemicals groups, employing 15,800 people in more than 35 countries. Unilever is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, and its activities span food, personal products, such as Pond's cold cream, and household goods brands, including laundry detergents and Lux soap. In Europe, Unilever's overall results in 1996 were held back by the impact of poor weather on ice cream sales and the impact of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy beef crisis. ""We see little reason, however, to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, will improve,"" FitzGerald said. Good progress in North American market conditions provided the basis for better results, and the momentum of growth continued strongly in the fast-growing emerging markets. ","TimFarrand"
"China's President Jiang Zemin issued a pledge on Saturday to outdo late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in pursuing the capitalist-style reforms that his patron vowed would carry China through the next 100 years. Jiang, who with Deng's death at 92 on Wednesday became undisputedly the most powerful man in China, waited a scant two days before hinting that ""the chief architect"" of reforms that have transformed the face of China in just 18 years had only started a job that he (Jiang) meant to finish. ""We would run China's undertakings still better, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, development and progress of the mankind,"" Jiang told visiting Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. To ordinary Chinese, Jiang's first public words following the death of the man credited with creating China's extraordinarily successful combination of communism and capitalism were an unmistakeable rebuke. ""Of course that's a criticism,"" said a Chinese worker without hesitation. However, Jiang was also swift to nail his colours to Deng's reforms and opening to the outside world that transformed an isolated Stalinist state into a fledgling economic superpower. Jiang, who is also China's Communist Party chief and the head of the military, was hand-picked by Deng to be his successor and holds most of the cards needed to replace him. But for some analysts, his swift attempt to assume Deng's personal mantle smacked of arrogance that could prove dangerous if a power struggle were to erupt. China's secretive leadership has projected an image of seamless transition following Deng's death, mindful of the political tumult that enveloped the country following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 before Deng emerged. But there were hints of discord even as the 92-year-old Deng lay dying. The February issue of a magazine called Zhongliu, or Mainstay, controlled by ultra-leftists, obliquely criticised Deng's successor in what one political analyst described as ""the first cannon fired by leftists at Jiang Zemin"". In China's arcane political world, power struggles are fought behind the scenes and traditionally emerge into the public eye only when they erupt in the state media. The language used by the magazine was reminiscent of the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that Mao used to purge his opponents, analysts said. ""The magazine is trying to stir up debate reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution... to oust Jiang Zemin,"" one said. Clearly fearing a repeat of the student-led demonstrations that marked the last funeral of a party luminary in 1989, police threw a security net around Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing and plainclothes officers patrolled university campuses. Deng's memorial rites are scheduled for Tuesday in the cavernous Great Hall of the People on the edge of the square. On Saturday, a People's Liberation Army honour guard rehearsed the cremation that is expected on Monday at a special cemetery for party heroes, shouldering a glass coffin with a live soldier inside -- apparently simulating China's late paramount leader. State television has run endless paeans to Deng and showed formal mourning activities organised by Chinese officials in Hong Kong, Washington and other foreign cities. At home, however, China has kept official reaction to Deng's death deliberately low-key, making little attempt to organise memorial activities that might spin out of control. In central Beijing's Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989 student-led protests smashed by the military at Deng's behest, at least two people have been detained while trying to pay final respects to the late leader. Tens of thousands of mourners thronged to the courtyard of his birth in his home village of Paifang in southwestern Sichuan province. In the Sichuan capital of Chengdu more than 10,000 people gathered in People's Square on Thursday to mark the passing of their province's favourite son. In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, a special economic zone near Hong Kong where Deng first experimented with grafting capitalist-style markets on to a socialist economy, hundreds of people filed past a giant Deng billboard which had been turned into a makeshift shrine. In Shanghai, which quickly reverted to its nimble trading ways under Deng's guidance, the city's familier profit mantra was joined by a new chant drifting skyward from the Jade Buddha Temple. ""The monks are praying for world peace and Deng Xiaoping,"" an attendant said. ""So that Deng will go to heaven."" ","JaneMacartney"
"Muhammad Yunus may have the travel itinerary and packed schedule of an international banker, but that is where the comparisons stop. He does not wear a banker's pinstripes, but the traditional, billowing Bangladeshi panjami. He eschews five-star hotels and stays instead with friends and supporters around the world. Yet Yunus is Bangladesh's most successful banker, a man who has gained international renown for doing the unthinkable. Yunus is head of Grameen Bank, which makes money out of lending money to some of the world's poorest people. Ninety-four percent of Grameen's borrowers are women, and the bank makes loans to people with no collateral or credit rating. To the traditional banker this may sound like financial suicide, but Grameen has attracted more than two million customers since it started in 1976 and its lending philosophy has spread to over 50 countries. Yunus, founder and managing director of Grameen Bank, says his strategy works -- 98 percent of loans get repaid, a banker's dream, and most borrowers escape from their poverty trap. ""Our goal is to take the poor people out of poverty as many ways as possible,"" Yunus said during a visit to Australia to meet Grameen supporter groups and politicans. Some of the world's biggest bankers are now listening to Yunus's cry against poverty. The World Bank has appointed him chairman of its policy advisory group in its lending programmes to the poor. The world's first Micro-Credit Summit, held last month in Washington, set out to ensure that 100 million of the world's poorest families, especially women, receive credit by the year 2005. A large part of the credit programmes will be based on policies used by the Grameen Bank, which is 92 percent owned by its borrowers. The rest is owned by the Bangladesh government. The formation two years ago of CGAP (the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest), with the financial backing of the World Bank and European Commission, is an endorsement by the World Bank of Yunus's vision. The CGAP has a budget of $291 million to set up micro-lending banks around the world. Yunus wants to make sure all of this money reaches the people that need it and that it is not chewed up by bureaucracy. ""We are saying exactly $291 million should reach the hands of the poor people and you make the minimum out of service charges and we are suggesting a mechanism to do that,"" he said. ""Most of the aid money gets dried up in the servicing of the aid. I am not blaming the bureaucracy itself. I am simply saying the design is wrong,"" said the former economics professor. The world aid system also has its faults, Yunus said in an interview before a public lecture to a packed unversity audience. If he is not giving lectures in foreign countries he is receiving prizes or honorary degress and meeting supporters. Each year about $60 billion is given in aid by the World Bank and other government agencies, but these funds fail to meet their market -- the poor, Yunus said. This aid has been given to large infrastructure projects on the trickle-down economic theory rationale, but these do not create sustainable employment, said the U.S.-educated banker. Yunus' idea for Grameen Bank came when he returned to newly-independent Bangladesh in 1972 to become head of the economics department at Chittagong University. He found that the theories he was teaching were not working -- just outside the university walls people lived in squalor. Almost half of Bangladesh's 112 million people live below the poverty line and about 68 percent of the population are illiterate. The 57-year-old banker knew that poverty was not due to laziness or lack of intelligence but a lack of capital needed for agriculture or industry. Grameen Bank now has a staff of 12,600 who visit 36,000 of Bangladesh's 68,000 villages each week to meet their 2.1 million customers. In 1996 the bank loaned about $400 million with the average loan at $150. The bank has two loans -- a one-year self employment loan and a 10-year housing loan. ""It (capital) is a very important part of alleviating poverty, but it is not the only one,"" said Yunus, who has been mentioned as a possible future Nobel Peace Prize winner. ""But other pieces become easier to fit in when you have created this centrepiece, then you can add the health piece, you can add education,"" said Yunus, who also plans to provide health care insurance, solar heating and cellular telephone services to Grameen customers. ""Our goal is to get these 2.1 million families out of poverty in the next five years in Bangladesh,"" Yunus said. ""Worldwide we shall look for a day when all the poor people are out of poverty... If it can be done in Bangladesh with 2.1 million families, it can be done worldwide. It is just a question of will."" ","KevinMorrison"
"A year after the ValuJet Inc. crash, the top airline regulator suggested Thursday it would be impractical to force air carriers to install fire-safety equipment in passenger cargo holds in less than three years. Under fire for not moving more quickly to promote airline safety, the Federal Aviation Administration plans next month to propose the installation of smoke detectors and fire supressers in all passenger cargo holds over three years. House lawmakers, however, accused the agency of dragging its feet on the installation issue, despite years of warnings from safety regulators on the need to do so. Lawmakers raised the possibility of a speedier timetable. ""It could be done in a very short period of time if we want to ground the fleet,"" Barry Valentine, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told a House panel. ""That's the decision. How much disruption do we citizens want to have in our air transportation,"" he said. But Representative John Fox, a Pennsylvania Republican, responded, ""I think we want to have as safe as flights as possible. And if they have to be a little slower, the public probably would like them to be a little slower."" Airline executives on Wednesday announced plans to place both smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in their aircraft, after initially balking at the dual requirement. FAA officials came under attack at the hearing -- from both lawmakers and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -- for not moving more aggressively to implement new safety rules in the wake of the ValuJet crash. ""This is pathetic. The FAA is pathetic. The industry is pathetic,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat. ""Any more needless deaths and we're going to crucify you."" The FAA announced six months ago plans to issue the fire-safety equipment rules, which will affect about 3,000 aircraft. But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal. ""Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we're in today? Or is there really going to be improvement this time?"" asked Representative John Duncan, a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee. Valentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the ""final assembly."" ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May, killing 110 people, because of a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners. The head of the NTSB disclosed this week, however, that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident. NTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident. Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24. ""It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week. You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place, that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States,"" Hall said. An FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB. ","RogerFillion"
"The nation's retailers are expected to post modest sales gains for February, with warm weather during the month having a mixed impact on results, analysts said Tuesday. Analysts said retailers are expected to post a rise of about 4 percent in sales from stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, for February. ""While warm weather, particularly in the Northeast, did boost sales of apparel at many retailers, it depressed sales in some hardline areas,"" analysts at Merrill Lynch said in a research note. Most retailers are scheduled to report their February sales results Thursday morning, though Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. reported Monday that its same-store sales rose 8.2 percent for the month. ""Carsons had a strong reading, which might be a tell-tale sign for some of the smaller retailers,"" said Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. One retailer that has exceeded the industry average in recent months, Sears, Roebuck and Co., is expected to fall back to the pack, with gains of about 2 percent to 4 percent in sales at stores open at least a year. ""Its sales were depressed by its automotive business, which was hurt by the warm weather and hard lines, which continued their weak performance,"" Merrill Lynch's analysts said in the report. Many retailers will have tough comparisons with their 1996 sales from February through the middle of spring, analysts said. But one retailer that is expected to exceed the average is J.C. Penney Co., which some analysts see posting same-store sales gains of about 9 percent. ""The (sales) numbers, I think are going to be led by Penneys in particular, which seems to have a strong reading for February,"" Niemira said. ""Apparel is certainly helping them."" The nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., is seen posting gains of 4-6 percent, analysts said. Electronics superstores should continue to trail the rest of the retail sector, analysts said. Dean Ramos, with Dain Bosworth Inc., estimated that both Best Buy Co. Inc. and Circuit City Stores Inc. would report a 7 percent to 10 percent decline in same-sales for February. ""New consumer electronics products such as Digital Video Disk are not yet a factor,"" Ramos said in a report previewing last month's retail sales. ","BradDorfman"
"Stowaway deaths in the holds of cargo ships leaving West Africa are prompting calls for concerted international action to combat the problem. Dockers at one port in Britain found the bodies of seven young Africans amid the cargo in ships carrying variously cocoa, coconut and oilseeds. Three Africans died in the hold of another cocoa ship in Ivory Coast's main port Abidjan in February after inhaling toxic pecticides, leading to rejection of the 10,000 tonne consignment by American buyers. Veterans in the cocoa trade recall the curious case of an African head that turned up in a sack of cocoa from Nigeria. ""The West African problem is fairly intense at the moment,"" says Chris Horrocks, Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Shipping. ""Industry has to gear up Western governments to bring the matter up but as their interests are not directly at stake it is often a token gesture,"" he said by telephone from London. British Prime Minister John Major agrees something needs to be done. ""We do need to examine both with the host countries and with the shipping lines better arrangements to ensure that they (stowaways) are not hidden away on their ships,"" he told parliament in response to a question. GOVERNMENTS RELUCTANT TO ACT But shipping officials say governments fail to act out of fear of facing the bills for handling stowaways, a cost normally borne by shipping lines and their insurers. Horrocks said the U.N. International Maritime Organisation in London had set up a committee to consider recommendations for a convention on stowaways but a rapid conclusion was unlikely. Many stowaways, fugitives from war or poverty, are looking for a better life in the West. Others simply want adventure. ""One boy was found at Marseille with his toothbrush and identity papers,"" said a shipping agent who investigates such cases. ""He asked us to send him back home so he didn't miss any more classes. He was a real Tom Sawyer type."" Most stowaways carry no proof of identity or nationality, prolonging procedures for repatriation or granting of asylum. Ivory Coast, a beacon of economic and political stability in West Africa, has become a magnet for stowaways from neighbouring states -- especially Nigeria, Ghana and war-ravaged Liberia. Port police say about 200 cases were reported in Ivory Coast in 1996. ""Stowaways slip on board from the lagoons at night or climb over port walls,"" said an Ivorian Transport Ministry spokesman. ""How to stop them is purely a police matter."" SOME DEATHS MAY NEVER GET REPORTED Investigators say many cases probably go unreported. ""If bodies are found at sea they are reported at the destination port but some are probably thrown overboard,"" one said. Shipping agents say port security is very low on the list of priorities in the African countries concerned. Posting extra port guards is costly and of little value when guards can be bribed to turn a blind eye. ""All African ports suffer from the same problem,"" said a ship surveyor who has worked in most of Africa's principal ports for over 25 years. ""We always have a number of cases in hand."" ""People talk about complicity of the crew but I find it hard to believe stowaways are paying for their passage. Most are completely destitute when they get on board."" As immigration laws around the world are tightened, particularly in rich countries targeted by stowaways, captains find it more and more difficult to land illegal passengers. They face the prospect of having to keep stowaways on board for years or heavy fines or jail for letting them ashore. SOME STRIKE IT LUCKY, MANY DON'T Some stowaways reach their promised land. Some manage to stay there. Many don't. The unlucky ones drown, starve, suffocate. Eleven Nigerians survived a three-day ordeal off South Africa's Dyer Island in January when they were cast adrift on an oil-drum raft in shark-infested waters. Seven Ghanaians who stowed away on a cocoa ship heading for France were not so lucky. Their plight -- and the story of an eighth stowaway who survived -- became the subject of a joint British-American film released in Ghana and worldwide last October. The case highlighted problems of international jurisdiction over murders at sea. Testimony of the survivor, Kingsley Ofusu, before a French court in 1996 led to murder convictions for the Ukrainian captain and crew of the MC Ruby. Ghana launched a campaign to publicise the deaths and discourage other would-be stowaways. It has also tightened security at the ports but the lure of the bright lights of Europe and the Americas remains a powerful incentive -- as the rising death toll illustrates. ","MatthewBunce"
"Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday raided the country's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, in a dramatic sign of a widening probe into payments to a client linked to racketeers. The late afternoon raid on Nomura headquarters in central Tokyo was by both prosecutors and officials of the nation's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC). The highly public raids, preceded by tipoffs to the media that they were imminent, appeared to signal that the action against Nomura could become a showcase as Japan seeks to clean up business practices and deregulate its economy. Coinciding with the headquarters raid, another 90 officials swooped on 10 other locations and for the first time formally spelled out the suspicions in detail. Deputy chief prosecutor Kunihiro Matsuo told reporters the raids were to investigate a Nomura director's illegal payment of 38 million yen ($309,000) to a company run by a relative of a racketeer to avoid disruption of a Nomura annual meeting. Matsuo said the other raids included searches of the homes of the racketeer or ""sokaiya"" and the Nomura director involved in the scandal, Shimpei Matsuki. The scandal surfaced on March 6 and Matsuki and fellow director Nobutaka Fujikura resigned on March 10 after internal probes found they made discretionary deals banned under Japanese law and funnelled profits to a front company for the racketeer. Sokaiya, often linked to ""yakuza"" crime syndicates, extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called ""sokai"" in Japanese. Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down on March 14 to atone for the scandal. He became an adviser to the company, and chairman Masashi Suzuki took over his position while retaining the chairmanship. Nomura, one of the world's most powerful financial institutions, is involved in bond and share trading. It exerts a powerful influence on every business in the yen bond market and is also Japan's top foreign bond seller. The company has seen key foreign and domestic clients suspend business with it since the scandal broke. Nomura has been a key player in Japanese financial markets for most of this century, underwriting firms such as Sony Corp, which were part of Japan's postwar economic miracle. In a scene akin to a Japanese film, 90 officials in business suits, led by a man with a briefcase, marched military-style through the front doors of Nomura's modernistic headquarters. They firmly locked the doors, shutting out journalists gathered for a raid designed to have maximum publicity value. Reports that the raids were imminent hit Nomura's share price, which ended the day down 20 yen (16 cents) at 1,440 ($11.70). But brokers said the impact of the news was limited as the market had expected such a development. ""What the market is more concerned about is any punitive measures which will be taken against the brokerage,"" said Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager. ""The punishment will probably have an effect on the firm's business and could have an impact on the whole brokerage industry as well,"" Ueki said. The investigation comes six years after Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients. Top executives at Nomura resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters. ","FumikoFujisaki"
"International Business Machines Corp. will unveil Tuesday its third generation of its low-cost mainframes, which are almost twice as fast as current models and much-anticipated by Wall Street and IBM customers. The computer giant, defending its still dominant position in the mainframe market, is also expected to unveil very aggressive pricing of the new systems and analysts expect mainframe prices to continue to decline even further. ""They are coming out with a very aggressive offering,"" said Carl Greiner, a vice president at the Meta Group. Three years ago, IBM unveiled this lower-cost CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology as the future and gradually its big corporate users have been moving to the new systems, which are less expensive to make. But the CMOS systems were not as powerful as IBM's older bipolar line. ""The big users need something bigger,"" Greiner said. ""We are now getting into the power where most people can use this machine. It will provide for 90 percent of users' needs."" Mainframes still generate the biggest bulk of IBM's product revenues, even though a few years ago they were declared the dinosaurs of computers by many analysts. But in the past two to three years, the mainframe has indeed enjoyed a big resurgence, with growing unit volumes, although prices are still in great decline. Helping fuel the continued interest in the mainframe as the keeper of corporate data are both the lower prices and more software being developed to enable broader access to the giant warehouses of data, including software gateways from the Internet. With IBM's help, mainframes are also being positioned as the biggest servers, or computers that manage a network, in a corporate ""intranet."" So users have kept buying mainframes with lower prices amid a price war among the main vendors. Hitachi Ltd. and its new Skyline mainframes have been gaining share at IBM's expense, because Skyline combines the older mainframe technology and the newer low-cost CMOS technology in one system, giving users more processing power. According to the Meta Group in Stamford, Conn., in 1996, IBM will have about 73 percent of the world mainframe market, down from 81 percent in 1995. Hitachi is expected to jump to 20 percent this year, up from 7 percent last year, while Amdahl's share falls to 7 percent from 12 percent. ""Skyline is more powerful than what IBM ships today,"" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst. ""About half the installed mainframe base hasn't bought CMOS because it wasn't powerful enough."" So customers have been widely anticipating this latest upgrade of IBM's System 390, as well as Wall Street, which is hoping for a strong fourth quarter, fueled in part by strong mainframe volumes. Even though the prices continue to fall, analysts said that the CMOS products are more profitable to IBM and its rivals, because they are less costly to make. ""It allows them to address more of the customer base with a more profitable product,"" Milunovich said. ""It's well anticipated by customers. As part of IBM's announcement, it will also unveil an upgrade of its mainframe operating system, called OS/390, Release 2.0, which will include higher security for software applications using the Internet's World Wide Web. IBM also plans to introduce Internet gateways to its DB2 database software, the dominant database software for IBM and compatible mainframes, analysts said. IBM also is expected to unveiled a mainframe version of its high capacity storage system, the Ramac storage device. IBM is hosting conference calls Tuesday for the announcements. ","TheresePoletti"
"United Biscuits (Holdings) Plc more than doubled its profits in 1996 to 109 million pounds ($174 million) before tax and exceptional items, reflecting a simpler and slimmed-down portfolio of products. United, which owns brands such as McVities biscuits and KP nuts but has exited from its U.S. Keebler subsidiary, said total exceptional charges, mainly from the loss on disposal of businesses, amounted to 84.7 million pounds in 1996 compared with 150.3 million in 1995. Sales rose by three percent to 1.887 billion and trading profits grew four percent to 129.2 million. Underlying profits growth was in line with stock brokers forecasts, but a presentation by management to analysts was greeted positively, sending the group's shares up 11 pence to 248-1/2p by 1415 gmt. ""It's all quite encouraging. The way they are analysing and managing the business is very much more in line with what the market demands,"" said Richard Workman, an analyst at ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett. The company said its recovery was strongly led by its British operations, while in mainland Europe, it started to realise the potential of businesses acquired earlier in the 1990's. UB's British business increased profits before exceptional items by 12 percent to 113.7 million pounds as renewed consumer confidence encouraged shoppers to step up brands. In an interview UB's managing director Eric Nicoli said UB Has now entered a phase of consolidation after a hectic disposal programme. ""The emphasis is on organic growth as we are now in a consolidation phase,"" said Nicoli. Over the last two years UB has sold its American snack operation Keebler, pulled out of Portugal and exited from Spanish snacks. It has also sold one of its Italian snack businesses, withdrawn from Turkey and Brazil and sold Ross Vegetables Products business in Britain. UB expects its margins in Europe to remain firm and to move up over the next two to three years, said Nicoli. ""We expect margins to move to 10 percent in all our businesses over a two or three year period,"" he said. (Corrects to make clear that company isn't expecting European markets alone to move by 10 percent.) UB margins are currently at around 10 percent in Britain and four percent in mainland Europe. In 1997 the company plans to build on the turnaround ""all our markets continue to be very competitive but we expect another year of good progress,"" said Nicoli. The total dividend payout was increased by 10 pence per share from 9.8p. The company's leading biscuit brands include McVities in Britain, Verkade in Holland and Oxford in Denmark. Biscuit sales growth came from the launch of Go Ahead! a range of low fat products. UB also owns snacks KP Nuts, Skips and Hula Hoops. ","TimFarrand"
"Computer makers are expected to report solid fourth-quarter earnings in what is normally the strongest quarter of the year, but the stronger dollar will hurt some big systems makers. Despite all the negative reports from computer retailers about lackluster personal computer sales, analysts said most U.S. PC makers -- with the exception of Apple Computer Inc. and AST Research Inc. -- will show strong sales growth, fuelled by hefty corporate buying. Apple is the first to report, with first-quarter results late Wednesday. Earlier this month, Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple forecast it would report an operating loss for its first quarter ended last month, citing weak U.S. demand for its Performa consumer PC and continued shortages of notebook computers. ""Most of the indications are that business throughout the (PC) sector, other than Apple, was strong,"" said Dean Witter analyst Eugene Glazer. ""With all the negative comments you are hearing from retailers, some of that market was going to the direct marketers"" like Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway 2000 Inc. Analysts said the world's largest PC maker, Compaq Computer Corp., was likely to report strong earnings, especially after semiconductor giant Intel Corp. reported a blowout fourth quarter, surpassing Wall Street predictions. Compaq gets about 20 percent or so of its revenues via store sales to consumers and the rest of its revenues from sales to corporate customers, which were booming. ""The consumer business didn't hurt them,"" said Jim Poyner, an Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst. ""Dell and Compaq are benefiting from the same forces, the transition to the Pentium Pro (chip), a hot notebook (computer) market and progress in the server (network computer) business."" On the larger systems side, companies like International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Unisys Corp. are expected to see some negative impact from a stronger dollar overseas and sluggish sales in Europe, while business in the United States remains strong. ""Business is quite good in the U.S.,"" said Jay Stevens, another Dean Witter analyst. ""Where it's slower, or where the concerns have been expressed, is overseas, mostly in Europe."" Digital is expected to report a slight profit as it slowly recovers from sales force problems in Europe and a money-losing PC business. PCs are expected to break even. ""I think it will be a good quarter,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich. Analysts said that they expected IBM's earnings to be a bit better than expected, but that its expenses for job cuts will be greater than previous quarters. ""Europe remains a slower grower, which has led to a number of organisational and planned efficiency changes,"" said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst. IBM reports its earnings next Tuesday.

"Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC), Britain's new cable telephone and television company, made its market debut on Monday valued at around 4.5 billion pounds ($7.3 billion), in line with analyst expectations. A free float of 14.7 percent of the new group, which was formed last year when the Mercury subsidiary of Cable and Wireless Plc merged with the three cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada, started at 300 pence per share and moved up to 306p in early trade. The dual flotation on both the London and New York stock exchanges was scheduled for 1330 GMT to coincide with the opening of the American market. Analysts had expected CWC -- which will provide local, national and international voice, data, multi-channel TV and Internet services -- to be valued at an average of 4.5 billion pounds. Despite bringing together cable TV groups NYNEX CableComms Group , Bell Cablemedia Plc and Videotron, CWC's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury. Although this makes it British Telecommunications Plc's biggest rival, some analysts believe that BT, valued at around 28 billion pounds, will have nothing to fear until at least the middle of next decade. Before it rolls out its network, CWC will have only 1.1 million residential and 80,000 business telecom customers compared to BT's 20.5 million residential and seven million business clients. But with 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure and initial debt of 1.3 billion pounds, CWC plans to complete its sophisticated broadband cable and local telephone networks and offer its services to six million customers by 2001. BT is currently banned from using its comprehensive network for direct broadcasting services. Nevertheless some analysts are cautious about the new company's prospects. ""On a longer-term view, any valuation becomes almost entirely dependent on your view of what the longer-term penetration rate is going to be for telephony and cable TV,"" noted one analyst, who declined to be named. He said BT would move into broadcasting by 2001 at the latest, when current regulatory restrictions are lifted, and the group was likely to move into interactive services such as home shopping and home banking sooner. ""Put that alongside the impact of BT's on-going marketing muscle in basic telephony combined with the impact of digital terrestrial TV and digital satellite TV and I think that will all serve to put a break on our expectations of long-term cable TV penetration,"" he said. But other analysts, such as Richard Jones at brokers Yamaichi and Andrew Harrington at Salomon Brothers, welcomed the transformation of Mercury from a typical telecoms group into a ""much more exciting and dynamic"" telephony and entertainment provider. Jones is recommending buying the stock up to 350 pence per share. Harrington values the shares at 438p and the company at 6.5 billion pounds. ""Everything BT can do Cable and Wireless Communications can to better and sooner,"" he said. Harrington argues that CWC's network cost structure has a competitive advantage against BT, its main rival on the telephony side, and satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc, its main rival on the multi-channel television side. ""It's got 50 percent fewer employees per line than BT,"" he said. ""We think CWC has a unique competitive advantage in the provision of multi-channel TV and telephony. I think it's going to exceed expectations in the next year."" CWC hopes to be first to roll out its 200-television channel service, possibly by autumn. The company will ditch the four brand names and instead use that of its majority shareholder -- Cable and Wireless. A huge marketing campaign is planned to ensure that the name wins public recognition. Now that the partial flotation is out of the way, analysts will be eyeing Global One, a partnership of Deutsche Telekom AG, France Telecom and America's Sprint Corp, which needs access to Britain and has been in talks with Cable and Wireless about the CWC venture. The two North American partners in CWC, which together hold a 32.7 percent stake, have not seen great returns for their investments in Britain's stagnant cable market so far and might be willing to sell all or some of their stakes, some analysts say. But with the privatisation of France Telecom delayed, no imminent deal is expected. ($ = 0.616 British Pounds) ","KirstinRidley"
"British drinks group Guinness Plc on Wednesday became the latest in a long line of companies to fall victim to the pound's inexorable rise on foreign exchange markets. The company said it would take a 60 million pound ($100 million) hit to its trading profits in 1997 as a result of the pound's continued strength against overseas currencies. Guinness shares fell 5p to 430p before edging back to 432-1/2 as analysts talked in disappointed terms about the size of its currency hit, outlined in a trading statement. ""The actual underlying trading is exactly as expected, in other words small improvements, but the currency hit is more than most people were anticipating,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst John Beaumont. According to an Edinburgh Financial survey of 25 brokers on Reuters historical database taken on January 10, the consensus forecast for Guinness' pretax profits in the year ended December 31, 1997 was 1.017 billion pounds ($1.7 billion). But most analysts now do not expect the company to breach the one billion mark. For 1996, the same brokers forecast on average pretax profits of 958.5 million. Shares in food and drink giant Grand Metropolitan slid 8p to 426-1/2p. At a rate of $1.60 to the pound, GrandMet says it stands to lose about 16 million in profit every year. The pound's advance began in August last year. From an index low of 84.0 measured against a basket of major currencies, its trade-weighted index shot up to 96.1 by the year-end, a rise of more than 14 percent. On Wednesday, sterling was trading at 2.66 marks and $1.67. The pound started the new year at $1.712, its highest level since it fell out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in late 1992. But Guinness' currency loss will be partly offset by a lower interest payments on its debt which analysts calculate should produce a saving of 10 to 15 million pounds. In its trading update Guinness said its interest coupon would be more than one percentage point lower in 1997. However, the company made positive remarks about its trading performance in 1996. Chairman Tony Greener said ""I am pleased that after substantially increased investment, our 1996 results will represent steady growth in profit performance for the year..."" Sales of spirits were one percent higher than in 1995 with notable growth in single malts and de luxe Scotch whiskies and prices will be up 1.5 percent overall in 1996. Total Scotch sales have recovered well in the second half, said the company. Most country markets have traded in line with the group's forecasts, with trading in Latin America improving in the second half as Venezuela and Mexico recovered annual profits. ""Business continues to be strong in Asia, with further progress in many markets, notably in Thailand, South East Asia and Korea,"" said the group. But it said ""unfavourable economic conditions continue to constrain sales in Europe."" In Britain shelf prices of leading brands were kept at ""target levels"" over the Christmas period. Guinness stout has increased volumes sold by five percent and draught Guinness by eight percent in 1996. But the company said the beer market in Spain has remained difficult, declining four percent, and drinkers switched from high margin on premise beer to lower margin take home. But Cruzcampo profits for 1996 are expected to be broadly in line with 1995 due to improved productivity. ($1=.5976 Pound) ","TimFarrand"
"WavePhore Inc on Monday unveiled a service that broadcasts data to home personal computers via television signals, allowing users to bypass bottlenecks in the Internet. The company said its WaveTop service will broadcast entertainment and information programming nationwide through TV signals, side-stepping the clogged phone lines and overstrained computer networks that slow Internet connections. ""We think we can complement the Internet beautifully,"" said Sandy Goldman, WavePhore's consumer unit vice president.   Initially, the WaveTop system will carry stereo broadcasts of a music radio station, real-time news, educational programs for children, and new and updated software to home PCs -- all without interrupting ongoing activities on the computer, the Phoenix-based company said. Once it begins U.S. operations in September, WaveTop will represent the first wireless data broadcast medium delivering audio, video, software and real-time data to home PCs, Goldman told Reuters in a recent interview.   ""This gets past the bottleneck of the phone line being busy,"" said Gary Arlen, a veteran online industry analyst who heads Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md. The system will be free to consumers who own a broadcast-ready personal computer equipped with a TV tuner, a device that several top computer makers plan to integrate into their machines this year. TV tuners now add $99 to $150 to the cost of a PC, but prices are falling. WaveTop is to be advertiser-supported. It may also provide consumers with optional higher value, pay-per-use services.   Arlen said the system is well suited for transmitting information that does not require instant feedback. ""For a lot of Web surfing, all you need is a way of quickly accessing things that are floating through the wires anyway,"" he said. WavePhore's system operates by embedding data into a portion of existing TV signals. The company has a pact with the Public Broadcasting Service's 250 local stations to broadcast via an unused portion of their signals.   This high-speed, point-to-multi-point service will have the capacity to reach more than 99 percent of U.S. television households simultaneously and is capable of being extended to Canada over the Canadian Broadcasting Corp's TV network. ""It's a network infrastructure that's already in place,"" said Joel Krasner of brokerage firm Southcoast Capital, the one Wall Street analyst who formally WavePhore. ""You don't have to have people using cable modems or fiber optic cables,"" Krasner said. He was referring to other, more costly delivery methods capable of speeding Internet delivery using phone and cable TV technologies.   Goldman said the WaveTop network plans to offer one radio station in 1997 and three by 1998, playing a choice of rock, classical music and jazz. KidsTop, aimed at children, will deliver educational programming developed by the Public Broadcasting Service and others, Goldman said. For news, the company said it plans to negotiate deals with media companies such as Dow Jones &amp; Co and Reuters Holdings Plc, offering a slimmed-down version of what it already offers on its professional investor network, he said.   Both Dow and Reuters declined comment. WavePhore already carries Dow and Reuters news on its professional investor network. Goldman said WavePhore has few information content partnerships to announce at this stage but is in talks with content providers for each of the seven services WaveTop will offer. Goldman said the company expects to sign these deals ahead of the formal launch of the service in September. WavePhore said a recent study by the technology research firm Yankee Group estimated that by the year 2000, nearly 20 million U.S. households will have PCs capable of receiving data embedded in a TV signal. WavePhore's strategy has been embraced by computer industry leaders Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and Compaq Computer Corp. All three are developing enabling technology to support the integration of home computer and TV technologies. Krasner believes WavePhore may strike a deal with Pointcast Inc, a Web-based information broadcaster. The two companies already work together to provide information to corporate subscribers, he said.

"A French parliamentary commission said on Wednesday that it approved a planned merger between Anglo-French industrial power group GEC Alsthom and state-controlled nuclear engineering group Framatome. But it attached a number of conditions to its approval that go beyond the terms set by Industry Minister Franck Borotra. The Socialist members of the commission, however, said they opposed the privatisation of Framatome and they feared four to five thousand of the company's 19,000 jobs could be lost. GEC Alsthom is a joint venture between France's Alcatel Alsthom and Britain's General Electric Co Plc. The French government in August gave the go-ahead for a merger study between GEC Alsthom and Framatome, the world's biggest maker of nuclear power stations. Framatome competes against Swiss-Swedish ABB, Germany's Siemens, Mitsubishi of Japan, and U.S. firms General Electric and Westinghouse. Alcatel has a 44 percent stake in Framatome, with the rest in the hands of French state groups CEA, EDF and CDR. The commission said in a statement that after six weeks of study and talks, it had concluded that a merger had undeniable advantages and even found that it would be ""suicidal"" for Framatome to try and survive the next 10 to 15 years on its own because few nuclear stations are expected to be ordered. The commission put down nine conditions to the merger. It said the group had to be French, which means that Framatome has to absorb GEC Alsthom, which is a joint-venture under Dutch law, and not the reverse. It also wants French shareholders to have control for as long the group is unlisted and a blocking minority when it is listed. It said the nuclear activities of Framatome had to be put in a special subsidiary of the new group and public authorities should have a right of veto on strategic decisions. It said the cash reserves of this unit should be at least equal to a provision for nuclear risks, or the cost of decommissioning plants, estimated at 6.5 billion francs ($1.24 billion). The commission said cooperation with Siemens on the development of a new European nuclear reactor should continue and the parliamentarians suggested a share swap between the nuclear subsidiary and Siemens's KWU unit. The commission also called for a new cooperation deal between Framatome, CEA and electricity utility EDF as well as for an extension to 2011 of an agreement between Framatome and nuclear material group Cogema on fuel rods. Finally, the commission said parliament should have control over the nuclear activities. It said all nine conditions were ""non-negotiable"". Borotra's conditions include French identity, the Siemens link, a French majority stake and provisions for nuclear risks. GEC has let it be known that it wants a stake equal to that of Alcatel in the new group and that it does not want to end up a minority shareholder. Framatome had net attributable profit of 663 million francs in 1995 on sales of 17.9 billion. GEC Alsthom had operating income of 2.6 billion francs in 1995 on sales of 29.3 billion francs.

"TCF Financial Corp. and Standard Financial Inc. said Monday they signed a definitive agreement for TCF to acquire Standard Financial for $424 million in stock and cash. The deal was announced two days after Milwaukee-based bank holding company Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corp. said it would acquire cross-town thrift Security Capital Corp. for about $945 million in cash and stock, or about $92 a share. Both deals help the buyer increase market share in the consolidating Midwest banking arena. Marshall &amp; Ilsley said it will increase its market share to 19.2 percent in Wisconsin, with Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp., the number two bank in the state, at 12.1 percent of deposits. At the same time, the acquisition of $2.4 billion asset Standard Financial and its 14 full-service offices would strengthen TCF's franchise in Chicago, allowing it to do more cost affective advertising than it could before the deal, William Cooper, chairman of $7.1 billion asset TCF said. ""We believe this merger will produce long-term revenue enhancements and meaningful cost savings,"" Cooper said in a news release. TCF expects to save about $4 million annually once the two banks' operations are combined in Illinois and to generate more than $4 million in revenues from the deal by offering more products to Standard Financial customers, changing the mix of Standard Financial's loan portfolio to add higher yielding loans and through fees at its automatic teller machines. ""Standard certainly has the customer profile TCF looks for, but I thought the price that they paid was fairly rich based on Standard's earnings,"" Stephen Skiba, analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp, said. The combined company would have $10 billion in assets and 276 financial services offices and more than 900 automatic teller machines in five Midwest states. TCF, a savings bank holding company based in Minneapolis, will offer about $25 for each Standard share. Standard stockholders may choose to receive cash or TCF shares or a combination of the two. Between 40 percent and 60 percent of the purchase would be paid in TCF stock, and the rest in cash. The exchange ratio for shares would depend on the average price of TCF stock during the 30 trading days before the deal closes. Analysts also thought Marshall &amp; Ilsley paid a full price for Security Capital, a $3.66 billion asset thrift with 42 bank branches and 10 lending offices throughout Wisconsin. The $92 a share acquisition price includes about 12.3 million Marshall &amp; Ilsley common shares and $376 million in cash and is a premium over the $84.75 closing price for Security Capital Friday. ""It's pretty pricey,"" said Thomas Maier, analyst at EVEREN Securities. ""You can argue that given what it does for them in terms of share in the state of Wisconsin, it's worth it."" Wisconsin is seen as one target area for Midwest regional banks to make acqusitions to enhance market share. ""I think it's a defensive move on M&amp;I's part, that if they didn't grow within the Wisconsin market, it was more likely they would be a takeover target,"" Skiba said. Skiba also said the acquisition of Standard Financial by TCF could make other Chicago-area thrifts, including MAF Bancorp Inc. and St. Paul Bancorp Inc., even more likely acquisition targets. ""I think there's becoming a scarcity value on the large independent thrift franchises that are left,"" Skiba said. TCF shares fell $0.625 to $44 Monday, Standard Financial rose $2.375 to $23.50, Marshall &amp; Ilsley fell $0.56 to $36.75, and Security Capital rose $0.75 to $85.50. ","BradDorfman"
"President Vaclav Havel on Tuesday paid a personal tribute to the grand old man of Czech literature, Bohumil Hrabal, calling him one of the great contemporary writers of prose, and a friend for life. The author of ""Closely Observed Trains"" and over 50 folksy works, fell to his death from the fifth floor of a Prague hospital on Monday where he was being treated for arthritis. Doctors said he fell while apparently trying to trying to feed pigeons. He was 82. ""He wrote ruggedly beautiful texts,"" the former playwright Havel said in a statement released by the president's office. Havel recalled writing a student essay on Hrabal, and joining him at the favourite literary hangout, Cafe Slavia. ""A beautiful friendship connected us throughout life,"" Havel said. On Tuesday, the normal afternoon murmur filled the U Zlateho Tygra (at the Golden Tiger) bar, where Hrabal was a fixture, and where U.S. President Bill Clinton joined the venerable author for a beer during a 1994 state visit. Many of Hrabal's old friends quietly toasted him in the room where a black sash over a picture was the only indication that a Golden Tiger regular would never return. ""He used to sit here, but now he sits everywhere,"" said one regular under a collection of Hrabal memorabilia. Hrabal's subtle political works were suppressed under the Czechoslovak communist authorities but were widely circulated in samizdat photocopies in dissident circles. ""I consider Bohumil Hrabal as one of the greatest prose writers of contemporary time,"" Havel said. The Jiri Menzel film ""Larks on a Thread"" was a biting commentary based on Hrabal's personal stories of a worker's tedious 1950s life after the Communist takeover. A Hrabal revival began soon after the 1989 revolution when ""Larks"", banned by the Communists, was reintroduced, and many of the author's works were finally published legally. Menzel also made Hrabal's quirky ""Closely Observed Trains"", about life at a provincial railway station during World War Two, into an Oscar winner in 1966. Another film, based on Hrabal's ""I Served the King of England"", is set to be released later this year. Havel, the dissident turned president, said he was happy to have been able to award Hrabal the state honour for artists, the Medal for Merit, in 1996. ","JohnMastrini"
"Prudential Corp. Plc Tuesday beat out rivals to win control of mutually owned insurance group Scottish Amicable and reinforced its position as Britain's No. 1 fund manager. By beating bids from Abbey National Plc and Australian Mutual Provident, Prudential's takeover of ScotAm will raise its funds to more than 100 billion pounds ($160 billion). ""Pru has not gone crazy and paid a stupid price,"" said Michael Lindsay, analyst at Lehman Brothers. ""The acquisition looks to be earnings neutral in the first year and enhancing thereafter."" ScotAm said policy-holders would benefit from cash and additional policy benefits worth more than 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion). These include 600 million pounds ($957 million) from Prudential shareholders' and policy-holders' funds in compensation for loss of membership rights and a special bonus from ScotAm's life fund worth 470 million pounds ($750 million), which will go into policies. In addition, the entire remaining ScotAm life fund will be distributed, estimated to have a current value of 500 million pounds ($797 million). On this basis, ScotAm with profits policy holders should receive total benefits of around 1,400 pounds ($2,232), varying according to the size and age of the policy. Policy-holders will also benefit from financial support to the tune of 1.3 billion pounds ($2.07 billion) to boost ScotAm's life fund which will be closed. ScotAm's original plan was to end its mutual status  and float shares on the stock exchange in two or three years. But the plan was thrown into confusion after Abbey National made a bid for the firm last month. ""Our offer used the strength of our balance sheet and the Prudential life fund,"" Prudential chief executive Sir Peter Davis told Reuters. ""We've put together an imaginative structure with the key difference being the capital injection or support we've offered of up to 1.3 billion pounds ($2.07 billion) to the (ScotAm) life fund."" Davis said the boost to ScotAm's fund -- the company will be run as a completely separate entity under the Prudential umbrella -- will mean that it will be able to have a more flexible investment policy. This could include a greater proportion of investments in equities and higher returns. The merger, creating Scottish Amicable Life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in June. Roy Nicolson, managing director of ScotAm, told Reuters the new capital would allow greater investment in equities, providing the opportunity for better returns for policy-holders in the future. He said Prudential had pledged to maintain the number of jobs in the ScotAm head office for three years. He said it was far too early to know if there would be job losses outside the head office.

"The Czech central bank should not prop up the crown even if it fell to the low end of its fluctuation band, a leading Czech economist said on Thursday. Without central bank intervention the market could force the crown as low as 20 percent below parity with its mark/dollar basket, Jan Svejnar, director of the Economics Institute at the Czech Academy of Sciences, said in an interview. This would give natural support to troubled Czech exports, he added. Svejnar said he was not advising an official devaluation of the currency, but calling for the central bank to allow a market-driven depreciation in line with the existing macroeconomic situation. ""I'm not saying that the central bank should go and devalue (but)...should be ready to let the currency depreciate,"" said Svejnar, who is also a professor at the University of Michigan. The central bank and Czech government have repeatedly ruled out a devaluation to boost exports, and the Czech National Bank agreed in its meeting on Thursday not to change its current policies. The central bank fixes the crown daily against a mark/dollar basket but allows it to fluctuate on the market within a corridor of plus or minus 7.5 percent of its basket parity. The CNB widened the band in February 1996 from plus/minus 0.5 percent and since then has virtually matched the market rate each day. The crown was fixed at the equivalent of 1.39 percent on Thursday. With the country's current account deficit exceeding eight percent of gross domestic product, the crown fell last week to a nine-month low after hitting record levels of 5.51 percent above basket parity in early February. Investors have moved into crown paper to take advantage of real interest rate differentials with major currencies. ""What I am more worried about is... sooner or later (the trade balance) will become untenable,"" said Svejnar, adding that foreign capital would then flee the country. He said that with the central bank foreign exchange reserves covering just about five months of average imports, central bank intervention to prop up the crown would be futile. Czechs ""should take a lesson"" from the 1992 crash of the British pound when the Bank of England made a fruitless attempt to defend its currency against speculators, who ultimately forced the pound from the European exchange rate mechanism, he said. ""Essentially, (the Bank of England) lost a significant part of its reserves and had to devalue the pound or let the pound devalue anyway,"" Svejnar said. ","JohnMastrini"
"The resignation of the president of Nomura Securities Co Ltd on Friday should be only a first step by the country's top brokerage house in restoring its scandal-scarred image. Analysts believe the resignation should just be to clear the decks so Nomura can carry out widespread management restructuring, including bringing in a young, untainted leader to help win back public trust. In a hastily called news conference, Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki, 62, said that he had stepped down and would become simply an adviser to the firm. Chairman Masashi Suzuki, also 62, took over the post of president in addition to the chairmanship. Sakamaki's resignation followed the departure of two Nomura directors who quit the brokerage last week after they were found to have made apparently illegal stock deals and funnelled funds to a corporate client linked by Japanese media to a former ""sokaiya"" racketeer. Several analysts said the resignation stopped far short of the action needed to restore public trust. David Threadgold, an analyst at BZW Securities Ltd, said although Sakamaki had resigned the failure to immediately announce his permanent replacement indicated the firm had not been able to find the right person to replace him. Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc, said Nomura may take several years to recover from a scandal which was a repeat of similar incidents in the early 1990s. Ikuyo said the fact there was a repeat scandal indicated there was a problem with Nomura's corporate mentality. ""Nomura has the potential to be a Japanese company which could be a winner in international competition and under Japan's ""Big Bang"" reforms as an investment bank,"" he said. ""To change the corporate culture, a drastic restructuring in management, such as the resignation of all senior executives, must be considered and a young and clean leader appointed,"" he said. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has vowed to carry out ""Big Bang"" financial reforms to implement substantial deregulation by 2001. A securities analyst, who declined to be named, was sceptical that a wholesale clean-up could be carried out. ""All the top executives have great contacts with corporate Japan,"" the analyst said. ""In Japanese business, it's also going to be hard to find a 'Mr. Clean.'"" A senior Finance Ministry (MOF) official told Reuters this week the ministry is waiting the outcome of investigations by the country's securities watchdog over the suspect deals. But the official said MOF was focusing on whether Nomura violated the Commercial Code, rather than securities laws. ""Sokaiya"" extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting, or offer to prevent a disruption of the proceedings by unruly shareholders. Japanese commercial law has prohibited paying off racketeers since 1982. Ironically, Sakamaki's presidency began in 1991 when top executives Setsuya Tabuchi and Yoshihisa Tabuchi (no relation) resigned after revelations the brokerage compensated elite clients for losses and affiliates dealt with organised crime. The two Tabuchis, however, rejoined Nomura's board in 1995, triggering a controversy among Nomura employees because the two were regarded as a symbol of the firm's previous tainted corporate culture -- aggressively grabbing profits, even sacrificing small investors' interests. New president Suzuki said that the two Tabuchis offered to resign from the board again. He said he would accept their offers which are not related to the scandals. ""My first priority is to restore confidence. I would like to transform the company to one with a healthy situation and transfer the company to the next generation,"" Suzuki said. He said that he would take all possible steps to avoid a recurrence of wrongdoing but fell short of announcing details. ""Nomura is not a family-run company and Suzuki's position as both president and chairman is something irregular,"" an analyst at a major local brokerage said. ","FumikoFujisaki"
"Czech railway workers on Wednesday voted to extend a national railway strike, scheduled to end at midnight, for another 24 hours after the government supported a tough approach against the strikers. Jaromir Dusek, chairman of the Association of Unions of Czech Railway Workers (OSZ), was quoted by the CTK news agency as saying that OSZ's strike committee had agreed to continue the action for at least another day. Dusek was quoted by the private television channel Prima after the decision to extend the strike that the OSZ would keep extending the strike until it gets an acceptable compromise. The OSZ had originally scheduled the action as a 48-hour strike, but said it would consider extending it for 24 hours at a time if its demands were not met. The government on Wednesday backed Transport Minister Martin Riman's hard line against the OSZ, which has shut the country's entire rail network over potential job cuts. Government spokesman Ivo Strejcek told reporters after a cabinet meeting that ""the government expressed its support"" for Riman, who has refused union demands for a long-term railway plan that guarantees jobs while sacking the current management. The spokesman declined any further comment. CTK quoted Riman later on Wednesday as saying a Prague court had ruled that the strike was illegal, but the OSZ then said that a different court had ruled that the strike was lawful. The strike, the first major nationwide post-Communist industrial action, has had little major impact on daily life, but businesses fear the shutdown in freight service will start to bite into earnings if the strike lasts longer. Cities have added buses to relieve commmuter pressure, but international trains have been stranded at borders with Germany, Poland, Austria, and Slovakia. Two rounds of talks between Riman and union officials on Tuesday failed to break the impasse, and the minister acknowledged the strike may go on longer. Fresh talks on Wednesday have apparently not yet led to a solution. The OSZ wants the government to implement a long-term plan to revive the decrepit railway system, saying that waste and inefficiency should be cleaned up before jobs are threatened. The state railway company, Ceske Drahy, lost six billion crowns ($216.4 million) in 1996, and expects to lose seven billion crowns this year, but the government has been unable to put together a viable plan for reversing the losses. Leaders of the OSZ reported that 75 to 80 percent of the more than 100,000 railway workers had joined the strike, but management of the railway company said over 60 percent showed up for work and signed a petition against the strike. An attempt to use workers who ignored the strike resulted in the operation of a just five trains on Wednesday, but the system was mostly idle. An effort to reconstruct Ceske Drahy ended in 1994 when the conservative government backed off privatisation plans to halt a threatened strike just hours before it was to begin. This time, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has given ominous warnings that the unions ""may go too far"" with the strike. Most major Czech firms have said a short-term strike will have little effect on their operations, though the coal mining company Mostecka Uhelna Spolecnost a.s. said it was losing between 15-20 million crowns a day due to the action.

"British composite insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Group Plc on Tuesday gave the green light to a planned share buyback as the company reported a sharp increase in profits for the first quarter of 1997. But in the absence of any major positive surprises, shares gave only a muted reaction to the news, slipping back 7-1/2 pence to 482 pence pence by late morning. Pre-tax operating profits for the first three months of the year rose 24 percent to 195 million pounds ($320.6 million), helped by a fall in weather related costs in the United States. Royal Sun said it remained on target to achieve at least the 175 million pounds of cost savings identified at the time of last year's merger and with the results now out of the way the buyback of five percent of the shares approved at the annual meeting would go ahead. ""We're now in a position that brokers can start to move into the market to do the buyback. How long it will take is just a matter of timing and it's something we're discussing closely with our brokers,"" chief executive Richard Gamble told Reuters. While a 34 million pound fall in weather-related costs boosted U.S. general business profits to 51 million pounds, a near two thirds rise in UK subsidence took the shine off the British results. The 10 million pound rise in subsidence more than accounted for the five million pound drop in British profits to 50 million pounds. ""Subsidence is a worry. The good news is the recent rain but it has been one of driest winters on record following on from other dry periods,"" said Gamble. ""We do anticipate subsidence is going to be with us for some time to come but that is being built into the cost of household insurance."" Analysts said views on the stock largely depended on assessments of the pace of progress in integrating operations. Repeating a ""hold"" recommendation on the stock, Tim Young at brokerage SocGen warned it may drag out longer than some expect. ""It is a huge task integrating the two groups and that makes us cautious for the short term,"" Young said. ""I find it difficult to see how it can operate as a truly integrated unit before 1999."" At Lehman Brothers, analyst Rob Procter said good news on the integration progress should emerge through the next 12 months. ""They are likely to beat their cost savings targets and the share buyback could be the first of many,"" Procter said. Following last year's six billion pound merger of Royal Insurance with Sun Alliance Insurance, Gamble said the reduction in staff numbers would accelerate in 1997. By the end of March some 1,500 people had left the company and together with properties vacated, annualised savings are so far running at 44 million pounds. The merger had not affected the group's ability to pick up new business nor retention levels which, said Gamble, were holding up to expected levels. Echoing remarks made by competitors last week, the company said the rating environment had become more realistic with a succesful four percent increase in motor market rates implemented last autumn. Royal Sun is to continue to keep an eye on opportunities for small acquisitions such as the recent 46 million pound purchase of Prudential's Italian life assurance and pensions business, but is not actively pursuing larger acquisitions.

"Solid growth in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's (CBA) home loan portfolio has brightened its profit outlook slightly and should underpin its half year result due for release on Wednesday, analysts said. The bank is expected to report a profit rise of about one percent for the six months to December 31. CBA itself has been warning since early 1996 that margin pressure would ensure flat profits for the year to June 30. But some analysts said CBA has been privately more bullish in recent months. ""It's been outlined by the bank that trading conditions have been reasonable and may be slightly better than expected, given the price war last year,"" said one Sydney banking analyst. ""Given some of the statements coming out of the banks, if the result's not going to be flat then it's going to be higher rather than lower,"" said ABN AMRO banking analyst Michael Pulman. Analysts are forecasting a net profit before abnormals for the six months of between A$535 million and A$560 million compared with A$541.9 million in the first half o 1995/96, but below the second half's A$577 million. ""I think you'll see a lot of volume in housing coming through which will be enough to maintain their net interest revenue,"" said the Sydney analyst. Reserve Bank of Australia figures show CBA's home loan portfolio grew 10.3 percent to A$28.8 billion in the year to November, while home lending growth by all banks rose just 7.5 percent. The CBA's share of home lending by banks, which does not include lending by the burgeoning non-bank mortgage originators, rose to 22.3 percent from 21.7 percent during the year. ""They do have a strong focus on the need to keep their share of housing and they've kept their share rolling along better than some of the other banks,"" said Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney. Analysts also said CBA's bad debts and provisioning were unlikely to drag profits any lower than in previous years. ""Provisioning will be fairly benign. We think that provisioning is at a trough and will stay in it for a few more results, particularly for CBA which is loaded up with housing more than some other banks,"" said Macquarie's Maloney. Market attention is likely to focus on just how much CBA's pre-emptive cut in its key variable mortgage rate last year, which effectively forced a 75 basis point cut in big-bank home loan margins, has cut its overall margin. CBA's group interest margin fell to 4.1 percent from 4.3 percent in the 1995/96 year, but this was before the home loan rate cuts of late 1996. CBA's containment of costs and what has happened to its cost to income ratio will also be of interest. Analysts said CBA appeared to have kept costs down well, although it was unlikely to have made big inroads into staff and branch numbers.

"M.A.I.D Plc, Britain's electronic business news and data service, said on Thursday it was poised to announce fresh deals to expand its reach while also promising profitability in 1997. Dan Wagner, founder and chief executive, said in an interview that having tied up International Business Machines Corp, Thorn Business Communications, Nokia Ab, Oy and CompuServe Corp, M.A.I.D was in final discussions with more partners. ""You can expect more substantial, global alliances to be tied up within the next few months that we've been working on for quite some time,"" he said. Wagner said new partners were likely to be telecoms groups, major publishing groups and online companies that would allow M.A.I.D, whose corporate customer base trebled to 3,800, to reach more business people. The company sent its shares jumping in relief after fourth quarter and annual figures pointed to a turnaround of the group's fortunes. Annual pretax losses came in at 7.03 million pounds ($11.2 million) compared to 4.05 million in the previous year, but fourth quarter losses narrowed sharply. ""All the sceptics out there are already cooking their hats,"" crowed Wagner. By 1100 GMT, the shares had jumped 16p to 188-1/2. ""We have now stabilised our costs against the background of continued increasing revenues in both the core business and through alliance relationships,"" Chairman Michael Mander said in the results statement. ""We are well positioned for profitable growth in 1997 and beyond."" Pointing to ""phenomenal"" customer growth, even in the highly-competitive U.S. online market, Wagner said MAID was placing markers in all areas needed to build a long-term position in the future of electronic publishing. M.A.I.D has already partnered with the South China Morning Post, the top English language newspaper with about 93 percent of news-stand sales in Hong Kong and with iafrica.com, the leading South African internet service provider, to expand the business in Africa and Asia. About 70 percent of services offered by M.A.I.D are based on research data. But the group also provides real-time news with its LiveWire services, which allows users to be alerted to pre-selected, requested headlines as they appear. Personalised access to 27 live newswires, ranging from the British regulatory stock exchange wire to U.S. news agency Associated Press, costs 150 pounds per month for 20 desks, Wagner said. This sharply undercuts similar services from news and information services Reuters Holdings Plc and Bloomberg, he said, although the product is aimed at individual business people rather than trading rooms. The deal with Nokia allows clients to access share price and foreign exchange information on hand-held devises and the Thorn deal allows high-speed access to the Internet computer network from hotel rooms. M.A.I.D says that because its electronic services are mainly research, rather than news, it is not threatened by companies providing news directly on the Internet. ""Ours is a supermarket of intelligence,"" Wagner said. ""News is one element our of brokerage research, country and economic research, market research, company research. ""The threat of the Internet is non-existent, the opportunity is enormous."" ($ = 0.626 British Pounds) ","KirstinRidley"
"Protesters armed with rocks, sticks and bottles clashed with police at a demonstration in Bogota's main plaza on Tuesday on the first day of a massive nationwide strike by state workers. Tensions heightened after leftist rebels announced their support for the indefinite work stoppage, vowing to back workers' demands with force and calling for violent action. The Bogota-based 13th Army Brigade said at least 42 people were arrested in and around Bogota on ""terrorist charges"" and more than 50 guns were seized as part of the army's round-up of ""agitators."" Union bosses said the strike, billed as the biggest in 20 years, had won the ""total"" support of an estimated 800,000 public sector employees and severely disrupted airports, telecommunications, oil production, government administration, and all but emergency health services. Coffee industry transport also broke down. Running battles erupted in one corner of Bogota's historic Plaza Bolivar as 200 young protesters, with faces covered by scarves and bandanas, tore up chunks of pavement to hurl at police crouching behind plastic riot shields. There were no immediate reports of injuries and the rioters dispersed after repeated baton charges by police. The rally of about 30,000 striking workers outside Congress broke up shortly after the violence flared. State workers called the strike to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike and an end to what they said was repressive labour legislation. The government, struggling to slash its fiscal deficit, has vowed to hold workers' to a weighted 13.5 percent increase. The strike began at midnight on Monday (0500 GMT on Tuesday). ""The strike is total. Workers have observed the call en masse and some social sectors are also joining in,"" said Hernando Hernandez, head of the oil workers' union USO, known for its combative, fiercely nationalistic stance. A communique issued by Cuban-inspired National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels heightened authorities' fears of imminent rebel attacks. ""We support our union comrades. But simply making demands (through a strike) is not sufficient,"" it said. ""These actions must go hand-in-hand with effective pressure tactics and expressions of violence and grassroots disobedience as the only method to resolve the real problems of the nation,"" the communique added. It said its backing for the strike was a preamble to what it termed a ""national armed strike."" In the past, the ELN has used so-called armed strikes to shut down vast regions of the country, blockading major highways, setting fire to vehicles and threatening people who show up for work. Hernandez said state oil company Ecopetrol had been severely affected by the strike but a senior company official told Reuters it had no effect whatsoever since administrative employees were filling in as part of a contingency plan. In the coffee industry, John Naranjo, commercial manager of the powerful National Coffee Growers' Federation, said truckers had refused to transport coffee for fear of guerrilla blockades. He said cargoes at dockside amounted to about 10 truckloads in each of the main ports -- well below average. State-run schools and universities across the country were shut down by the government as a security measure. Local radio reports said a walk-out by airport technicians had created a heavy backlog of flights into Bogota's El Dorado international airport. Some carriers, including Continental and American Airlines, suspended operations. ","KarlPenhaul"
"Czech annual average consumer inflation eased slightly in 1996, not as much as original government forecasts but still pleasing analysts. The Czech Statistical Bureau said on Thursday that its key sliding average inflation figure, which uses 1993 as a base, closed the year at 8.8 percent, down from 9.1 percent for 1995. Despite missing the government's original eight percent forecast, analysts said they were optimistic the central bank's tight monetary policies were hitting the mark, bringing inflation back under control after a strong first half surge. ""The final outcome on average inflation is a success because of its favourable development in the second half of the year,"" Martin Kupka, an economist at investment bank Patria Finance told Reuters. ""Of course in the longer run, we still need to see a more rapid decrease in inflation,"" he added. The CSU said month-on-month inflation for December was 0.5 percent, unchanged from November, putting consumer prices 8.6 percent higher, year-on-year, steady with the previous month. CSU chairman Edvard Outrata told Reuters that 1996 core inflation remained around five percent with government price dergeulations comprising the rest. But he said 1997 inflation would rest on whether or not the government decides to take further, stronger steps on freeing up energy and housing prices. The CSU said that price increases in foodstuffs, leisure and textile sectors accounted for some 80 percent of the monthly CPI rise. The CSU said industrial output slowed in November to an increase of only 1.4 percent, year-on-year, from a 5.3 percent rise in output in October while industrial wages were 17.1 percent higher for the first 11 months of the year. After the release of the figures, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said wage growth without productivity increases stemmed from a lack of industrial restructuring. ""We thought it (inflation) would be lower, and what I see, aboveall, is a fundamental wage problem,"" he said. ""The slower restructuring in some companies...is also a source of inflation, because it is generating of inflationary money, mainly through rising wages, without a respective effect (in output)"" Dlouhy added. The government battled wage growth throughout the economy with wage controls, ended in 1995, which tied rising wages to correspnding increases in industrial output. Pay rises in 1996, not matched by an increase in productivity, have accelerated an already large trade deficit, by sparking domestic demand which has in turn caused higher inflation and made exported goods less competitive. Boris Gomez of ING Barings Capital Markets warned attempts to further force down inflation in 1997 may be thwarted if wage growth cannot be brought under control. ""The December CPI figure was positive since even though there a strong Christmas shopping spree by Czechs...But we still are concerned about the effects of wage growth since it will be tough for the government to cap it,"" he said. Most analysts agreed that the central bank would continue its tight monetary policies at least for the first quarter of 1997, in order to keep a lid on inflationary pressures. The Czech crown too is expected to remain stable in the short-term despite lingering problems in forcing inflation down. Traders said the crown was unaffected by December's CPI figures since they were in line with forecasts. The crown was fixed by the cental bank on Thursday at 3.72 percent above its dollar/mark basket midpoint, slightly stronger than its +3.57 percent fixing the previous day. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","AlanCrosby"
"The bid battle for British regional electricity company (Rec) Northern Electric was on a knife edge on Friday as predator CE Electric won an extension to 2400 GMT for an announcement of the result. CE, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., had slapped a deadline of 1300 GMT on Friday for acceptances of its 650 pence-a-share bid which values Northern at 782 million pounds ($1.3 billion) and the result was expected by 1700 GMT. But the authorities later agreed to allow the extension under British bidding rules as counting and matching of share acceptance forms continued. CE Electric already held nearly 30 percent of Northern, bought on the open market, and had previously declared acceptances which brought its holding up to around 34 percent. Northern has claimed it has the backing of its largest institutional investor, the Prudential, which holds around 11 percent, as well as other funds including M&amp;G and Foreign &amp; Colonial. The bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year. That left it with depleted resources to fight this time, but it has promised a 17 percent hike in its dividend and vowed its gearing will be down to 95 percent by March 1997 compared with previous forecasts of 175 percent. Northern has consistently claimed that the bid undervalued it and called for a higher price. It said 700 pence per share was indicated in talks before CE Electric launched the offer on October 28, a claim which the Americans have denied, saying that the bid is fair value. Northern's share price closed in London up 2-1/2 pence at 640 pence in a generally firm market on Friday. Northern is the only Rec to have fought off a takeover after it spent 560 million pounds to fend off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year. If it falls to CE, it would be the tenth of the 12 cash-rich Recs set up at privatisation in 1990 to be taken over since they came up for grabs when the government's protective golden share expired in March 1995. It would also be the fourth to be taken over by an American company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London respectively currently underway. American companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining Recs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful English-speaking springboard for expansion into Europe. Among potential bidders, analysts named Houston Industries, which failed in its attempt to secure control of Norweb with Central &amp; South West Corp in October 1995. Florida Power &amp; Light and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which have both been rumoured previously to be interested in Recs, are again being eyed as possible buyers. The UK Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang has made it clear that he will consider bids on a case by case basis and only judge whether they should be referred to monopoly investigation on competition grounds. CE Electric's bid had been clouded by worries that Lang might block the move because of political concerns or to avoid reducing the number of benchmarks in the sector used by the industry regulator Offer. There had been worries that the ruling pro-privatisation Conservative party, which lags the opposition Labour party in the polls and must call a general election by May, might not want further takeovers in the unpopular sector. Electricity companies have increasingly attracted harsh criticism from lobby groups and the media over hefty executive pay packets, huge shareholder payouts and spiralling takeover prices. Lang's decision to clear CE Electric's bid on December 6 lifted a cloud from Northern's shares, which had been languishing around 600 pence. It also indicated that other bids might not face any regulatory hurdles. In less than a week, Entergy of the U.S. clinched an agreed 1.267 billion pound deal to take over London Electricity, which provides power to the capital and its financial heart, the City.

"The Prague Stock Exchange continued its strong performance in 1997, rising for the sixth consecutive session as investors turn their attention to shares of blue chip utility CEZ. CEZ, which fell out of investor favour over the past few months, is finding fresh legs as investors, especially from abroad, consider CEZ significantly undervalued compared with other blue chip issues. The Prague-based utility closed up 24 crowns at 1,070, to help boost the PX50 index 2.6 points, or 0.47 percent, to 560.4. ""CEZ has been very much lagging behind other blue chips...during the last three months but it's very liquid and it has a positive profit outlook for the next few years,"" said Radim Bajgar of ING Barings. ""For me at the moment, CEZ seems to be one of the stocks that has good potential...I think that CEZ might definitley go to 1,100...by the end of the week or maybe even today,"" he added. Engineering concern Skoda also performed well, rising 32 crowns to 1,020, following comments by Director Lubomir Soudek that Skoda's gross profit should rise in 1996 to about one billion crowns after a 166 million gross loss the previous year. He said the heavy machinery group, based in the western city of Plzen, which makes everything from trucks to tin cans and nuclear components, recorded a 40 billion crown turnover last year after 27 billion in 1995. Skoda's core companies, which exclude joint ventures of the group, reached turnover of 28 billion crowns and exports worth 10 billion crowns. Blue chips Komercni Banka and SPT Telecom did not fare as well, however, easing slightly on modest volumes.

"Trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific region were urged on Friday to cut customs red tape and make it easier to finance Asia's huge infrastructure needs, officials at the APEC trade ministers' meeting said. But an Australian proposal to develop a travelling ""smart card"" to let business officials from Asia-Pacific countries jump to the front of the line when clearing customs got short shrift from Canada, the conference's host. ""We are looking at a slightly different approach,"" a senior Canadian trade official said. ""Our approach is to try to work on a larger package."" Australia's proposal dealt with business travelers but not their cargo, the official said. The Philippines, Hong Kong and South Korea back Australia's plan for now, he added. The APEC travelling card was one of several recommendations put forward by international business representatives at the first full session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum for trade ministers. ""We are the reality test and ... we are very happy about the dialogue that we started today,"" said Victor Fung, co-chairman of the APEC business advisory council, an international group of trade-oriented business representatives that has considerable influence on the APEC agenda. Officials said Canada also used the session to drum up support to make it easier to finance Asia's massive infrastructure requirements. The region will require about $1.5 trillion to build transportation and communication links over the next 10 years, officials said. Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton urged his counterparts to make information about private sector investment more readily available and to develop a framework that dealt with foreign financing of infrastructure projects. ""It's a very preliminary interest right now, but (Eggleton) did flag the special interest Canada has,"" an official said. Officials said they expected substantial progress on harmonising customs regulations at the three-day meeting in Montreal. Canadian officials said they hoped to be able to post harmonised customs forms on the Internet that would let international traders file electronically around the world. ""They really want to move toward a much firmer, clearer blueprint, which will explain to businesses what it is they have to do,"" an official said. Canada, as host of the meeting and of the APEC summit scheduled for Vancouver in November, has focused mainly on helping small and medium-sized companies clear hurdles to expand international trade. Simpler customs procedures and travelling requirements would be a big boost for the smaller companies, officials said. The business community, especially smaller firms, would benefit greatly from financial guidelines for infrastructure, said Fung of the business advisory council. He said the council would recommend in Vancouver that APEC set up a network to tie together organisations dealing with small and medium-sized enterprises in each country. The APEC ministers are scheduled to take up broader trade issues on Saturday, during a meeting with World Trade Organisation officials and WTO Chairman Renato Ruggiero. In a conference document, senior officials requested that the ministers recognise the ""successful re-launch of the financial services negotiations and, while recognising that flexibility may be needed ... urge all APEC participants in these negotiations to strive toward achieving a permanent Most Favoured Nation-based agreement by December 1997."" The document also urged ministers to consider the WTO's planned review of an agreement for open markets in information technology, and consider broadening participation in the agreement to all members.

"The board of directors of WMX Technologies Inc. Wednesday rallied around its Chief Executive Phillip Rooney following a direct attack on his leadership by a major stockholder. An investment group led by financier George Soros called Tuesday for Rooney's ouster and proposed a slate of nominees for the board of the largest U.S. garbage-hauling company. In response, the WMX board said it ""unanimously reaffirmed its support for Phillip B. Rooney and his leadership of the company during his seven months as chief executive officer."" The exchange did little but aggravate the acrimonious struggle involving WMX, Soros and other large shareholders. ""I don't think they could really escalate the animosity any higher than it already is,"" said James Kelleher, industry analyst at the Argus Research firm in New York. The New York-based Soros group and other investors, including the Lens Fund in Washington, D.C., have been pressuring WMX to improve its performance for months. WMX, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said last week that it was cutting 3,000 jobs and shedding $1.5 billion in assets in a broad effort to refocus on its core waste management business. On Tuesday, the Soros group expressed dissatisfaction with the restructuring plan, proposed removing Rooney and named four individuals to its alternate slate of board nominees. Even with a 5.2-percent stake in WMX, the Soros group cannot dictate the company's future, especially in the face of widespread small shareholder skepticism about the large shareholders' motives. ""They can make a lot of noise and smoke, but when everything is done, their effectiveness is limited ... This thing is far from over,"" Kelleher said. WMX last week reported a fourth-quarter loss of $461 million after charges, vs. a profit in the year-ago period of $49.6 million. It  reported revenues for all of 1996 of $9.18 billion, compared with $9.05 billion in 1995. WMX said Wednesday that the board nominees do not qualify for consideration at the company's annual meeting this year. ""The documents we received from the Soros group attempting to nominate four individuals for election as directors of the company arrived after the filing deadline and contained incomplete information,"" WMX said in a statement. WMX added that its board was committed to search for the best possible candidates and its nominating committee had agreed to consider the Soros nominees later this year. ""Our board is absolutely committed to attracting the best directors possible. We want to make sure we are serving the interests of all of our stockholders,"" WMX said. If Soros does not prevail before or during the WMX annual meeting scheduled for early May, time may be on his side. ""WMX is far from out of the woods and is likely going to have a few more painful quarters, which will strengthen Soros' hand so that he might succeed next time,"" Kelleher said. The WMX board said that Rooney, a long-time manager of the company's waste management business, was the right leader for the company as it concentrates on that industry. WMX also said an important component of its restructuring plan was adding new, independent perspectives to its board and reiterated it had hired an executive recruiting firm to find appropriate candidates. WMX's stock, which fell 9 percent last week, was up 50 cents at $32.75 in heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange. ","KevinDrawbaugh"
"The Colombian government said on Tuesday that 16 soldiers and as many as 15 leftist guerrillas were killed in a fierce four-day battle in a mountainous area near the capital city. The fighting, in which the Defence Ministry said 13 to 15 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels were killed, began late on Friday when about 50 soldiers were airlifted into the area in pursuit of what was initially thought to be a small band of insurgents. The battle was the worst and longest to erupt near Bogota in recent memory as what turned out to be hundreds of FARC rebels made their presence felt with a bang on the doorstep of the nation's capital. Defence Minister Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez, who announced the army casualty figure with ""deep regret"" in a national radio interview, denied reports that dozens of soldiers were missing or unaccounted for in the rugged combat area around this mountain town just 30 miles (50 km) east of the capital. ""There are no missing soldiers,"" Gonzalez said. He said 21 soldiers were stranded in the early stages of the firefight. But he said all had been plucked to safety by their fellow troops and most were rescued unharmed. Army chief Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett told foreign journalists last week that Bogota was among the strategic targets of the FARC and National Liberation Army, Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group. Earlier on Tuesday Colombia's army said it was pouring hundreds of reinforcements into the mountainous area. Army sources in Villavicencio, capital of Meta province, told Reuters up to 1,000 troops were set to be ferried into the combat zone. Military sources also confirmed that intense aerial bombardments of the area had been under way since Sunday in a bid to crush the rebels. The latest bombardments came just after dawn on Tuesday and lasted nearly 90 minutes. Later in the day helicopter gunships buzzed an outlying settlement and strafed hillsides. One chopper later touched down in an area known as El Tablon and picked up at least three bodies of dead soldiers, witnesses said. No further gunfire was heard from mid-afternoon but an army officer said combat could restart at any moment. ""I'm sure the FARC hasn't got away. We have the exit routes out of the area blocked, they're just lying low,"" he said. At least 400 people have fled to San Juanito from outlying villages since late on Friday, pouring into the streets of the normally quiet farming town of about 1,200 people. ""I was about half a mile from the fighting, at night I saw the bullets flying past my door and windows,"" said Jose Angel Munoz, who said he fled his village on Sunday with his wife and seven children. ""I've never known such fear, the fighting has never been this bad,"" he said. ""It made me so sad to see the bombings this morning,"" added Litia Gutierrez, another displaced villager. ""I just don't know when I can go home again or what I will find when I get there."" The combat zone was cordoned off by troops late on Tuesday. But there was no indication that FARC forces were fleeing in the face of the government's firepower. Gonzalez said combat continued in the zone late on Tuesday and said ""it will continue as long as necessary."" ","KarlPenhaul"
"Britain's third-largest drugs company Zeneca Group Plc said on Tuesday that it broke a string of records in 1996, with sales topping five billion pounds ($8 billion) and profits surging above one billion pounds for the first time. Pre-tax profits before exceptional charges rose 15 percent to 1.01 billion pounds, beating the most optimistic analysts' forecasts. After exceptional charges, pre-tax profit soared 58 percent to 975 million pounds. Sales were up nine percent at 5.363 billion pounds, while the dividend was raised 13 percent to 35.0 pence per share. Zeneca's booming share price broke briefly through the 19 pound barrier, touching a new record high of 19.38 pounds during the morning. However the stock, which has risen by around 40 percent in the past 12 months, was trading down 16-1/2 pence at 18.86 pounds later as analysts pondered their meeting with the group's management. Chief executive David Barnes told Reuters the results showed the company was ""in touch with"" his ambitious target of doubling profits by the end of the century, but warned that spending on new products would restrain profits in the short term. Last year Barnes set what he called ""an inspirational target"" of increasing earnings per share (eps) by an average of 15 percent between 1996 and 2000. Before exceptional items, eps rose 14 percent last year to a record 70.6 pence, and after exceptionals jumped by 90 percent to 67.8 pence. The group's 13 percent rise in drug sales to 2.44 billion pounds dwarfed the six percent sales growth announced last week by its bigger rival Glaxo Wellcome Plc. Operating profits rose 10 percent. Heart drug Zestril continued to be the group's best-selling product, with sales rising 10 percent despite increased competition. Sales of established prostate cancer treatment Zoladex jumped 31 percent, while newly-launched prostate treatment Casodex ""exceeded expectations"" with sales of 68 million pounds. Sales at the agrochemical and seeds operations rose 10 percent to 1.68 billion pounds, while operating profits surged 56 percent to 224 million pounds thanks partly to sharply lower losses at seeds. Profits at the slimmed-down specialty chemicals arm also rose strongly, up 25 percent at 70 million pounds. Barnes said Zeneca had a raft of new drugs and agrochemicals which ""should be significant products by the time we come to 2001,"" when Zestril loses its patent protection. He said Zeneca had won its highest ever number of new drug approvals last year, and announced that a new migraine drug, Zomig, won its first approval wordlwide in Britain on Monday. Barnes said other promising products included the novel mild asthma tablet Accolate, which Zeneca said had sales of eight million pounds in its first few weeks of launch, schizophrenia treatment Seroquel and the fungicide Amistar. The company expects its capital spending to rise above the 400 million pound level this year as it gears up for new production, while research and development spending is seen rising around 10 percent after topping 600 million pounds in 1996. ""In 1996 we essentially, through increased capital expenditure and R&amp;D, invested one billion pounds in the medium and long-term of the business, while making record profits of a billion pounds, generating cash and having an ungeared balance sheet,"" he told Reuters. Barnes, whose contract as chief executive expires in 15 months time, would not rule out using the group's debt-free balance sheet to make a major acquisition. ""We are very alive to new product opportunities. We are alive to regional infill opportunities if they were to strengthen our business. If a good opportunity were to present itself by way of acquisition we would look at it, but here is no strategic imperative to do that. We have got strong organic growth,"" Barnes said.

"Australia's oldest newspaper group John Fairfax Holdings Ltd is expected to unveil sharply lower 1996/97 half year earnings on Friday, but analysts say the results may show the worst is over. Media analysts contacted by Reuters estimated Fairfax to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$37 million and A$42 million for the first half. Fairfax reported a 23.2 percent fall in net profit to A$62.43 million for the 1995/96 half.   However, they said the result should show improving advertising revenue in the second quarter, along with lower newsprint costs. ""They have certainly seen a pick up in ad volumes. It is still down on last year but nowhere near as much down as in the first quarter,"" said Nola Hodgson, analyst at HSBC James Capel. Hodgson tips a net profit of A$38 million to A$39 million, with the dividend remaining at 3.5 cents for the half. Vince Pepe at broker Burdett Buckeridge and Young estimated Fairfax to report a net profit of A$40 million for the half and A$75.1 million for the 1996/97 year.   Fairfax reported a net profit before abnormals of A$102 million in the 1995/96 year (July/June). Fairfax profits have been tumbling for the past 18 months on higher newsprint costs and falling advertising revenue, the latter a sign of a weak labour market. ""The pick-up in the ANZ job ads was some encouragement,"" Pepe said. On Monday, the closely-watched ANZ job advertisment series for January rose a seasonally adjusted 3.3 percent, the largest gain in a year.   ""Ad volumes are still down, but we are starting to see signs of life in real estate and employment,"" James Capel's Hodgson said. One Sydney-based analyst forecast Fairfax to report a net profit of A$37 million, while another, who also asked not to be named, estimated the newspaper publisher to report a net profit of A$42 million. Analysts were mixed about the second half as the first six months is traditionally Fairfax's stronger with advertising volumes associated with the Christmas period usually boosting the bottom line.   Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) owns about 15 percent of Fairfax and has never been shy of his intention to own Fairfax. ""This is not a company about earnings. The key issue is whether Packer is going to make a bid for it,"" the analyst said. Canadian media baron Conrad Black sold his 25 percent Fairfax stake last year, frustrated by the government's refusal to change foreign ownership laws for Australian media assets, which prevented Black from securing 50 percent control as he wished.   Analysts expect Fairfax to report an annual net profit of between A$75 million to A$84 million, an indication that some are forecasting a stronger second half. Fairfax's classified advertisments, which were dubbed by media baron Rupert Murdoch as ""rivers of gold"", are often viewed as a reflection of the Australian economy. Most economists tip the local economy to grow stronger in 1997. However, another media analyst, who also asked not to be named, said the market was not really concerned about Fairfax earnings and was instead preoccupied with a potential change in Australia's media ownership laws, which are under review.   Black sold a 19.9 percent stake to New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd. Brierley plans to buy the rest of Black's stake if its gets Fairfax shareholder approval at a meeting on February 24.

Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are widely expected to be named, but Constantinescu said Romania saw ""no alternative"" to its NATO integration, and should be part of the first group. Romania is trying to link its bid to join NATO to that of Hungary. The two countries have signed an agreement to form a joint military battalion and new Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea is to make his first official trip abroad to Budapest this week. Constantinescu said Romania, after a slow start in post-Communist reforms, now met NATO's membership criteria on democracy and human rights. ""There is no argument against Romania's integration into NATO. Anything regarding democratic steps, stability, minority relations, relations with neighbouring countries and regional stability, Romania has fulfilled,"" Constantinescu said. But the president said that ""radical"" economic reforms were still necessary, and his country could not rely on large NATO members to pay the bill for modernising Romania's army. ""It's clear that the United States... are not willing to support the costs of modernisation of military equipment for any large group of countries, because that would be impossible for the American taxpayer,"" he said. The U.S. government estimated last month that the total cost to bring in former Warsaw Pact members would be between $27 billion and $35 billion up to the year 2009. Of this, the United States is expected to bear costs of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, the Clinton administration said in a report to Congress. The frontrunners are all struggling to find the finances for modernising their military to the alliance's standards in the midst of massive economic reforms. Constantinescu, at the end of a two day visit to Prague, did not say how Romania might eventually meet the cost of military modernisation. But the Bucharest government launched a programme last year to seek credits for up to $400 million to pay for military modernisation. Romanian military planners have said the government expects to spend about three percent of gross domestic product in total military spending this year, or roughly $900 million. ","JohnMastrini"
"A year after the ValuJet Inc. crash, the top airline regulator suggested Thursday it would be impractical to force air carriers to install fire-safety equipment in passenger cargo holds in less than three years. Under fire for not moving more quickly to promote airline safety, the Federal Aviation Administration plans next month to propose the installation of smoke detectors and fire suppressors in all passenger cargo holds over three years. House lawmakers, however, accused the agency of dragging its feet on the installation issue, despite years of warnings from safety regulators on the need to do so. Lawmakers raised the possibility of a speedier timetable. ""It could be done in a very short period of time if we want to ground the fleet,"" Barry Valentine, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told a House panel. ""That's the decision. How much disruption do we citizens want to have in our air transportation,"" he said. But Representative John Fox, a Pennsylvania Republican, responded, ""I think we want to have as safe as flights as possible. And if they have to be a little slower, the public probably would like them to be a little slower."" Airline executives on Wednesday announced plans to place both smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in their aircraft, after initially balking at the dual requirement. FAA officials came under attack at the hearing -- from both lawmakers and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -- for not moving more aggressively to implement new safety rules in the wake of the ValuJet crash. ""This is pathetic. The FAA is pathetic. The industry is pathetic,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat. ""Any more needless deaths and we're going to crucify you."" The FAA announced six months ago plans to issue the fire-safety equipment rules, which will affect about 3,000 aircraft. But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal. ""Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we're in today? Or is there really going to be improvement this time?"" asked Representative John Duncan, a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee. Valentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the ""final assembly."" ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May, killing 110 people, because of a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners. The head of the NTSB disclosed this week, however, that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident. NTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident. Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24. ""It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week. You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place, that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States,"" Hall said. An FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB. ","RogerFillion"
"China's last imperial eunuch has died in Beijing at the age of 93 after a life that spanned the end of a dynasty and a communist revolution that made a mockery of his castration. Sun Yaoting, who served for seven years in the court of China's last emperor, died on Tuesday evening at his home in a Beijing temple, his biographer Jia Yinghua said on Thursday. ""He was the last eunuch in China,"" Jia said. Sun, who was born on December 29, 1902 near the northern port city of Tianjin, had his genitals sliced away eight years later by a father eager to wield power and influence through a son in the court of China's Qing emperors, Jia said. Months later revolution swept away the Qing dynasty that had ruled China for almost three centuries, signalling the end of a system of promotion by emasculation that had supplied Chinese emperors with servants and agents for thousands of years. Sun's remains were laid out in traditional style at Beijing's Guanghua temple on Wednesday, with a gold cloth across his face, rings on his fingers and in a white silk shroud embroidered with imperial dragon and phoenix motifs, Jia said. Sun had served China's Emperor Pu Yi during the final years of the last Qing ruler's residence in the Forbidden City after he was stripped of his imperial title in 1911. He was appointed to administer Beijing's temples by the victorious communist revolutionaries after they swept to power in 1949, said Jia, author of ""The Secrets of The Last Eunuch"". ""He was a man of rare intelligence,"" Jia said, adding that when Sun revisited the Forbidden City in 1993 after a 70-year absence he had been able to point out historical inaccuracies in displays arranged by curators at the former home of China's emperors. The eunuch's post-revolution security was shattered in 1966 when late Chairman Mao Zedong triggered 10 years of social ferment by launching the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. Sun became an early victim of the radicalism embodied by the Red Guards, Mao's youthful socialist stormtroopers, who roamed China attacking anything seen as tainted by the feudal past. Sun was sent back to his home village and in the chaos lost his precious genitals, which had been carefully preserved using traditional methods after his emasculation. ""They were thrown away by his family,"" Jia said. ""They were afraid of being implicated if the genitals were found by the Red Guards."" According to Buddhist beliefs, a eunuch had to be buried with his penis to ensure successful reincarnation as a man. ""He used to joke about it,"" Jia said. ""He said: ""When I die I will come back as a cat or a dog'."" Sun's adopted son and grandson would take his remains to his home village for further ceremonies on Friday before having them cremated in Beijing, Jia said. The end of the imperial system was a source of lasting regret to Sun, who believed that -- like many a talented eunuch of old -- he would have come to wield huge power if Emperor Pu Yi had remained on the dragon throne, Jia said. ""That was the regret of his whole life,"" he said. ","MureDickie"
"Mary Graessle had wanted a house of her own, so three months ago she took a deep breath and bought a mobile home in Chateau Properties Inc.'s Lake in the Hills community here. Today, her double-wide, vinyl-sided dwelling, built in a Redman Industries Inc. factory, is at the centre of some of the biggest merger activity ever to hit the manufactured housing industry. Two competing mobile home community operators -- Sun Communties Inc. and Chicago investor Sam Zell's Manufactured Home Communities Inc., are bidding for Chateau, while Champion Enterprises Inc. recently agreed to acquire Redman in a $315 million stock swap. The deals are expected to make Auburn Hills-based Champion the nation's largest home manufacturer and whoever buys Chateau will become the largest real estate investment trust in the industry. Some analysts expect Chateau, based in Clinton Township, Mich., to respond to the offers in the next few weeks. Graessle's purchase decision was based on pure economics. The recently divorced, 48-year-old bookkeeper for a medical equipment firm simply found that she could get more house for her money in a manufactured home. She paid under $60,000 for a three-bedroom, 1,680 square-foot house, versus more than $100,000 for a similarly sized site-built home. ""I had a hard time with it at first. I did not want to move into a trailer park,"" she said. ""But I felt better once I saw this place. It's not junked-up."" Lake in the Hills, a well-maintained community near Chrysler Corp.'s gleaming new headquarters in one of metro Detroit's hottest real estate markets, is one of a growing number of communities that are helping to revamp the image of mobile homes. The dwellings that occupy them are no longer the tin boxes they were in the 1960s. They offer cathedral ceilings, drywall interiors, exterior dormers and other features that make them look more like conventional site-built homes. ""This is no longer the trailer of 30 years ago of 'I Love Lucy' fame,"" noted Champion Chief Executive Walter Young. For the first six months of 1996, manufactured homes made up about 24 percent of U.S. housing starts and 32 percent of all sales of new homes. Industry executives believe they can account for 30 percent of new housing starts in the next several years, although growth in home shipments has slowed to 9.5 percent this year from 20 percent two years ago. Walter Wells, chief executive officer of Middlebury, Ind.-based Schult Homes Corp., said he believes the recent merger activity is the result of the industry's profit potential and shows it is losing its trailer-park stigma. ""Fundamentally, the industry continues to gain share of single-family housing starts,"" Wells said. ""It's doing that because the product offered to consumers these days matches what a house should be -- it looks like a house, it has all the amenities of a site-built house and it offers a better value per square foot."" According to the Manufactured Housing Institute, the average price per square foot for a multi-section mobile home was $26.79, versus $56.28 for a site-built home, excluding land costs. The average multi-section home sold for $45,900, compared with $119,025 for a site-built home, excluding land costs. The industry's growth also is a boon to suppliers. Grand Rapids, Mich.-based Universal Forest Products Inc., which makes 60 percent of the roof trusses used in manufactured homes, last month reported a 55 percent gain in second-quarter earnings to $8.2 million. The industry's growth in urban areas, however, could be limited by difficulties in obtaining and development approvals for new manufactured home communities. Conventional homeowners still worry that nearby manufactured homes will drag down their property values. ""Zoning remains difficult to achieve,"" said Jeffrey Jorissen, chief financial officer for Farmington Hills, Mich.-based Sun Communities. ""It's the not-in-my backyard syndrome."" But that has also created an opportunity for mobile home community operators because the limited supply of parks maintains strong demand for prime suburban home sites. That allows firms like Sun and Chateau to increase land rents annually for homeowners like Graessle. She pays about $370 a month for her large lot, which offers backyard views of a pond and a stand of trees. A prime location also means that her home is more likely to appreciate in value. Although such dwellings have steel frames that allow them to be transported, few are ever moved because of the prohibitive cost -- $4,000 to $10,000. Graessle, herself a sceptic at first, said her total costs, between $700 and $800 a month for mortgage and land rent, are tough to beat. ""For what you pay for an apartment, you're getting three times the size and you own it,"" she said. ","DavidLawder"
"China on Thursday ordered two 747 airliners from U.S. aviation giant Boeing Co in a multimillion dollar deal that Washington's ambassador to China said was hastened by upcoming visits by U.S. congressmen. The two jets would be powered by engines from Pratt and Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp, and would be delivered in 1999 to Air China, Beijing's international carrier, officials of the China Aviation Supplies Corp said. Closure of the $383 million contract, which follows the purchase of three 747-400s by Air China in July last year, had been hastened by imminent visits to Beijing of about 35 U.S. congressmen, said U.S. ambassador James Sasser. ""This Boeing contract is something that has been under discussion for some time,"" Sasser told reporters. ""Clearly there was an effort to try to finalise this transaction on the eve of the visit of a number of senators and congressmen."" One official bipartisan delegation of around 22 U.S. congressmen is scheduled to arrive in Beijing next week for talks with Chinese officials that are expected to include touchy issues such as the Sino-U.S. trade balance and human rights. Relations between Washington and Beijing have long been battered by disputes over trade, Taiwan, copyright piracy and China's human rights record, but both sides say ties warmed in the latter half of 1996. Chinese efforts to ease Beijing's swelling and highly sensitive trade surplus with the United States were likely to provide a boost to U.S. exports to China, Sasser said. ""I think you will see over the coming months an effort on the part of the Chinese to make additional purchases of U.S. goods, in an effort to try to even up as much as possible the present trade deficit with the United States,"" he said. The United States says it has a trade deficit with China, reaching nearly $29 billion in the first nine months of last year. Beijing insists that its customs figures show a surplus in favour of the United States. The ambassador declined to give details of the deals likely to be agreed or to say which sectors might benefit most. Some U.S. businessmen say high-profile sales are among the earliest casualties of Sino-U.S. diplomatic spats, and Boeing has in the past hinted that it has lost deals to European archrival Airbus Industrie for political reasons. Boeing officials at the Thursday signing declined to comment on whether the 747 contract had been hastened by the recent thawing in cross-Pacific ties, but Regional Director for Aircraft Contracts Arthur Abel said the deal was heartening. ""We are just very encouraged and optimistic about our long term relationship with China,"" Abel told Reuters. A Boeing statement said the two 286-passenger 747 Combis it would supply to Air China marked a strong vote of confidence in the U.S. planemaker from an airline that already operated 45 of its aircraft. Officials of the state-run China Air Supplies Corp also welcomed the deal, although they identified the ordered aircraft as 301-seat 747-400s. ","MureDickie"
"Russian economic crime officials said on Thursday they were investigating the head of Russia's second largest aluminium smelter. Company and ministry officials said Yuri Kolpakov, general director of Krasnoyarsk, the second biggest aluminium smelter in the world, was under investigation over the alleged failure to repatriate $20 million from contracts for raw materials supplies. Olga Semenyaka, a member of an Interior Ministry investigative committee dedicated to the crackdown on crime in industry, told Reuters by telephone from the south Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk that she had personally opened the investigation on Monday. ""I think I have told you enough,"" Semenyaka said. She declined to give further details. Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov is locked in a battle against what he has described as the ""crime-ridden"" world of Russia's aluminium industry, which last year was the world's biggest exporter of primary metal. Gennady Druzhinin, Krasnoyarsk's board chairman, confirmed by telephone from Krasnoyarsk that a probe had been launched against Kolpakov, but also gave no details. Asked if output or exports would be affected, he said, ""No."" Krasnoyarsk produced 770,000 tonnes of aluminium last year, 27 percent of Russia's 2.87 million tonne output. Andrei Grigoryev, head of the smelter's information section, said he did not know of the charges and said Kolpakov was out of town. Reuters could not contact him. Interior Ministry officials in Moscow could not be reached for immediate comment. Kulikov has never said what kind of crimes he believes take place in the domestic metal industry, but Russian aluminium officials have in the past been the target of death threats and contract killings. Industry sources said the investigation of Kolpakov concerned a tolling deal -- under which a trading company supplies a smelter with raw materials for processing and then exports the finished metal -- with an offshore concern identified by the sources as Leo Trust Company. Krasnoyarsk, also known as KrAZ, does much of its tolling business with Glencore AG of Switzerland, which has a stake in the smelter and a joint venture called Krazpa Metals NV. There is no suggestion Glencore is linked in any way to the investigation. ""If it weren't for Glencore, we wouldn't be working right now,"" said a Krasnoyarsk source. --Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520 ","LynnleyBrowning"
"Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier Plc reported an 11 percent rise in 1996 profit on Wednesday but warned that currencies could depress this year's earnings. Reed Elsevier co-chairman Nigel Stapleton told Reuters the strength of sterling would, if maintained, ""drag down"" headline earnings by five percent this year. Earnings figures for the combined businesses of Reed Elsevier are expressed in sterling. Pre-tax profits rose to 805 million pounds from 723 million on turnover from continuing operations up to 3.38 billion pounds from 3.21 billion. Analysts had forecast profits of between 808 and 821 million pounds. Reed International Plc , the British arm of the business, proposed a two-for-one share split to take effect in May. London-listed Reed shares were down 23.5 pence to 1,150.5p at 1145 GMT, while Elsevier NV shares in Amsterdam dipped 1.70 guilders to 30.80. Analysts said the company's performance had fallen slightly short of expectations and that Reed shares had risen more than 10 percent over the last two months on bid speculation. For shareholders in Reed the full-year dividend was raised by 11 percent to 27.2 pence per share. Elsevier shareholders will receive 0.76 guilders per share, a 29 percent increase. The company noted that currency conversions meant that Elsevier results and dividends were helped in guilder terms. ""It's good news for Elsevier and bad for Reed,"" said co-chairman Stapleton. ""(But) the two share prices are linked so much that Elsevier should pull Reed up with it in some respects,"" he added. Stapleton said the 1996 figures reflected a ""solid performance"" right across the group. They followed a four percent earnings dilution resulting from the company's 1995 consumer business divestment programme. Reed Elsevier sold consumer businesses, such as local newspapers, in order to focus on the provision of information in fields like science, business and the legal profession. Reed Elsevier said it remained committed to an active acquisitions policy. The company spent over 300 million pounds on some 20 transactions in 1996. Stapleton said a ""big deal"" such as Reed's $1.5 billion purchase of U.S. on-line information supplier LEXIS-NEXIS in 1994 would be ""nice but not necessary"". Reed said its proposed share split would be put to the vote at its annual general meeting in April, to take effect the following month. It gave no reason for the split, but companies often opt to split their stock in the belief that the process makes their shares more liquid or tradeable. ","KeithWeir"
"The Prague Stock Exchange slipped on Monday from last week's year high on a round of profit taking, but analysts said sentiment remains bullish for the coming weeks. After a strong rise last week, market heavyweights SPT Telecom, CEZ and Komercni Banka, which together account for almost half of the PX50 index, all fell sharply to drag the index down 0.28 percent to 598.0 points. ""The market has corrected a little bit, but there seems to be good support at this level,"" Marco Anderegg of Patria Finance told Reuters. ""Foreign investor interest remains solid and towards the end of last week broader issues were gaining interest so it looks solid for a lot of the market,"" he added. SPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, closed down 75 crowns at 3,700, while power company CEZ, which accounts for 14 percent, was off 28 crowns to 1,202 and commercial bank Komercni (11 percent) lost 25 crowns to 2,620. ""We saw some of the blue chips such as Komercni and SPT rebound in late deals, which could show that the market's weakness will be short-lived. I expect to see prices begin rising again soon,"" said one local trader. The PSE has been climbing steadily since a slump in the fourth quarter 1996 took 25 percent off the index. Analysts blamed a lack of government commitment to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency for the dive. The index has gained 9.7 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors. Bram Buring of Brno Broker Group said the correction could last for several weeks as lower than expected company results began to flood in, possibly taking as much as five percent from the index before it rebounds. But he added: ""Foreign investors are definitely interested and kick starting the market...We expect that to continue but things have overheated a little at the moment."" Analysts added that the recent strong performance of the crown should also boost the equities market since investors are shielded from wide currency fluctuations. The crown has gained over three percent against its dollar/mark basket since the beginning of the year, and analysts have predicted it will hold its value or strengthen further in the coming weeks. In late afternoon trading on Monday it was holding steady at 5.32 percent above its basket mid-point, up slightly from the central bank's daily fixing at 5.28 percent over the mid-point. The crown was fixed on Friday at 5.23 percent above the mid-point. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","AlanCrosby"
"Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was on Thursday drawn closer to the probe into alleged irregularities in three Morgan Grenfell investment funds. At the same time it emerged the investigation had cast its net overseas, as City regulatory sources confirmed newspaper reports that the inquiry extended beyond Britain. The SFO said it was involved but was not mounting its own investigation. A spokeswoman for the SFO said the office was in contact with Britain's investment watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) which would share any relevant material with the office. The SFO investigates and prosecutes major financial crimes in the City of London. The Times newspaper said in its Friday edition that a senior SFO lawyer had been briefed officially by IMRO. It added that overseas authorities, in the U.S., Luxembourg and Switzerland, had also been involved in the process. ""We have been in contact with IMRO. IMRO are investigating and will share anything of relevance with us,"" the SFO spokeswoman told Reuters on Thursday. And after the funds, which were suspended on Monday, resumed trading, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the UK-based investment banking arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank, said nearly eight percent of three Morgan Grenfell investment funds being investigated for alleged irregularities had been redeemed. The funds, run by Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), were suspended due to suspected ""irregularities,"" but resumed trading after Deutsche Bank spent 180 million pounds ($282.4 million) removing certain unlisted securities from the funds. ""This is good news because people were predicting they would be selling lots...but there has been no panic selling,"" said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell spokesman James Murray. Industry sources, however, said that redemptions of eight percent in one day was a major reverse. IMRO's own probe into MGAM has already led to the suspension of two fund managers and briefly saw trading halted in three MGAM funds, which have around 90,000 small investors. Sources in both the British banking and fund management industries said the probe appeared to be focusing on links between suspended MGAM fund manager Peter Young and a UK-based broker, Fiba Nordic Securities. Young was not immediately available for comment. And a spokesman for Fiba Nordic Securities in London said the firm welcomed any investigation and denied any improper relationship with MGAM. Fiba has been a broker and valuer for funds managed by MGAM. British regulatory sources said the UK's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) had previously been examining the activities of Fiba over another matter. This had subsequently led to the unofficial investigation by IMRO into MGAM which prompted Young's suspension. Young, whose personal assets were frozen as a result of a high-court injunction last night, was suspended from MGAM on Monday. MGAM announced on Wednesday evening that a second manager, Stewart Armer, had also been suspended. DMG said Armer was suspended on Wednesday evening ""following the discovery of a suspected breach of personal account dealing rules."" A source close to the investigation said Armer's assets would not be frozen and he was not a central focus of the probe. Armer was not available for comment. In Frankfurt, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said neither Young nor Armer had committed an obvious breach of regulations. ""But both were hovering on the brink of a grey area,"" spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf told Reuters. According to sources close to the investigation, the probe is trying to determine whether the fund's investments in unquoted stocks were valued above their real worth. The fall-out spread to Sweden where Young had invested substantially in unlisted stocks. Stocks held in his portfolio fell amid concerns from Swedish officials about the impact of the probe on Sweden's alternative stock market. In Britain the saga is likely to lead to a reappraisal of how funds are managed. ""We will be reviewing our collective investment scheme rules, in particular, the valuation of unquoted securities and the position of prelisted stocks,"" a spokesman at Britain's Securities and Investments Board (SIB) told Reuters.

"Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive-designate, is a Confucian who loves to preach on the need for harmony and order as he shepherds this bustling capitalist territory from British to Chinese rule. On Thursday he showed off his new offices, which boast a soothing view over a waterfall tumbling from the lush green tropical slopes of Hong Kong Park. The seventh floor suite will be his base at least until the Union Jack is furled and China's red flag hoisted at midnight on June 30, marking the end of more than 150 years of colonial rule. He won't be able to practise his Chinese ""tai chi"" exercises on the rooftop as he once did at his offices at the Orient Overseas shipping company, where he quit as chairman last year in order to become Hong Kong's future leader. But the view should help when he meditates on the growing political rifts and the anxiety about lost freedoms that are prefacing the transfer of sovereignty. As he looks out of the window he will be facing east and conveniently turning his back on Government House, seat of the departing British Governor Chris Patten. Mobbed by journalists as he put his offices on display, Tung lambasted critics, particularly the popular Democratic Party, who have been lobbying the West against China's plans to roll back Hong Kong's democracy and human rights. ""There are people from Hong Kong including the Democratic Party who are overseas talking down Hong Kong as though the world will come to an end here,"" Tung said, referring to a current European tour by Democrat leader Martin Lee. The quarrel underlined the political tension that Tung has to contend with in his new office in the coming months as Hong Kong prepares to become a Special Administrative Region of China. The skyscraper rises in a prime commercial district in one of the world's most expensive cities, and his neighbours in the building include Hong Kong's Futures Exchange and a clutch of big name international brokerage houses. Staff from some of these companies told reporters on Thursday they did not welcome the likely disturbance whenever Hong Kong's news hounds pour into Tung's 11th floor press centre. ""That's not what we expect to put up with when we pay these high rents,"" one executive said. Tung, 59, has already signalled he does not intend to move into Government House, a luxurious mansion with a rich history, citing bad ""fung shui"", Chinese parlance for an inauspicious relationship with nature but a remark interpreted by many in Hong Kong as an oblique attack on British rule. Visitors to Tung's office will find a bright welcome in a reception area with ""People's Republic of China SAR Chief Executive's Office"" in gold lettering on the wall, topped in red with Hong Kong's new emblem, the tropical bauhinia flower. His advisory cabinet, the Executive Council, which he has filled with politicians and businessmen approved by Beijing, will meet in an adjacent conference room around a long oval table, resembling the board room of a blue chip company.

"With the ruling Liberals far ahead in the polls, the biggest question in the campaign for Canada's June 2 federal election is not who will win but which opposition party will place second. ""It's an election that's quite unlike what you see in other Western countries because there really is no realistic option (aside from the Liberals),"" Reg Whitaker, a political scientist at York University in Toronto, said recently. ""The opposition parties are fighting for small markets. It's wide open for the Liberals."" Despite opposition criticism of the Liberals' record on national unity, unemployment and taxes, polls show the Liberal party with a consistently strong lead. The official opposition since the last election in 1993 has been the Bloc Quebecois, whose sole aim is promoting Quebec independence, not forming a federal government. ""They want to put themselves out of business,"" Whitaker said. ""So right off you have a bizarre situation."" Prime Minister Jean Chretien called the June 2 election on Sunday. In the last election in 1993, the Liberals won 177 out of 295 seats, the Bloc Quebecois 54 seats, the Reform Party 52, the New Democrats nine and the Conservatives two. One independent was elected. Unless one of two right-wing parties -- the Conservatives and Reform -- can consolidate nationwide support, analysts said, the Bloc was poised to be the official opposition again, keeping the Quebec sovereignty issue on the front burner. Reform, with strong roots in western Canada but feeble support elsewhere, has painted itself as the only party that can hold the Liberals accountable. But it stops short of seeking the role of government for now. ""Our ultimate objective is to get a Reform government,"" party leader Preston Manning said recently. But when asked about his immediate goal, he said he wanted to win enough seats to form the official opposition. ""They're mainly concerned about holding on to what they've got,"" Whitaker said. Reform had 50 seats when the House of Commons was dissolved on Sunday. The Conservatives, led by Quebecker Jean Charest, stubbornly maintain they can form the next government, but the right-leaning party has a long way to go. In 1993 the party, one of the oldest in Canada and the ruling party from 1984 to 1993, lost all but two of its seats in the House of Commons. ""They have some severe limitations,"" Whitaker said. ""You see the Conservative Party and the Reform Party fighting over the same right-wing margins."" Reform and the Conservatives are both campaigning on smaller government and tax cuts as ways to fix Canada's persistent unemployment problem. The Conservatives, however, stand to gain in Quebec, while Reform has no base in the French-speaking province. A poll in Quebec released on Monday showed support for the Liberals at 37 percent, the Bloc at 35 percent and the Conservatives at 25 percent. Alone on Canada's left wing is the New Democratic Party, which makes no claims to forming a government. ""Federally, we've never made a government, but we've always been there to make a difference,"" NDP leader Alexa McDonough said as she launched her campaign last weekend. But the Liberals have co-opted the NDP too, appealing to moderate left-wing Canadians with talk of preserving health care, social programmes and the national pension system, and promoting Liberal legislation on gun control.

Chicago-based Quaker said it earned $18.1 million, or 12 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $47.8 million, or 36 cents a share, in the 1995 period. Excluding a $40.8 million pretax restructuring charge in the 1995 fourth quarter, Quaker posted a year-ago operating loss 18 cents a share. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.06 billion, down 10 percent from $1.18 billion a year earlier, which included $90.3 million from divested businesses. For the full year, Quaker said it earned $244 million, or $1.80 a share, which included a $113.4 million gain on divested business. In 1995, it earned $720 million, or $5.39 per share, with a $1.05 billion gain. Sales last year were $5.20 billion, 13 percent below the previous year's $5.95 billion, which included $796.9 million from divested businesses. ""This was a rebound year in which our largest, value-driving businesses -- U.S. and Canadian foods and worldwide Gatorade -- increased their operating profits,"" Chairman William Smithburg said in a statement. A $100 million cutback in advertising and marketing costs in 1996 also helped results, analysts added. In a conference call, Smithburg said Quaker was committed to at least 10 percent real earnings growth in 1997. ""We're going to try like crazy to do even better than that,"" he said. Quaker management again pledged to turn around Snapple, which it bought over two years ago for $1.8 billion. ""We need to stabilise (Snapple's) volume"" in 1997, Smithburg said. ""Our goal is to operate Snapple at cash positive in 1997."" Cash positive means Snapple is expected to be profitable, excluding goodwill charges of about $50 million a year. Quaker surprised some analysts by not taking a charge in the fourth quarter to reduce Snapple's value. Analysts had expected Quaker to take a large writedown for Snapple, potentially as high as $1 billion. Smithburg declined to comment on speculation and rumours that Quaker was looking to sell Snapple, a fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business, and its Gatorade sports drink. He said Quaker's management continues to review steps to ""create value for shareholders,"" but declined to be specific. Gatorade, Quaker's largest brand, had a strong year in 1996, Smithburg said, with sales volume rising 6 percent in the fourth quarter and 4 percent year-to-date. Gatorade is launching this year a ""Frost"" line of Gatorade beverages that will feature a ""cooling taste,"" Smithburg said. ""The trade acceptance has been nothing short of terrific."" Smithburg said the company's hot cereals business had a strong year, with sales volume up 9 percent. Ready-to-eat cereals, such as Cap'n Crunch and Life, gained 3 percent in volume for 1996. The value-priced line of bagged cereals grew more than 40 percent in the year. Quaker stock was down 62.5 cents at $35.875 in afternoon trading. ","PatriciaCommins"
"Shares in brewing-to-leisure group Bass Plc are likely to be held back until Britain's Trade and Industry secretary Ian Lang decides whether to allow its proposed merge with brewer Carlsberg-Tetley, said analysts. Earlier Lang announced the Bass deal would be referred to the Monoplies and Mergers Commission which is due to report before March 24, 1997. The shares fell 6p to 781p on the news. ""The stock is probably dead in the water until March,"" said John Wakley, analyst at Lehman Brothers.   Dermott Carr, an analyst at Nikko said, ""the market is going to hang onto them for the moment but until we get a decision they will be held back."" Whatever the MMC decides many analysts expect Lang to defer a decision until after the next general election which will be called by May 22. ""They will probably try to defer the decision until after the election. I don't think they want the negative PR of having a large number of people fired,"" said Wakley.   If the deal does not go through, analysts calculate the maximum loss to Bass of 60 million, with most sums centred on the 30-40 million range. ""It's a maxiumum loss of 60 million for Bass if they fail and, unlike Allied, you would have to compare it to the perceived upside of doing the deal,"" said Wakley. Bass said at the time of the deal it would take a one-off charge of 75 million stg for restructuring the combined business, resulting in expected annual cost savings of 90 million stg within three years.   Under the terms of the complex deal, if Bass cannot combine C-T with its own brewing business within 16 months, it has the option to put its whole shareholding to Carlsberg for 110 million stg and Carlsberg has an option to put 15 percent of C-T to Allied Domecq, which would reimburse Bass 30 million stg. Bass is also entitled to receive 50 percent of all profits earnied by C-T until the merger is complete, which should give it some 30-35 million stg in a full year. Carlsberg has agreed to contribute its interests and 20 million stg in exchange for a 20 percent share in the combined Bass Breweries and Carlsberg-Tetley business. C-T was a joint venture between Allied Domecq and Carlsberg formed in 1992 by the merger of their UK brewing and wholesaleing businesses. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437 ","TimFarrand"
"Not content with disturbing your meals with sales calls, AT&amp;T Corp. will soon have salespeople arriving on your doorstep to explain why you should switch long-distance service to them. However, they will have been invited. The nation's dominant long-distance company on Thursday announced an alliance with Shaklee Corp. that will have Shaklee's 500,000 sales agents selling AT&amp;T phone service face-to-face across the nation from January 1997. The Shaklee sales representatives will sell to friends, colleagues and neighbors, never to strangers. ""Without question, this is a groundbreaking move for AT&amp;T,"" said Joseph Nacchio, executive vice president of AT&amp;T's consumer and small business division. Shaklee, part of Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Japan, currently sells nutritional supplements, personal care products, household cleaners, and water treatment products. It is particularly strong among ethnic minorities, non-English speakers and in inner cities. These markets can be tough to crack by other routes, but quite lucrative. ""Shaklee will help us expand our personal presence in communities exponentially and create a whole new network of representatives with roots in neighborhoods across the country,"" Nacchio said. To start with, Shaklee will sell only AT&amp;T's long-distance calling plans, but AT&amp;T wants to sell new services too once the sales force is trained on their complexities. ""AT&amp;T would like to give Shaklee that opportunity,"" said Shaklee spokeswoman Karin Topping. The move shows AT&amp;T is neither too big nor too proud to take a leaf out of the marketing books of its competitors. Small aggressive competitors like Excel Communications Inc. have powered their growth through exactly this kind of ""multi-level"" marketing. The approach is so named because each salesperson recruits others, and continues to benefit from their recruits' sales efforts as they rise up the hierarchy. MCI Communications Corp. has a similar relationship with direct sales organization Amway Corp. ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. And it certainly validates this sales strategy,"" said Eric Strumingher, industry analyst at brokers Chicago Corp. ""I think this could be very significant for AT&amp;T,"" he said. For AT&amp;T the alliance is aimed at reaching new customers cheaply, and keeping them. AT&amp;T's market share in the $70 billion long-distance market has sunk to about 55 percent from 90 percent over the last decade. They have been hit not only by traditional rivals MCI and Sprint Corp., but a host of tiny new competitors. Recent attempts to regain customers by offering $100 checks have been expensive but without increasing loyalty, so Thursday's initiative marks a new departure. ""We do believe the nature of this sales channel will be much more likely to increase loyalty and retention among customers,"" Jack McMaster, AT&amp;T's vice president for domestic consumer long distance, said in an interview. Shacklee salespeople sell to their friends and neighbors. Customers are expected to be more reluctant to switch away from a service recommended by a friend. ""It's potentially much more lucrative than selling lipstick or vitamin supplements for the salesperson,"" said David Goodtree, an analyst at consultancy Forrester Research. Shaklee said an average salesperson earns $14,000 a year part time, with earnings ranging from $1,000 a month at the entry level to six figures for the long-established. Shaklee said that cars and vacations would typically be incentives for upper echelon sales representatives. For AT&amp;T a crucial question will be the value of the customers won in terms of their long-distance spending, and the chances of selling new services like satellite television, pagers or mobile phones to them too. AT&amp;T wants all of Shacklee's half million salespeople to be involved with the program, which means they must be AT&amp;T customers themselves. ""It is our ambition that all of them will participate in this program,"" McMaster said. This will mean a boost of several hundred thousand good customers who will not be able to switch, even before the sales effort gets underway. ""Thats one of the reasons we are so excited about this,"" McMaster said. AT&amp;T's stock edged down 12.5 cents to $37.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. ","NickLouth"
"Up to one million tonnes of soybean meal is clogging Chinese ports, filling warehouses and forcing domestic prices down, traders said on Wednesday. ""There is no demand,"" said one U.S. trader. Of the million tonnes estimated to be sitting in Chinese ports, either on ships or in warehouses, 400,000 tonnes is in southern Guangdong, one source said. ""The market has dropped and the buyers are stuck with the meal,"" the source said. Feed mills were buying on a hand-to-mouth basis, keeping minimum stocks and hoping to squeeze desperate importers on the price, said a trader in Shanghai. ""When they find all the port stocks are consumed, they will start increasing their buying -- but that won't be for a while and who knows when,"" he said. Traders polled by Reuters varied in their view of just when the stocks would dwindle to a point that will inspire buying -- the optimists said late February, the pessimists plumbed for as late as July. In the meantime, the domestic Chinese price of soybean meal has plunged around 10 percent in the past six weeks, traders said, from 2,900-2,950 yuan ($349-355) a tonne, to 2,650-2,750 yuan ($319-331) a tonne now. Soybean meal prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) ended mostly firm on Tuesday, closing $2.40 per tonne higher to 30 cents lower, with March up $1.40 to $238.10 per tonne. Thai traders reported on Tuesday that Chinese buyers of Indian-origin soybean meal had defaulted on some cargoes because the market could not absorb the huge quantities on the way. China's soybean meal arrivals in the last quarter of 1996 were between one and 1.2 million tonnes, traders said, with loading and shipping delays pushing back the landing time of large quantities from South America and the United States. ""Our vessels with an ETA (estimated time of arrival) around mid-December all arrived in January,"" said the Shanghai source. Another said his company currently had vessels in four or five Chinese ports awaiting discharge and facing demurrage charges. A trading source in Singapore said 250,000 tonnes of meal was due to arrive and/or discharge at Chinese ports this month. On top of that, 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes of soybeans would be discharged in China before the Lunar New Year vacation begins on February 6, he said. ""It will be interesting to see how all this is absorbed by the market,"" another trading source said. Overbuying in 1996 and delayed arrivals were compounded by a decision in December by Heilongjiang province to allow the sale of unprocessed soybeans to other parts of the country for the first time in more than three years. Heilongjiang, in the far northeast, is China's biggest soybean producer, with 1996 output estimated at 4.135 million tonnes, down slightly from 1995. While prices in the province had suffered from the moratorium, the decision to lift the non-value-added sales ban had had little impact on farmers' prices, the U.S. source said. The Shanghai trader, however, said that fundamental demand in China for beans as food, rather than feed, kept prices steady. ""In Shanghai now, prices are 3,000 yuan (per tonne) for beans, and of that 2,600 goes back to Heilongjiang. That's not bad,"" he said. ","LynneO'Donnell"
"Japan's securities watchdog filed complaints with prosecutors on Tuesday alleging that Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Japan's biggest brokerage, and three former executives made illegal to payments to a client. While the regulators did not identify the client, he is believed to be one of Japan's ""sokaiya"" racketeers, who extort money from corporations by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings. Japan's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to such racketeers since 1982. Government sources said that the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) complaints allege that Nomura and the employees made illegal payments to the client totalling 49.7 million yen ($417,600). It was the first time that regulators have charged that the company was itself involved in the scandal. Nomura has repeatedly denied any participation in the scam, saying it was the work of three former executives. It is now up to prosecutors to determine if there is enough evidence to file charges in the case. In a sign that the probe may have a sweeping impact on Nomura, the SESC said that some of the improper orders were handled by more junior employees, which could bring more names into the scandal. Nomura issued a statement apologising for the scandal. ""We deeply apologise for the inconvenience the scandal has caused to our customers and the public,"" it said. ""We are taking the complaints seriously...We will make a 'fresh start' to prevent a recurrence of such events."" The government sources said the SESC would start drawing up proposals for civil penalties against Nomura immediately. But they added that it was too early to say how long it would take the SESC to present the proposals to the Finance Ministry. Market sources say the Finance Ministry may suspend part of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as punishment for the scandal. This would be the heaviest ever penalty imposed on a securities firm in Japan. The scandal has already casted a long shadow over Nomura's business and prompted many clients to shun the financial powerhouse. In March alone, Nomura's current profit dropped to about half the usual monthly levels due to the scandal, which cut its brokerage commissions and its share of the underwriting market, a company executive said in April. Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo bourse fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it had held since February 1992. In the first fallout from the SESC action, the Ministry of Finance said late on Tuesday that Nomura was being suspended from taking part in Japanese Government Bond auctions and underwriting activities. Nomura's admission in March that two of its directors were involved in transferring Nomura money into the account of a corporate client linked to a sokaiya racketeer was a major blow to the image of the Japanese brokering industry. In 1991, Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were found to be paying improper compensation to favoured clients. Top executives at Nomura resigned that year over payments and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters. Nomura made a sweeping reshuffle of its top management late last month in an effort to win back public trust in the wake of the scandal. ($1=119 yen) ","FumikoFujisaki"
"America Online Inc. was hit with two more lawsuits Wednesday from frustrated subscribers, and the world's largest online service also suffered a computer glitch that led it to shut down half of its system for nearly four hours. Late Wednesday, AOL's system suffered a partial outage when system problems led it to shut down half of its system from 3:45 p.m. EST until about 7:30 p.m. to find the problem. ""The system was able to accommodate 124,000 subscribers,"" an AOL spokeswoman said. Normally AOL, which has more than 7 million subscribers, accommodates about 258,000 users simultaneously. The problem was with an interface board in a router device, which manages the flow of data in a network, the company said. AOL said its network was back to full capacity by 8 p.m. EST. The spokeswoman said the outage was not related to the onslaught of member usage since AOL switched to unlimited use for a flat rate of $19.95 a month. AOL suffered another much more massive network outage in August last year, when the entire AOL network was down for almost 19 hours due to a software glitch. That outage drew front-page headlines around the world, as millions of users were unable to access electronic mail, the Internet, and a variety of services and publications online, for almost a day. While AOL said the latest network outage was not due to the influx of users, the current demand for its service is clearly testing the patience of some subscribers, who have begun filing lawsuits against AOL. On Wednesday, two more lawsuits were disclosed, both filed in New York state court this week, claiming breach of contract, deceptive trade practices and false advertising. Those suits came on the heels of a class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles on behalf of five subscribers, seeking damages for what they call fraudulent and malicious representation. In addition, at least two state attorneys general have confirmed they are in discussions with America Online, seeking some resolution to complaints they have received from consumers about the continuing problem of network access. New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco and Wisconsin state Attorney General Jim Doyle are in discussions with AOL, spokesmen said. Since AOL switched its more than 7 million members to unlimited access for $19.95 a month, its network has been deluged by subscribers, many of whom cannot log onto the system during peak evening hours or on weekends. The spokeswoman for the Dulles, Va.-based company could not immediately comment on the New York lawsuits, but on Tuesday, AOL said it was upgrading its network and that it understood its users' frustration. ""Although we understand the frustration some members are experiencing ... the average AOL member gets more value under unlimited pricing than ever before,"" AOL said in response to the Los Angeles lawsuit. Many Wall Street and industry analysts said they are not worried about the lawsuits, which they consider frivolous. ","TheresePoletti"
"Interest rates on British home loans may rise this year due to upward pressure on savings rates, even if a new government does not immediately tighten monetary policy, analysts said on Thursday. This is a separate issue from the question of whether the government should raise interest rates to nip inflation in the bud after the general election on May 1, they said. The flotation of four building societies and the takeover of another will free as much as 140 billion pounds ($225 billion) of savings locked in nearly 30 million accounts in the societies, which provide home mortages. This is around 25 percent of British retail savings and analysts expect a good proportion of this to be moved. ""I expect 15 billion pounds to be moved as a conservative estimate,"" said UBS building societies analyst Rob Thomas. ""The effect will be to push up savings rates and, since mortgage lending is largely funded from savings, mortgage margins will come under pressure and rates may rise."" Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender with 20 percent of the market; Woolwich ; Alliance &amp; Leicester and Northern Rock are ending their mutual society status and floating on the stock market. Savers had to deposit money in these building societies to qualify for free shares. But once the societies have floated, savers can move their money where they want. The societies will have to fight hard to keep hold of the money as other institutions such as Abbey National and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, part of the Lloyds TSB Group want to grab a big chunk of the cash. Analysts expect a fair proportion of the money to flow into pure spending or to other financial products such as unit trusts. But they also expect a large amount to be up for grabs within the savings and loan industry. On Wednesday, Abbey National, which converted to bank status and floated in 1990, pointedly noted that much of the money can already be moved as members have already qualified for shares. The Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, proclaiming its continued mutual ownership, said it would effectively raise savings rates and cut mortgage rates. Thomas of UBS said the spread between mortgage rates and base rated was low historically following mortgage rate cuts in 1995 which outstripped an easing base rate. Pressure on savings rates could trigger a rise for borrowers if institutions want to maintain margin which has already been difficult to do. ""This might even result in a round of mortgage rate rises not associated with a base rate rise,"" Thomas said. David Poutney, banking analyst at Panmure Gordon expects the situation to be an opportunity for banks such as Abbey National. ""While competitive pressure will increase, the freeing up of the market will increase new business opportunities for the likes of the Abbey,"" he said. ($ = 0.624 British Pounds) ","JoeOrtiz"
"Kellogg Co., in a move to broaden its breakfast food business and help offset sluggish cereal sales, said Monday it will acquire the Lender's Bagels business from Kraft Foods Inc. for $455 million. Lender's, based in White Plains, N.Y., is the nation's largest maker of fresh and frozen bagels sold in grocery stores, with annual sales of about $275 million. Kraft is owned by Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the New York-based food and tobacco giant. ""Lender's Bagels is a perfect fit for Kellogg Company's fast-growing convenience foods business,"" Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said. ""With our heritage based in nutrition and our technical competence in grain-based food products, adding the nation's number one brand in bagels ... offers substantial new opportunities to grow our business,"" he said in a statement. Analysts said the deal would extend Kellogg's reach into America's breakfast pantry by moving it into the fast-growing bagel business, with sales estimated at about $2.8 billion a year. In addition to being the world's largest maker of ready-to-eat breakfast cereal, Kellogg also makes Pop-Tarts toaster pastries, Eggo frozen waffles and Nutri-Grain breakfast bars. ""It's a good fit in that it is a breakfast business,"" said Goldman Sachs (corrects from Salomon Brothers) analyst Nomi Ghez.  ""It recognizes that the cereal market has matured, and other areas are eating into it. They have to move into those other areas."" The deal, expected to close by year-end, includes Lender's plants in New Haven, Conn.; Mattoon, Ill., and Buffalo, N.Y., Kellogg said. But the acquisition is not big enough to halt the erosion in Kellogg's mainstay cereal business, analysts said. Price cuts of about 19 percent this year have failed to boost demand, and Kellogg's cereal sales fell as much as 15 percent in the third quarter due to stiff competition, they said. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Monday cut its ratings outlook for $1.3 billion in Kellogg corporate debt to negative from stable because it believes the company will have difficulty in recapturing lost sales and improving profits. Kellogg's earlier this month warned that its first quarter 1997 profits will likely fall below the year-earlier results. Kellogg stock fell 12.5 cents to $68.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. At a price of more than 1.5 times Lender's sales, the acquisition will depress Kellogg's earnings slightly in 1997, Ghez estimated. It should boost profits in 1998, she said. Joseph Stewart, Kellogg's senior vice president of corporate affairs, said the company sees long-term growth prospects for Lender's Bagels, which has 45 percent of the nation's prepackaged bagel market. ""This is a long-term positive proposition to build shareholder value,"" Stewart said. Kraft, based in Northfield, Ill., is the nation's largest packaged food company with revenues of $16 billion. Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., has annual sales of about $7 billion. ","DavidLawder"
"Glaxo Wellcome Plc reported an 18 percent jump in 1996 pre-tax profit on Thursday but said it faced two lean years after its biggest-selling drug Zantac loses its U.S. patent in July. Pre-tax profits at the world's number one prescription drugs company climbed to 2.964 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) from 2.505 billion, in the middle of analysts' expectations. Sales rose nine percent to 8.341 billion pounds and shareholders were rewarded with a 13 percent rise in the dividend to 34.0 pence. Despite a forecast of flat profits for 1997 and 1998 as a result of an anticipated plunge in sales of ulcer treatment Zantac, the group's shares ended the day 11-1/2 pence higher at 10.48 pounds, recovering from early falls. Analysts said they were encouraged by the performance from the group's management, which is confident it can ride out the collapse of Zantac, the best-selling drug on which Glaxo built its international fortune. Glaxo boldly predicted a return to double-digit sales growth in 1999, pinning its hopes on drugs for AIDs, asthma and migraine and promising 20 new product launches over the next four years. SocGen's director of equity research, Paul Diggle, said Glaxo Wellcome had gone a long way to answering the question of whether it was ""a becalmed giant that through patent expiries is going to be hard-pressed to grow...or a serious growth player which faces a bit of a dip."" BZW analyst Steve Plag added: ""We think that by the end of 1998 Glaxo Wellcome will be one of the strongest drug companies in the industry."" Sales of Zantac slipped 14 percent last year as competition began to bite around the world but at 1.931 billion pounds they continued to make it the world's biggest-selling drug, a spot it has held since 1986. The company said sales of Zantac in the U.S. market, which topped one billion pounds last year, could plunge by up to 80 percent in the first year of full competition. ""The tough period is mid-1997 to mid-1998, when Zantac will come under severe generic pressure in the U.S.,"" deputy chairman and chief executive Sir Richard Sykes told Reuters. But he added: ""If you take Zantac out, we have a 6.4 billion sterling business growing at 14 percent. That underlying growth is a very clear indication of the strength of the group going forward."" He said sales of Zantac fell by 324 million pounds last year, while a portfolio of newer products launched since 1990 saw sales rise by 650 million pounds to 2.0 billion pounds. The group's top performers last year included its rejuvenated HIV and AIDs treatments, whose sales doubled to nearly 500 million pounds. Retrovir and Epivir are cornerstones of new cocktails of drugs that have shown startling success in reducing virus levels, giving Glaxo a 57 percent share of the fast-expanding AIDs market. Other big sellers included asthma drugs Serevent and Flixotide, which notched up combined sales of more than 500 million pounds, and migraine drug Imigran, which saw sales in the U.S. market alone leap by 69 percent last year. Sales of the group's second-biggest product, herpes treatment Zovirax, which has already lost most of its key patents, were steady at 812 million pounds. Despite persistent speculation that Glaxo Wellcome, formed after Glaxo's nine billion pound acquisition of Wellcome in 1995, would hit the acquisition trail again when debt levels allowed, Sykes said the pressure for mega-mergers had dissipated. ""The bigger companies get, the more difficult it is to buy them or merge, so the way forward will be much more looking at regional and local opportunities and building these as opportunities come along,"" he added.

"Britain's biggest chemical company ICI said on Thursday that profits collapsed last year, but it set its sights on a more profitable future with plans to float its troubled tioxide operations on the stock exchange. Profits before tax and exceptional charges dropped 37 percent to 603 million pounds ($967 million) in 1996 from 951 million a year before, while the dividend payout climbed 6.7 percent to 32.0 pence. Both figures were towards the bottom end of market expectations. The company blamed the drop on sharp cyclical price falls in the overcrowded chlorine, titanium dioxide (tioxide) and polyester markets, higher oil prices and a stronger pound. Some of the downturn was offset by a bouyant performance in the fast-expanding paints business, where operating profits jumped 60 percent to 171 million stg, and a steady performance in materials, which makes acrylics and polyurethanes. Shares in the group reacted erratically to the results, rising briefly to a peak of 780 pence before slipping back 10 pence to 754-1/2 in late-morning trade. Traders said upbeat forecasts on prospects for chemical prices and news of the Tioxide float were overshadowed by continued worries over the strength of sterling and disappointment over the full-year figures. The results reinforced the group's determination to reposition itself as a producer of ""light"" chemicals like acrylics, polyurethanes and paints and to move away from the less predictable industrial end of the market. A reshuffle of the board's responsibilites on Thursday signalled the change, and finance director Alan Spall told Reuters ICI would be ""a very different company"" by the turn of the century. Spall said ICI planned to float the Tioxide Group, which is the world's second biggest producer of tioxide, a whitening agent for for paints, plastics, inks and fibres, in the next 18 months. The company is consulting advisors about its value, but Spall said its net assets totalled around $700 million. ""We are determined to reduce the proportion of assets and income from the heavy industrial end,"" Spall told Reuters. ""You can expect us to use every tool around to shift the portfolio,"" he added, including flotations, asset swaps, sales and acquisitions. He said the entire chemical industry was in talks on swapping key assets and pointed to Wednesday's $30 million acquisition of a Puerto Rico paint company and last year's purchase of Bunge Paints in South America as the kind of move that could be expected. ""There is a whole series of potential acquistions,"" said Spall. ICI belieives that the downward spiral in key industrial chemical prices is now at an end. Spall predicted a ""sharp"" rise in tioxide prices this year, and said prices of olefins and chlorofins were now improving. ""1997 chemical production and demand looks better...the balance will tighten,"" he said. ($1=.6237 Pound) ","JonathanBirt"
"Intel Corp., the world's biggest maker of computer chips, said Tuesday its workers received about $820 million in cash bonuses, profit sharing and retirement pay for the company's record year in 1996. ""The average employee received a minimum of about 33 percent payout over their base salary for the year -- about four months of extra income,"" Intel Chief Operating Officer Craig Barrett told reporters in a conference call. For an entry-level hourly worker earing $25,000 a year, the combined package of added compensation and benefits for last year amounts to roughly $8,000 extra, Intel said. ""We think it's also been a phenomenal benefit to our shareholders by motivating our employees to do the best possible job they can for our shareholders and our customers,"" said Barrett, who will become Intel's president this spring. Intel said the $820 million in 1996 cash profit-sharing and retirement contributions exceeded the company's total 1981 revenues and was roughly equal to its 1991 net income. Profits at the Santa Clara-based semiconductor company, which supplies the microprocessors used in four out of every five personal computers shipped, last year soared to $5.2 billion as revenues hit $20.8 billion. Barrett said he did not begrudge employees any of the extra benefits from contributing to record results, and the company now plans to make all its employees eligible for stock options beginning with its next plan, which starts in April. ""This outstanding year would not have been possible without the remarkable efforts of Intel employees around the world,"" said Barrett, heir apparent to Intel CEO Andy Grove. Intel ended 1996 with a workforce of around 48,500. Separately, Intel Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant told an investment conference in New York City that Intel remained on track in the first quarter to meet its financial targets, as personal computer unit sales continue to grow. The stock of Intel closed up 12.5 cents at $151.75 on the Nasdaq market, where it was third most heavily-traded. Barrett said the company last year paid out $214 million, or the equivalent of 26.9 days' salary for each Intel employee, under the Employee Cash Bonus Programme. All employees receive the cash profit-sharing in six-month instalments. In 1996, the company also extended its Employee Bonus profitability-based programme to all employees. The plan, based on growth in Intel earnings and achievement of an employee's business group goals, paid out a total of $360 million. A one-time bonus marking Intel's record-breaking year paid $1,000 to each U.S. employee and a locally adjusted figure to each non-U.S. employee, or a total of $45 million. Intel said that for the ninth consecutive year it contributed the maximum allowed by law to its employee retirement programme, or 12.5 percent of employees' pay -- a figure which totalled about $200 million. Intel has sought to build one of the corporate world's most innovative compensation and benefits packages as a way of attracting top employees and to reward them for contributing to the company's long-term growth and profitability. Intel, whose shares have vaulted 180 percent in the past year despite moribund results at many rival semiconductor companies, said it was one of only a small number of companies to have instituted an across-the-board options plan. Even the lowest-level hourly workers will receive options to buy a minimum of 50 shares in a five-year plan in which the employee gains one-fifth of the allotment each year. Barrett said Intel also spends roughly 6 percent to 7 percent of its payroll, or around $150 million, on employee training each year to help employees advance in their careers. Barrett said Intel's generous compensation plan and the hardships at other companies resulted in lower jobs turnover last year. He declined to specify the exact turnover rate, but said ""We're in the relatively low single-digit range."" ","SamuelPerry"
"Britain's Scottish Amicable on Thursday defended the multi-million pound fees paid to banking advisers as part of its 2.87 billion pound ($4.7 billion) takeover by life insurer Prudential Corp. The comments came as ScotAm, based in the Scottish city of Stirling, published details of the proposed transfer of business to the Pru and benefits to policyholders as part of the acquistion plans. A policyholder circular outlining the proposals will be mailed to members over the next week. The plans have to be approved by voting members at a special general meeting to be held on June 27. Gavin Stewart, general manger of the Scottish-based mutual insurer, admitted the cost of the deal, estimated at 34 million pounds, was a lot of money but said it was important to get things right. It was always expensive to demutualise, he said, and had to be seen in the context of similar moves by building socities. Norwich Union recently put the costs of its  plans to drop mutual status and its five billion pound flotation next month at 120 million pounds. The amounts paid by ScotAm covered not only advisory fees for bankers SBC Warburg but all the logistical costs of posting circulars to more than a million policyholders and holding special meetings, said Stewart. Around 1.1 million members stand to receive cash payments averaging 550 pounds and a total package of 1,450 pounds once additional bonuses to policies are taken into account. All qualifying with-profits members will receive a fixed cash payment of 250 pounds with a further variable amount based on the size and duration of the policy. Assuming ScotAm gets the necessary approval of three-quarters of members' who vote and the go-ahead from the Court of Session in Edinburgh, it hopes to pay cash and bonuses shortly after the completion of the deal on September 30. ""We're convinced this is an excellent deal for policyholders. 600 million pounds is being paid out in cash and one billion pounds as added value in bonuses on to policies - about half now and half added to policies when they pay out,"" said Stewart. ""We think policyholders when they see the deal will recognise the value and will be pleased to vote for it."" In all, the cash and bonus payments amount to 1.6 billion pounds. In addition, the Pru is to inject 1.3 billion pounds of financial support to enable increased investment freedom for the ScotAm with profits fund, enhancing the potential for better returns. ScotAm policies are to be transferred to the Pru and held in a dedicated fund, serviced from ScotAm's headquarters. The Pru beat off rival offers from Abbey National and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) to win control of ScotAm and reinforce its position as Britain's number one fund manager. The poilcyholders circular will lay out details of the rejected Abbey and AMP bids. ScotAm chairman Sandy Stewart said the bidding process had produced a high value for the business and a full distribution of the assets in the with-profits fund to with-profits policyholders. ""The members of ScotAm now have the opportunity to vote for a package which will provide additional financial security and the prospect of improved future investment returns leading to enhanced payouts,"" said chairman Stewart.

"Russian oil-for-sugar barter deals with Cuba, a staple of trade between the two countries since Soviet times, have soured as market economy principles intrude upon leftover communist-era practices. Once a swap unencumbered by inconveniences like volatile commodities prices and competitive supplies from other countries, the practice has come up against cold realities that have stalled old deals and raised questions about how new ones will be implemented. Players on the Russian side said on Wednesday that the last barter arrangement for 1996 had yet to be completed, and that one of the Russian commodities houses implementing the old deal had lost money on it and would likely not do future deals. ""We are not talking now about new deals. No way,"" said a source at Alfa-Eko, which with Menatep-Impex, another Russian powerhouse commodities trader, is implementing the 1996 deal. The Alfa-Eko source said the only talks taking place were on how to resolve sticky issues left over from the 1996 deal, which has carried into 1997 due to disputes stemming from high world oil prices and low prices for refined sugar in Russia. He said Alfa-Eko still owed Havana about 200,000 tonnes of oil and was owed about half as much cane sugar. ""The talks are about whether we should go ahead and deliver or just settle the matter amicably,"" he said. The barter practice goes back to the 1960s, when Soviet Moscow sold cheap oil to Havana, bought a major portion of the Cuban sugar cane crop at wildly-inflated prices, and even picked up Cuba's bad credits when poor harvests sent Havana scrambling onto world markets in search of supplies. Today, the game is no longer about helping the communist holdout in the Carribean, but about making money. Havana resells the crude oil on world markets, while Russian sugar refineries get a steady feedstock. The deals are carried out according to ratios linked to world commodities prices, and private Alfa-Eko and Menatep have replaced the Russian government in carrying out the schemes. ""It's all about the ratios, which are linked to world prices for oil and sugar,"" said a senior Menatep-Impex source, adding that the ratio formulas were a commercial secret. Menatep said it would complete its portion of the 1996 deal, under which it owes several hundred thousand tonnes of oil and will get about half as much sugar, in the first quarter of 1997. But it has not been easy. Cheap Ukrainian refined sugar has flooded into Russia, creating a glut that has pressured prices and forced Alfa-Eko and Menatep to rethink how they can make money on the schemes. ""Honestly, we still have sugar in storage, and the fees are killing us,"" said the Alfa-Eko source. ""We're not doing anything right now -- the market is not favourable."" The Menatep source said Menatep would do all of the 1997 deals and that Alfa-Eko was quitting the business. The two sides already have a three-year arrangement covering 1996-1998 that Moscow and Havana signed in 1995. That is in addition to the separate 1996 deal still being carried out. According to Interfax news agency last year, the three-year deal envisaged Russia selling Cuba 2.1 million tonnes of oil in 1996, 3.9 million in 1997 and 4.5 million in 1998. In return, Russia would get 750,000 tonnes of Cuban raw sugar for 1996, 1.5 million in 1997 and 1.75 million in 1998. With oil prices at highs and Russian refined sugar prices at lows, the ratios will likely change, leaving somebody in tears. But even with volatile prices, some things have not changed. ""The deals are still relevant,"" the Menatep source said. ""Russia needs this sugar, which is tough to get in these volumes on the free market, where certain traders have dug in. ""Cubans as trading partners are a very particular type. We're used to them. We've got all sorts of Soviet-era specialists working for us. Alfa-Eko has more of a Western mentality -- and that is why they have lost."" ","LynnleyBrowning"
"Strong business fundamentals and a presumed change in the shareholder profile of Wallace Computer Services Inc should protect it from a bid by investor Guy Wyser-Pratte to remove the company's poison pill takeover defense, analysts said. ""I think they've done a terrific job of creating shareholder value and I think it will come out at some time,"" said Judith Scott, analyst at Robert W. Baird.   Meanwhile, many arbitrageurs likely sold their Wallace stock after Moore Corp Ltd said in early August it was abandoning its 13-month takeover campaign, analysts said. ""Since August 6, you've had a substantial change in the profile of the Wallace shareholder base,"" said Martin McDevitt Jr., analyst at Cleary Gull Reiland and McDevitt.  ""Most of the selling since the early part of August is on behalf of arbitrageurs."" McDevitt conceded that he could not say for sure how much of the selling in the stock has been from arbitrageurs.   But he argued that the shareholder base is probably more composed of shareholders looking for a longer-term return. His 12-15 month price target for Wallace is $36-$40 a share, with other analysts in the $35-$36 range. The stock was unchanged at 27-1/4 Thursday. After Moore withdrew its bid, Wyser-Pratte, who controls a 2.3 percent stake in Wallace, filed proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to have three directors elected to Wallace's board.  He is also seeking the repeal a bylaw requiring an 80 percent vote to approve certain mergers.   In an interview, Wyser-Pratte argued that while Wallace shareholders could have received $60 a share from Moore a year ago, the stock, on a pro forma basis adjusting for a stock split, is trading just above $54. But analysts counter that the company posted higher than expected earnings of $1.60 a share in the fiscal year ended July 31 and that the stock price should improve after uncertainty over the Wyser-Pratte proposals subsides. ""We think over the next three to five years, the company can grow 15 percent a year on the bottom line,"" McDevitt said.   But while forecasting better results and a higher stock price for the company, not all analysts are convinced Wyser-Pratte will be unsuccessful in having the poison pill defense removed. Kenneth Bohringer, analyst at Prudential Securities Research, noted that 59.8 percent of Wallace's shares were tendered to Moore's bid last year. ""I would assume that going forward, they can expect challenges to the poison pill,"" he said. ""But I think that they have been vindicated by the performance they put together over the last year."" --Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787 ","BradDorfman"
"The Treasury may well take over regulation of insurance companies from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) under the Labour government's plans for sweeping reform of Britain's financial services, industry observers said on Thursday. Spokesmen for both the DTI and Treasury said that no decision had yet been made on the changes, but that this could form part of the new government's shake-up of financial regulation. Such a move would bring insurance into line with the rest of the financial services sector. ""If the Treasury is responsible for all other aspects of regulation of insurance it would be only sensible,"" said one industry executive. The steady erosion of the boundaries between insurance and banking industries has also increased the pressure to bring the supervisory regimes closer together. Many banks are beginning to offer insurance products while insurers are increasingly providing services such as savings facilities, personal loans and mortgages. At present the DTI regulates insurance companies,  ensuring they are financially sound and meet solvency requirements. Regulation of products is separate. General insurance is regulated by an industry code of practice and life products by the Financial Services Act, which is to be replaced by fresh legislation arising out of framework reforms announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown on Tuesday. While British insurers may have given a cautious welcome to the announcement of the regulatory shake-up, they have, as yet, little information on how far the government will go. But many in the industry admit the logic of doing away with the current multi-tiered system. The creation of a single statutory body, a Securities and Invesments Board (SIB) with enhanced powers and extended remit, could reduce costs, improve transparency and clarify uncertainties which have developed under the present set-up where insurers may be regulated by several different watchdogs. It could also give a much needed boost to public confidence, after a series of scandals typified by the pension mis-selling of the late 1980s and early 1990s which have undermined public perceptions of the sector. Britain's financial services market operates on the principle of ""buyer beware"", with regulators focusing on the solvency of practitioners. The market is left to regulate product suitability, with consumers having to shop around for a good deal. As the pensions mis-selling scandal showed, this was a less than perfect system from the customer's point of view. Both the SIB and the Personal Investments Authority (PIA), the self regulatory organisation currently responsible for the industry, have come in for severe criticism of their handling of the scandal. Hundreds of thousands of people were wrongly advised to take out personal pensions rather than stay in company or other occupational schemes and many have yet to receive compensation. Underlining the problems that have beset the sector in recent years a leaked draft report from the SIB on Wednesday accused Britain's largest life insurer, Prudential Corp of mis-selling financial products and wrongly advising clients to put money into one of its most popular products, The Prudential Savings Account. While insurers acknowledge the benefits of dealing with a single regulator, there are fears that the government may introduce tighter controls on products and selling. Only last week, Britain's National Consumer Council called for urgent and wholesale reform of insurance law to ""drag it into the 21st century and redress the balance for consumers"". A Treasury spokesman said it was too early to say whether detailed legislation on the selling of products would be included in the reform. With the private sector likely to play a larger part in the provision of pensions in the future, tighter regulation would seem to fit in with the government's long term plans, said industry observers.

"The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) issued forecasts for 1997 on Monday predicting a slight economic upturn, but analysts issued warnings about the rapidly growing trade and current account deficits. After a sluggish 1996, the CSU said it expected real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 1997 of 4.0-5.0 percent following an estimated 4.1 percent in 1996. Average annual inflation should ease to 7.5-8.0 percent from 8.8 percent, it forecast. The CSU added in its wide range of forecasts that the current account deficit, spurred by a spiralling trade gap, should grow to 137-145 billion crowns from an estimated 110.6 billion crown ($4 billion) shortfall in 1996. Analysts said the figures were more or less in line with expectations, but said that the widening current account and trade deficits -- both seen growing to record levels in 1997 -- could undermine the economy. ""I think they are credible forecasts, but not very encouraging,"" said David Lubin, an economist at HSBC Midland. ""It's okay for a country to run a current account deficit of nine percent of GDP but only if you believe in the future the economy will generate trade surpluses big enough to repay the debt that's being accumulated to finance the deficits,"" he told Reuters. According to the CSU estimates, the current account shortfall should be 8.6-9.1 percent of GDP in 1997. It forecast the trade deficit would widen to 202-212 billion crowns from a deficit of 160.3 billion last year. At the heart of the trade gap was a 12.7 percent rise in imports in 1996, due largely to firms investing in new machinery and materials which are badly needed for post-communist economic restructuring. Exports stagnated, rising only 3.5 percent for the year. But the CSU said it expected them to grow 4.5-6.5 percent in 1997, while import growth should ease slightly to 9-12 percent. ""Some improvement (in imports) can be expected only in the second half of 1997 due to the influence of investment in new technologies and some pro-export measures,"" the CSU said. But analysts say it is still too soon to know if the vast imports of machinery and materials in 1996 will be properly put to use, and whether managers can make their new capital goods translate into a more competitive industrial sector and cover the deficit currently being run up. ""I'm not sure that the Czech economy is making sufficient progress at the corporate level, the micro-economic level, to generate those trade surpluses,"" said one local economist. ""It seems to me that the Czech economy still has a sort of fundamental competitiveness problem,"" he added. After fighting through a recent downturn, the Czech Republic's largest trading partner, Germany, appears poised to make a recovery in 1997. Government officials have often said that this should help sagging Czech exports. But if the German economy does warm up, the Bundesbank may raise interest rates to keep it from overheating, attracting back funds which have flooded into the Czech Republic and bolstered its capital account. ""What they gain on the current account on the balance of payments from the German upturn, they might lose somewhat on the capital account,"" Lubins said. The CSU said growth in average nominal wages -- a factor the central bank has said must be brought under control if inflation targets are to be met -- is expected to be 14.5-16.5 percent, down from the 1996 forecast increase of 18.4 percent. Some analysts, however, said the drop might not be enough to stem inflationary pressures. ""This (wage growth) is much more than this economy can afford -- maybe around 12 percent is acceptable,"" said Vladimir Kriedl, an economist at Patria Finance. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($ = 27.65 Czech Crowns) ","AlanCrosby"
"Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, outlining a plan to overhaul Depression-era laws governing the U.S. financial sector, said Wednesday the Clinton administration favored allowing banks to enter the securities and insurance fields. ""The old lines that separated insurance, securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared,"" Rubin said in a speech here. The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, takes its place with several bills already introduced in Congress. ""We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative,"" Rubin said. Increased competition in financial services should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, Rubin said. The new proposal did not take a firm position on the controversial question of allowing banks to combine with non-financial, commercial firms. ""Because of the nature of the issues and the complete lack of consensus, we think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress before settling on a final approach,"" Rubin said. Some lawmakers, along with smaller banks and consumer groups, adamantly oppose allowing banks to combine with commercial firms. But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted. Rubin outlined two possible approaches. Under one approach, some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded. Under a second approach, no mixing would be allowed with banks but, as currently permitted, thrifts would be allowed to combine with  commercial firms. If banks are allowed to mix with commercial firms, the reforms could take effect two years after enactment, Rubin said. If mixing is not allowed, the reforms could take effect in nine months. The Federal Reserve should continue to oversee bank holding companies, while specific activities would be overseen by specific regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators. Banks would be allowed to underwrite municipal revenue bonds. An exemption for banks in the federal mutual fund law, the Investment Company Act, would be narrowed. ","AaronPressman"
"British commercial TV giant Granada Group on Wednesday tabled a formal 711 million pound ($1.2 billion) agreed bid for its neighbour Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television although some shareholders remained opposed the price. (corrects dollar conversion). Yorkshire Tyne-Tees Chairman Ward Thomas called on institutional investor Mercury Asset Management to rethink its opposition to the 11.75 pound per share bid, which he said was a good price. ""I hope on reflection they will come into line,"" he told Reuters in an interview, adding that any speculation that a counter bidder may offer a higher price might well be ""just poppycock"". MAM, who Thomas said had been the most vocal opponent of the takeover price, declined to comment amid speculation that it had bought some of its five percent Yorkshire stake at 13 pounds a share. Thomas said he had received no indication from United News &amp; Media Plc about how the company would vote its 14 percent Yorkshire stake amid talk that managing director Clive Hollick may launch a counter bid. ""I've no idea whether Clive Hollick will or not,"" said Ward. ""But I would have thought his target is much more likely to be HTV Group Plc. ""But if he does, well the shareholders will be happy and MAM will be right and I will be wrong."" Granada, which already owns 27 percent of Yorkshire, is offering two new Granada shares and 1,825.32 pence in cash for every three Yorkshire shares -- an offer Thomas said he had agreed to by telephone while on a holiday in the South of France just over two weeks ago. The companies said that Yorkshire would pay an interim dividend of 7.5 pence. Thomas said in the offer statement that although Yorkshire had fully recovered from problems that beset it in 1993 -- when it plunged into the red and its share price collapsed to around 1.20 pounds -- it was operating in an increasingly competitive market. ""As a result, your board now believes that a combination with the Granada broadcasting business is in the best interest of shareholders and will safeguard the future of Yorkshire and Tyne Tees Television and their ability to provide for the areas they serve,"" he said. Shares in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees traded were slightly firmer after a sobering trading statement limited gains, rising 2.5p to 1,157.5p having earlier scaled to a high of 11.70 pounds. ""What's hurting the (Yorkshire) shares is its trading statement...It's a pretty damning indictment of what's happening,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named. Yorkshire said it expected a disappointing second quarter, citing lower-than-expected growth in ITV advertising revenue and a failure to increase market share. The statement also said the company believed total advertising revenue growing for commercial television ITV would show only minimal growth during the first half of 1997. It blamed the slowdown on the launch of a new channel and industry-wide weakness. Granada chairman Gerry Robinson remained unperturbed, and said the two companies' existing airtime and international programme sales arrangements provided a solid foundation for a merger. ""We believe that the strategic arguments in favour of the combination are both powerful and widely accepted,"" he said. Granada, whose interests span broadcasting, leisure, hotels and catering, owns the independent television (ITV) franchise for north-west England, which is adjacent to Yorkshire's area. The deal will need regulatory approval, and Robinson said earlier this month he believed it would take some two months to complete even if everything went smoothly.

"A former U.S. surgeon general will testify in a class-action trial that cigarette makers blunted efforts in the 1970s to warn Americans on the dangers of second-hand smoke, a plaintiffs' lawyer said Monday. Dr. Jesse Steinfeld and another former surgeon general not yet named will testify on behalf of an estimated 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants claiming damages for illnesses allegedly caused by second-hand smoke on passenger jets, attorney Stanley Rosenblatt said.  Surgeon general is the highest medical post in the federal government.   A jury trial in Dade County Court is scheduled to begin on June 2 and will be the first class-action suit to come to trial in the United States against the tobacco industry.  It is but one case in a wide courtroom assault on cigarette makers. In a class-action suit, used in the past against asbestos makers on behalf of victims of lung diseases, a small group seeks damages on behalf of a much larger number of people with like injuries. A second class-action suit on behalf of all Florida smokers is scheduled for trial in Miami in September.   ""He will testify that the tobacco industry did everything it could to impede the information from getting to the public, from getting to the scientific community,"" Rosenblatt said, referring to Steinfeld during a pre-trial hearing. Steinfeld is also scheduled to testify for Mississippi, whose attorney general is suing tobacco companies to recoup the cost of treating sick smokers through its Medicaid program. Twenty-one other states, including Florida, have filed similar suits.   Rosenblatt accuses Philip Morris Cos Inc and other leading cigarette makers of purposely misleading Americans and conspiring with one another on hiding the medical risks of second-hand smoke to sustain corporate profits. Rosenblatt gave no details of the promised testimony.  No opposing lawyer representing tobacco companies at the hearing commented on Rosenblatt's statement, which came during a dispute over the exchange of witness lists. Other spokesmen for the tobacco industry were not immediately available.   Susan Rosenblatt, the second member of the husband-and-wife legal team bring the class-action suit, said the plaintiffs will also call a former tobacco company employee.  The witness has said under pre-trial questioning that he was instructed to destroy scientific findings pointing to the health risks of second-hand smoke, she said. The plaintiffs, who include Norma Brion, a non-smoking flight attendant for 13 years diagnosed with lung cancer, also will call an Australian cardiologist who will tesify that his research linking second-hand smoke and heart diseases was blocked by tobacco companies, the Rosenblatts said.   Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye said at the hearing he may name an outside lawyer to review some 1,500 industry documents the Rosenblatts want for the trial.  The tobacco lawyers oppose the use of the documents, the great bulk are not public. Kaye also extended until March 24 a deadline for the Rosenblatts to deliver a list of witnesses to tobacco-industry lawyers.  Hugh Whiting, a tobacco company lawyer, said the delay was harming his industry's defense.

"Investigators of Thursday's Delta Comair crash were trying to determine on Saturday the nature of what they called ""an unexplained event"" shortly before the plane plummeted to the ground killing 29 people. ""Approximately one minute after leveling off at 4,000 ft (1,200 m) an unexplained event took place, normal operations ceased and the airplane crashed shortly thereafter,"" John Hammerschmidt, the National Transportation Safety Board chief spokesman told a news conference. ""At this juncture, it is an event we are trying to understand,"" he added. NTSB investigators said they had determined something happened from listening to the ""black box"" cockpit voice recorder, but they refused to tell reporters what the pilots said. Investigators were still reviewing the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder boxes at their laboratory in Washington D.C., said Hammerschmidt, who added that nothing had been ruled out in trying to determine the cause. ""The cockpit voice recorder indicated an uneventful routine orderly businesslike flight,"" he added. Flight 3272 was enroute to Detroit from Cincinnati when it went down about 25 miles (40 kms) south of the airport in rural Monroe County in southeast Michigan on Thursday, killing 28 adults and one infant. Hammerschmidt said eye-witnesses reported seeing the plane's wings rock (corrects from ""lock"") before it plunged out of the sky. He said there was apparently a large amount of wing rocking (corrects from ""locking"") after which the plane briefly stabilised. ""They all indicated that the airplane stabilised, then the nose of the aircraft abruptly pitched down and descended vertically to the ground,"" he said. Hammerschmidt said the NTSB had learned that 20 minutes after the crash the pilot of a DC3 aircraft reported icing 25 miles southwest of Detroit airport. He said the previous crew of the doomed plane had on at least two occasions earlier in the day successfully used the entire de-icing system of the plane. He said there were no strong winds at the time of the accident, cloud cover was at 1500 feet (457.2 metres) and visibility was one to three miles (1.6 to 4.8 km).

Both engines of the plane showed they were rotating and working on impact and all eight power blades showed damage consistent with fact they were rotating on impact. Some observers had suggested the crash could have been caused by broken propeller blades. Propeller problems have been blamed for two previous fatal crashes involving the Brasilia model. the Monroe county medical examiner said there were still remains to be removed and that the identification process was expected to begin on Saturday.

"British insurer Norwich Union looks set to make a sparkling debut when its shares start trading on the stock market on Monday. On flotation the company, which has more than seven million customers, is likely to be valued at around six billion pounds making it Britain's third-largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance. As with recent demutualising building societies Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leceister, Norwich Union's members have seen the value of their stakes in the company steadily climb since proposals to float the group were first announced. Nearly three million Norwich policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares under the flotation plans. The company aims to raise another 1.75 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) of capital in a public and members' offer of new shares. Members have rushed to grab the opportunity to buy further shares at a 25 pence discount, queuing to beat the registration deadline earlier this week. Norwich Union said on Thursday it still expects the public offer to be priced at between 240 pence and 290 pence per share, 215 pence to 265 pence for members, suggesting large profits for those lucky enough to get extra shares. Bookmakers City Index are taking bets on a first day closing price of between 343 pence and 353 pence, a profit for members of at least 78 pence per share. Many are expected to cash in their profits immediately especially those who have borrowed to fund the purchase of extra shares. The minimum 300 free shares that 1.8 million with-profits members will receive is likely to be worth more than 1,000 pounds. The average handout will be far higher with additional shares based on the value and duration of their policies. The 1.1 million non-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares. Members may be disappointed by the number of discounted shares they actually receive with a scaling down of applications a near certainty. In fact, such has been members' appetite for extra shares that Norwich Union on Thursday announced it was clawing back 400 million pounds worth of shares from the public offering, primarily financial institutions, to satisfy demand. That took the members' share to around half of the total offering of 2.4 billion pounds. For Norwich Union, the flotation will bring to an end more than 200 years as a mutual where ownership is held jointly by members. Demutualisation will allow it to separate the group's life operations and thus policyholders' returns from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business. It will also strengthen Norwich Union's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom. Institutional demand is a big factor in the expected sharp rise in the share price. Both Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leceister saw their shares squeezed higher by financial institutions keen to buy and maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios. Like Halifax, Norwich is almost certain to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies later this year. Many analysts estimate fair value of the shares at anything from 280 pence to 340 pence. Norwich Union has also been touted as a possible takeover target, with Australian insurer AMP reportedly heading the list of possible predators. The probable price tag of the group now looks set to price it out reach of many who might have been interested.

"MCI Communications Corp's increased focus on high value customers has produced real results in the last quarter of 1996, positioning the company well for the impending market fight with regional Bells. ""Normally I take strategic position shifts with a pinch of salt, but you can really see it in this quarter's MCI numbers,"" said Richard Klugman of PaineWebber MCI, which reported results earlier on Tuesday, expanded long distance revenues by 10 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, ahead of volume growth of eight percent.   This reverses the normal position for long distance companies, which have tended to get less revenue for each average minute used on their system year by year. ""You are seeing a favorable gap (revenue growth minus volume growth),"" Klugman said. ""Part is the price increases around Thanksgiving, but part is the data services,"" he said. Data services are high value services, and are not billed on a minute basis. MCI said that it had increased average revenue per customer, cut the proportion of customers leaving for other carriers and built a more effective base for the future.   ""We are far more selective about customers going forward,"" MCI Chief Financial Offier Doug maine told Reuters. To push this process along MCI is aligning the pay of its sales people with the overall value rather than number of customers. The start of MCI One, a package of services on one bill, has helped that process, he said. ""They did what they said they would do and increased the focus in the long distance business on higher value customers,"" said Barry Sine, an analyst at SBC Warburg. Analysts are expecting a substantial increase in MCI's spending this year for marketing the expansion into local calling. MCI is sticking with its guidance to analysts to expect flat earnings per share for the year, they said. MCI is in the process of merging with British Telecommunications Plc. MCI stock was 1/4 firmer at 34-5/8 by midsession. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610)) ","NickLouth"
"Making use of technologies originally developed for supercomputers, Sun Microsystems Inc. will this week unveil its first high-end computer servers that can compete with mainframe performance. ""It's not just a hot box,"" said Ed Zander, president of the Sun Microsystems Computer Co. ""We look at this as combining the best of the mainframe world and the traditional Unix-server world."" The machines also are capable of more than four times the processing performance of an International Business Machines Corp.  mainframe, according to data supplied by Sun. The new Ultra Enterprise 10000 servers, which were code named Starfire, will be formally unveiled on Wednesday morning at a San Francisco news briefing and analysts expect them to further boost Sun's already roaring sales growth. The servers will be Sun's first machines priced in the $500,000 to $2 million range, offering stronger margin potential and extending the company's computer line to the heavy-duty machines used in corporate data centers. The Mountain View, Calif. company last week reported its second fiscal quarter revenues jumped 19 percent to a record $2.08 billion, and net income soared 41 percent to $178.3 million, helped by sales of server products. Goldman Sachs analyst Laura Conigliaro estimates that Sun's sales of servers -- machines which serve at the center of computer networks which are capable of intensive calculations -- grew in excess of 45 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. Sun also boosted its market share leadership in the fiercely competitive but weakening Unix workstation market in 1996, winning a 41 percent stake of the $15 billion market, a position larger than its next three rivals combined, according to a preliminary International Data Corp. survey. The base Starfire configuration -- with 16 processors and two gigabytes of memory -- will be priced starting at $873,890 and the machines will begin shipping in limited quantity this week, with volume shipments due around two months from now. Analysts and industry consultants said the computers will for the first time enable Sun to compete at the top end of the market with machines capable of handling the largest mission- critical tasks like online transaction processing. ""I think this is going to open up some new market segments for them,"" said a consultant at N.H.-based Technology Business Research. ""Sun's sales force has been unusually successful in selling in competitive environments."" Sun was able to take advantage of supercomputer-like performance features developed by Cray Business Systems. Rival Silicon Graphics Inc., which bought Cray Research last year, sold the former Cray division to Sun last May. The Cray team had already developed a machine based on Sun's Sparc/Solaris system that can run 64 processors. Sun is augmenting its new offering with powerful storage systems it says offers strong price-performance advantages. Among the features which distinguish the new computer systems are the ability to provide 10 times the amount of bandwidth of other Unix systems and 50 percent more than top- of-the-line mainframe computer models. The system can run at two to four times the power of an IBM mainframe as measured by million instructions per second, a standard measurement of computer speed, Sun said. ""This is deep into mainframe territory,"" said Andrew Allison, publisher of Inside the New Computer Industry. Zander said Starfire may not be a straight-out replacement for mainframe computers, but that customers may chose to shift major Unix applications to the Starfire technology, which can also be partitioned in the same way mainframes can. IDC analyst Jay Bretzmann projects the market for high-end Unix machines alone is around $2 billion now, and growing very rapidly in a total marketspace valued at around $50 billion. Sun said the Ultra Enterprise 10000 has set a record in an industry performance benchmark test known as the Transaction Performance Council Benchmark D. Analysts expect the machines to challenge rivals like Digital Equipment Corp., whose Alpha machines had topped the performance curves, and Hewlett-Packard Co., which was a pioneer in the high-end server market, and IBM. A number of organizations are in line for orders for the machine, including insurance giant Aetna Inc., the German maratime traffic agency BSH, health information services provider HCIA and the Kelly Services staffing agency. Rich Castor, technology officer at Aetna, said he chose the new Sun computers in competition with rival offerings because it brings mainframe-class capabilities to servers while using server-based applications packages. ""In this case, it allows us to marry mainframe class computing environments with some of the best of breed client- server applications programs,"" such as those of Oracle Corp. and Peoplesoft, he said. ""We're very impressed."" (sam.perry@reuters.com) ","SamuelPerry"
"China's President Jiang Zemin, speaking publicly for the first time since the death of Deng Xiaoping, vowed on Friday to push forward the reforms that his mentor launched 18 years ago. ""The Communist Party of China, the Chinese army and people of various ethnic groups are determined to turn grief into strength,"" Jiang told Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is on holiday in China. Speaking for the first time in public since Deng died, aged 92, on Wednesday, Deng's designated heir pledged to ""hold high the great banner of Deng's theory to build socialism with Chinese characteristics"". China would unite to pursue Deng's reforms and opening up ""unswervingly and confidently"", the Xinhua news agency quoted Jiang as saying. Jiang repeated almost word for word the official obituary of the pragmatic reformer whose belief that China's people should be allowed to get rich ended a decade of chaotic rule by Mao Zedong, who believed his people should be ""red"" -- communist. However, it was Jiang's first personal and public commitment that he planned to press on with Deng's capitalist-style reforms that have transformed China from a backward Stalinist state to an economic powerhouse. ""We would run China's undertakings still better, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, development and progress of the mankind,"" Jiang was quoted as saying. The death of Deng was ""an immeasurable loss"" to the Party, army and people of China, Jiang said. Jiang, who also holds the posts of Communist Party chief and head of the armed forces, emerged on Deng's death to rule China after seven years in waiting as his heir apparent. Diplomats say Jiang may soon find himself embroiled in a power struggle with other pretenders to power in the highest echelons of the ruling party. China's leadership has carefully displayed a united front. China-watchers say this may be a facade. ""It'll be like a duck swimming -- on the surface it'll be calm but underneath it'll be turbulent,"" said one Chinese analyst, quoting a Chinese proverb. In imperial China, the transfer of the ""mandate of heaven"" to a new emperor was rarely smooth. Deng only came to power in late 1978 after a two-year battle with Mao's appointed successor, Hua Guofeng. The latest power shift has so far been seamless, but analysts said later upheavals could not be ruled out. Jiang's first test will be at the crucial 15th Party Congress, which is expected to be held in October and is to elect a new central committee, politburo and party chief. The post of party chief, or general secretary, is the most powerful in China. At least one contest will be over a crusade by Premier Li Peng, 68, to try to retain his slot on the politburo standing committee -- the most powerful decision-making body in China. Li must step down as premier in 1998, after completing the maximum two terms, and is keen to make a play for the top party post so that he can remain in the hierarchy after he retires from the government job, analysts say.

"Imperial Chemcial Industries Plc said on Thursday that it would ""look at every creative opportunity"" for reshaping its business, including flotations, asset swaps, sales and acquisitions. In a telephone interview with Reuters following 1996 results and news of float plans for the Tioxide operations, group finance director Alan Spall said ""You can expect us to use every tool around to shift the portfolio."" Spall told Reuters that ICI would be ""a very different company"" by the turn of the century.   ""We are determined to reduce the proportion of assets and income from the heavy industrial end,"" Spall said, while building up the group's strength in less cyclical areas like ""polyurethanes, acrylics, performance chemicals and paints"". He said the ""whole of the industry"" is in talks on asset swaps and ""of course ICI is part of that"". The finance director pointed to Wednesday's $30 million acquisition of a Puerto Rico paint company and last year's purchase of Bunge Paints in South America as the kind of move that could be expected. ""There is a whole series of potential acquistions,"" said Spall.   The group's dermination to transform its operations was reinforced by the 1996 results, with sharp falls in price for industrial chemicals like tioxide, chlorine and polyester undermining progress at the lighter end, notably paints. ""Post demerger (the spin-off of Zeneca Group Plc in 1993) we have been growing our lighter end disproportionately and we have seen some cyclical price pressure on the industrial elements,"" he said. But he added: ""What goes down also goes up, and what is important to look at is the underlying robustness of the porfolio improvement.""   He predicted a ""sharp"" rise in Tioxide prices this year, and said that generally in industrial chemicals ""the fourth-quarter prices look like the bottom of what looks like a pause in the mid-1990s."" Prices of both olefins and chlorofins were now improving and ""1997 chemical production and demand looks better...the balance will tighten."" In Europe Spall said he detected two important trends, with ""volumes set to move upwards and destocking at an end in Germany.""   Spall said that since demerger output per employee had been growing by eight percent per year, but he added ""we recognise we are not as good as the best in the industry"". He said an efficiency drive to improve productivity and profit margins would be fully in place by the end of this year. The programme had added 165 million stg to pre-exepctional pre-tax profits of 603 million stg last year, the finance director added. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","JonathanBirt"
"Ivory Coast's power capacity is set to increase by one third but with domestic demand slim export customers will be needed, power engineering firms and distributors said on Wednesday. ""They have about 1,200 megawatts (MW) installed but there are no large industrial users,"" a West Africa-based manager for Swedish power group Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) told Reuters. ""One of the top 10 power consumers is a hotel."" The head of Ivory Coast's privatised power firm Compagnie d'Electricite Ivoirienne (CIE) agreed, and expected exports. ""The (domestic) problem is not so much one of construction. The techniques of construction are not a problem. It's the capacity to absorb the investment, to repay. There must be a market,"" CIE president Marcel Zadi Kessy said earlier this year. ABB and five other bidders submitted proposals in April to build a $300 million, 450 MW, gas-fired power plant near the capital Abidjan on build-own-transfer terms. The plant, at Azito, would start operating within 12 months with an initial capacity of 300 MW, which could be upgraded. The supplier will be chosen on the basis of competitive bids based on kilowatt/hour charge, with the winner is due to be declared in May. Plant ownership would pass to Ivory Coast after 20 years. ""Industrial companies would give us some baseload and make us less reliant on (an economy largely dependent on) cocoa and coffee prices,"" said ABB sub-regional manager Koen Beckers in a recent interview. Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is keen to diversify export earnings away from its rural economy. Power companies see promising markets in mining and food processing sectors, although domestic consumption is also set to rise, with a plan to supply 7,000 more villages over the next few years. In the 37 years since independence from France only about 1,000 villages have been connected. ""CIE (Compagnie d'Electricite Ivoirienne) has already invested quite a lot in improving grid quality,"" said Beckers. A nickel mine producing 30,000 tonnes a year is planned to open around the year 2002 at Biankouma in western Ivory Coast, which could raise industrial energy consumption by a further 150 MW, he said. About 24 companies, including many newcomers, are exploring mainly for gold in 55 permits, each of up to 1,000 square kilometres. Ivory Coast aims to triple cocoa bean processing capacity from about 150,000 tonnes to allow domestic processing of 50 percent of its long-term average yearly cocoa crop. Three factories are working and a further five are under discussion. Power exports began with Ghana after Ivory Coast achieved energy self-sufficiency in 1995. ""Now they (Ivorians) are discussing interconnecting Mali,"" meaning Ivory Coast would be connected to five other countries, said Beckers. Power deals now link Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Burkina Faso. Ivory Coast also exports natural gas after using 60 percent of offshore output to feed its own thermal power stations, recently converted from other fuels. Ivorian mines and energy Minister Lamine Fadika in April urged Ghana to fuel a new 300 MW power station at Takoradi, due on line this year with new Ivorian offshore gas under development by Shell and UMIC, a unit of Houston-based United Meridian Corp. Ivory Coast's six hydroelectric plants can produce 604 MW and the Vridi thermal plant near Abidjan can produce 300 MW-plus. Another 210 MW came on stream in April from CIPREL plant, a joint-venture between French firms Bouygues and Electricite de France. A planned Regional West African Energy Community would ""allow countries with excess... gas or electricity, to fulfill the needs of neighbouring countries,"" said Fadika at a March conference in Accra on ""Meeting Africa's Oil and Gas Needs"". -- Abidjan newsroom, + 225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"As Canada's budget deficit shrinks, politicians campaigning ahead of June elections are debating whether to cut taxes or raise government spending. While many Canadians say they are desperate for tax relief, others are begging politicians to shun tax cuts and spend the extra money on social services. ""They have to stop talking about cutting taxes,"" one Toronto social worker said as Reform party leader and tax cut advocate Preston Manning spoke nearby at the kickoff of his campaign for the June 2 election. ""People want to hear about jobs and job creation. If you have a job you worry about keeping it, you worry about losing it,"" she told the Canadian Press news agency. Canada's unemployment rate is a stubbornly high 9.3 percent. The governing Liberals on Sunday called for the June vote, just 3-1/2 years into their five-year term. The two right-wing parties, Reform and the Conservatives, are touting their plans to cut taxes. Canada has the highest personal income taxes among the seven leading industrial nations and the fourth highest among the member nations of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, according to an OECD study. ""(Conservative leader) Jean Charest believes that high taxes kill jobs -- that the economy needs tax cuts now to create jobs,"" the Conservatives' campaign literature says. Reform lashed out at Liberal tax increases, accusing the centrist party of pushing through 31 tax hikes while in office. Reform has promised to cut payroll taxes and contributions to unemployment insurance, as well as simplify the income tax system. In 1996, the average Canadian family's tax bill was about 48 percent of its income, a study released on Tuesday showed. But the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) opposes tax cuts, saying right-wing platforms are irresponsible. The NDP actually wants to raise corporate and capital gains taxes. The separatist Bloc Quebecois wants Ottawa to close tax loopholes for big business, while giving tax breaks to smaller firms to stimulate growth. The Liberals are sandwiched between the right's call for tax cuts and the left's call for spending, and face different opinions in their own ranks on the issue. They have taken a typical middle-of-the-road approach, advocating tax cuts once the deficit is licked and when health care and education are securely funded. ""The choice the other political parties are offering is to declare the job done before it truly is, to introduce a tax cut before the country can afford it,"" Finance Minister Paul Martin told a Montreal news conference on Tuesday. ""They would short-change our hopes for a stronger economy and for greater job creation."" Martin said his party would lower taxes but only when the deficit was eliminated. Instead, his party announced on Monday they would not cut C$6 billion (US$4.3 billion) in health care funding, as had been planned. Martin has predicted the deficit for the year ended March 31, 1997, would be less than C$16 billion ($11.4 billion), well below the original target of C$24.3 billion ($17.4 billion) for the year. But the Conservatives argue that 87 percent of the deficit decline was due to higher taxes. They say real after-tax income has fallen from the early 1990s. ","HeatherScoffield"
"Hundreds of mining prospectors, armed with axes and machetes, are racing through swamps and thick brush in remote Northern Ontario this week in one of the largest staking rushes in decades. The Ontario government invited prospectors to explore a 617,500-hectare area in the Temagami region, making the land available for the first time in 23 years. But there was a shortage of experienced prospectors in the area, so big companies trained local high school track teams to fill in. ""There's a lot of potential,"" provincial government geologist Elaine Basa said. ""It's an area that hasn't been open to new technology. It's like virgin territory and that's what's exciting to a lot of people."" Up to 600 prospectors, many of them hired by international mining companies, have been clambering across the rugged Canadian Shield, hoping to find gold or base metals. The parcel of land is not far from existing gold mines and old copper and base metal mines, Basa said. ""That's why it's such a big target,"" she said. ""A lot of people want a piece of the pie."" The Ontario government closed off the area in 1973 after a local Indian band laid claim to the land. The claim was struck down in 1991 and the government eventually decided to open the area to logging and exploration again -- despite raucous protests from environmentalists. Major international mining companies, small explorers and independent prospectors have flocked to the rocky Canadian Shield. Most spent the weekend camping in the bush, preparing for what many saw as the chance of a lifetime. Prospectors must follow strict rules to stake their claims. ""You physically have to define the boundaries out in the field,"" said Roy Denomme, a government mining recorder. The race started Tuesday morning, with prospectors sprinting through the thick bush to pound a huge stake in each corner of the property. Between each stake, they had to blaze a boundary by marking trees with their axes along the way. Some prospectors spent the weekend hiding stakes in the thick forest near the claim corners, hoping to get an edge on their competitors, said Basa. The first person to stake all four corners and file a claim wins the rights to the property. Prospectors have 31 days to file their claims. Basa expects a lot of wheeling and dealing in the next few days as the powerful mining companies manoeuvre for the best properties. Toronto-based Falconbridge Ltd. sent a team of prospectors to the area in helicopters. ""It's a real crap shoot,"" said Paul Severin, vice president of exploration for Falconbridge, whose huge copper-zinc Kidd Creek mine is in nearby Timmins, Ontario. ","HeatherScoffield"

"Police sealed off South Korea's embassy and consular office in China's capital Beijing on Thursday after one of North Korea's top officials was reported to have sought asylum from Seoul. Dozens of police were posted along the quiet, tree-lined streets around the South Korean embassy's consular section in the diplomatic district of Beijing and had sealed roads leading into the area. ""No one is allowed to come through here,"" one policeman told a Chinese trying to reach the consular section, housed in a two-storey building in a garden compound, to apply for a visa. Police declined to say whether the area had been sealed off after Seoul announced on Wednesday that Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to the North's leader Kim Jong-il, had sought asylum at its embassy in Beijing, along with his assistant Kim Dok-hong. At the main South Korean embassy in a glass and concrete office block in central Beijing, Chinese police prevented anyone approaching the fourth floor office. ""This is Chinese territory, you are not on embassy ground so you have to leave,"" one Chinese police officer said. South Korean embassy officials were unavailable to comment, and secretarial staff said they were all in meetings. China's Foreign Ministry said it had no immediate statement on the situation. An official at the North Korean embassy in Beijing repeated allegations by Pyongyang that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of the Workers' Party, must have been kidnapped. The official refused to comment further, saying the statement by North Korea's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday that Hwang's defection was ""inconceivable and impossible"" was correct. ""If it is true that Hwang Jang-yop is in the South Korean 'embassy' in Beijing, it is obvious that he has been kidnapped by the enemy. We are seeking information from the Chinese side through relevant channels,"" the Korean Central News Agency quoted the Pyongyang Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. ""If it is brought to light that the South Korean authorities kidnapped him and describe him as seeking ""asylum,"" we will regard it as a serious incident without precedent and take due countermeasures,"" he said. ""We expect that the Chinese side will take appropriate measures in this regard,"" the spokesman added. A South Korean unification ministry spokesman in Seoul said on Thursday the North's claim was ""preposterous"". He said South Korea aimed to step up diplomatic efforts to grant Hwang's wish to seek asylum. Hwang, 73, is one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, and would be the highest ranking Pyongyang official ever to seek asylum in the South. He is credited with playing a leading role in shaping the policy of Juche, a brand of fanatic self-reliance providing the ideological underpinning for the world's last Stalinist state. South and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict. ","ScottHillis"
"The French government said on Tuesday it planned to sell the loss-making SFP film studios, maker of much of the country's cinema and television film heritage, to Generale des Eaux and Havas. The sale, which still needs approval from the independent Privatisation Commission, will be preceded by a state capital injection of up to 1.2 billion francs ($229 million). The Societe Francaise de Production et de Creation Audiovisuelle (SFP) will get 350 million francs of this amount before the end of 1996. In a joint statement, the Culture Ministry and the Ministry of Economy and Finance said Culture Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy had met European Commissioner Karel van Miert in Brussels on Monday to discuss the planned capital injection. ""He (Van Miert) accepted the principle of a very quick opening of the examination procedure which would allow the European Commission to approve, in principle before the spring, the state's financial effort in the privatisation framework."" It said that the cash injection was needed because of the financial and economic situation of the SFP and would allow the future shareholders to run the normal operating risks and contribute 40 percent to the costs of a job reduction plan. There had been four offers for SFP on the table. One was by Global Studios run by French businessman Walter Butler, another by Little Big One (LBO) run by Swiss investor Frabrice Giger and a third by former SFP director Jean Cressant. The fourth was made by Havas' Images Television International and Generale des Eaux's Generale des Images. All the bids were demanding a state capital injection in exchange for maintaining jobs. The Havas/Generale des Eaux plan contained 480 job cuts out of the 1,010 SFP staff. LBO promised to keep as many as 700 jobs while Walter Butler would have kept 580. Generale des Eaux, which also owns the Babelsberg studios in Germany, had previously backed the Butler bid. The European Commission had previously objected to the 1.1 billion franc in aid given to SFP between 1993 and 1996. The SFP studios were created on the grounds of the Buttes Chaumont villa of French film pioneer Leon Gaumont in north Paris and its later facilities in Boulogne-Billancourt and modern site at Bry-sur-Marne are the backdrop of many French films and television series. The group ran into difficulties adjusting to competition by smaller independent production companies and by changed buying behaviour by the French television companies following the arrival of competitors TF1, owned by Bouygues, M6 and Canal Plus. Last year SFP signed a deal to sell its Buttes Chaumont studios to Bouygues and demolished the buildings to make place for an office and housing complex. But a change in the political scene in Paris held up the procedure for the building licence. Banks Paribas and Credit National had granted SFP a 250 million franc loan with as collateral the future receipts of the sale. These banks wanted SFP to pay the final 200 million of the loan back before the end of the year. Where the studios once stood, there is now a large hole in the ground.

"Cable and Wireless Plc, Britain's second biggest telecommunications company, reported record annual profits on Wednesday but said it was biding its time before choosing any global partners. C&amp;W, which confirmed it was still in talks with telecoms alliances such as Global One, said pre-tax profits after exceptional items jumped 12 percent to 1.42 billion pounds ($2.3 billion). The company, which raised its total dividend 11 percent to 11.1 pence for the year to March 31, said improved demand in its businesses around the world and increased productivity had boosted performance. Group turnover, including C&amp;W's share of associated undertakings, rose 13 percent to just over 7.0 billion pounds. Underlying profits were in line with expectations and the shares eased 6.6p to 506p at 1140 GMT. ""The results were pretty much in line with expectations after stripping out about 180 million pounds of one-offs. We won't be changing our forecasts,"" ABN AMRO Hoare Govett analyst James Ross said. But C&amp;W's chief executive Richard Brown said in the results statement that the company was just beginning to build long-term growth: ""We are seizing opportunities to expand our revenues in fresh, innovative ways."" The company last month merged its British telephone subsidiary Mercury with three cable television companies to create the country's biggest cable group called Cable and Wireless Communications, which some analysts say will enhance the bottom line within a couple of years. Finance director Robert Lerwill told Reuters in an interview that the group continued to talk with suitors such as the Global One alliance of Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint Corp. But he noted: ""There's nothing specific on any conversations with Global One worth commenting on. ""People have been approaching us and are interested in us -- which demonstrates our global reach and the appeal we have for many of these global alliances."" Global One is keen to gain access to the British market as well as C&amp;W's key Asian business interests including its ace card -- a near-60 percent stake in lucrative Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. Hong Kong Telecom contributed just over 1.0 billion pounds to annual operating profits and 2.67 billion pounds to group turnover. A partnership with Global One would also allow C&amp;W to tap the key European telecoms markets, such as France and Germany, which are heading for liberalisation next year. Despite owning a small subsidiary called Cable and Wireless Europe, C&amp;W has limited access to continental Europe. ""If we did in some way get associated with another alliance, then (continental) Europe is the place where there is more to go for,"" Lerwill said. C&amp;W says it will use Cable and Wireless Communications as its springboard for European expansion. One question mark which hangs over C&amp;W is its holding in Hong Kong Telecom. With only weeks to go before the British colony reverts to Chinese control, speculation has been sparked that China may pressure C&amp;W into reducing its majority stake. But C&amp;W insists there is no requirement for it do so. It welcomed more direct Chinese involvement in Hong Kong Telecom last week, seeing it as a sign the Chinese are likely to use the company as their principal telecoms partner in Hong Kong. China Everbright, which reports to China's State Council, bought a 7.7 percent stake in the Hong Kong company from CITIC Pacific, which is seen by analysts to be more independent. Some analysts expect further Chinese investment in Hong Kong Telecom, combined with new growth opportunities for the Hong Kong firm on the Chinese mainland. But Adrian Goodall, telecoms analyst at SBC Warburg, said: ""The potential for growth in China is indisputable, although the ability to make attractive returns from investment in that growth may be a tough proposition.""

"Microsoft Corp.'s fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 85 percent to $1.04 billion, well beyond analysts' expectations, on strength in its core business, including sales of its Office 97 upgrade, the world's largest software company reported Thursday. Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated that he expects results in the current fourth quarter to be similar to the quarter ended March 31, which he termed ""sizzling."" But in an interview Brown also said he expects Microsoft's growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons with year-earlier quarters and a lack of planned major new upgrades. Net income, equal to 79 cents a share, rose from earnings of $562 million a year ago, or 44 cents a share, in the third quarter. The number easily topped Wall Street's consensus analyst forecast of 64 cents a share, according to First Call. Revenues totalled $3.21 billion, a 45 percent increase over the $2.21 billion racked up in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average had predicted revenues of about $2.9 billion. Microsoft released its latest results after financial markets closed. In after-hours trading, the Redmond, Wash.-based company's stock jumped $4.625 to $102.75 from its Nasdaq closing price, dealers said. ""Worldwide acceptance of Microsoft Office 97 ignited these outstanding results,"" Brown said in a statement. Office 97, the latest upgrade of the company's best-selling software package, was launched in January. It combines ""productivity applications"" such as word processing and spreadsheets that accounted for an estimated $2 billion of the company's $8.7 billion in the prior fiscal year. Brown said Microsoft also realised ""solid gains"" from sales of operating systems. Microsoft makes the bulk of its money from ""platforms,"" including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers, which generate about one-third of the company's revenues. ""However,"" Brown cautioned, ""incredible results like these are seldom duplicated, and we are mindful of the very tough comparisons we will have in fiscal 1998."" Brown said in the interview that the first quarter of fiscal 1998 could show a downturn from the fourth fiscal quarter of 1997. He said he expected results to rise sequentially after that. Brown said he expected a spike in revenues from the Office 97 upgrade would begin to tail off in the current quarter, although deferred revenues from product shipped earlier would prevent a sequential downturn. The next upgrade of Office will not be out until fiscal 1999, Brown said. ""So, fiscal '98 is in the product cycle valley from a comparison standpoint, and that makes the comparison tough, even if business fundamentals are very good,"" he said. Brown said he expected the revenue surge from the Windows 95 operating system to begin to tail off soon now that the product has been out 20 months. Brown said he was ""very excited"" about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an ""all-time Olympic record."" ""We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS (earnings pr share) went up 80 percent,"" he said. ""That's not a quarter-in, quarter-out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter.""

"The rapidly evolving market for stored-value cards could be hurt by premature government regulation, one of the top U.S. bank regulators said in a report issued Wednesday. An array of companies, including banks, credit card networks and others, are trying to popularize stored value or ""smart"" cards that carry electronic currency. But the cards have yet to catch on with consumers. Federal Reserve Board, which regulates banks and runs the payment system used to tranfer hundreds of billions of dollars a day among financial institutions, evaluated possible regulation of smart cards under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. ""Early regulation of electronic stored-value products could cause higher regulatory costs than later regulation,"" the Fed said in its report. Regulations could be costly for smart card providers and might arbitrarily favor one type of product over another, the Fed said. ""Given the limited experience with stored value products to date, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the benefits to consumers from any particular Regulation E provision would outweigh the corresponding costs of compliance,"" the report noted. Regulation E sets out the Fed's rules for electronic funds transfers, including protecting consumers against fraudulent or mistaken transfers. Sen Bob Bennett, chairman of the Senate banking Committee's subcommittee on financial services and technology who criticized an initial Fed plan to regulate smart cards, welcomed the report. ""For the first time, the Federal Reserve has carefully considered the cost of action as well as the potential cost of inaction with regard to the implementation of new regulations on the fledgling stored-value card industry,"" the Utah Republican said. Last April, the Fed had proposed applying some parts of the funds transfer act to smart cards. But Bennett and others in Congress opposed that move and passed legislation requiring a report before any action was taken. Early regulation could have some benefits, however, the Fed said. Government rules have ""the potential to speed up development by promoting standardization and by removing uncertainty."" In any event, the market will probably grow slowly, the Fed predicted. ""Widespread public acceptance of stored-value products, if it occurs at all, will likely develop slowly over many years,"" the report said. ""Their introduction seems unlikely to change the fundamental nature of our current payment system in the near future."" David Jung, senior analyst at the market research firm Killen &amp; Associates, agreed. ""We expect solid growth of about 25 percent a year but we don't see any break-out yet,"" Jung said. Volume of smart card transaction is expected to grow from under one billion transactions this year to about 10 billion worldwide in 2001, Jung said. Fairly soon, smart cards could be used to pay for everything from parking meters to magazines published on the Internet, Jung said. ((202-898-8312)) ","AaronPressman"
"Pop singer Michael Jackson came to Prague on Tuesday to launch his first tour in two years as promoters erected a huge statue of the star on a hill over the city where a monument to Soviet boss Josef Stalin once stood. Jackson's three-month ""HIStory"" tour through Europe, Africa and Asia kicks off on Saturday with a concert on Prague's Letna Plain where 130,000 are expected, but he arrived four days early to do some sightseeing in and around the Czech capital. After his jet sat for half an hour on the tarmac of Prague airport's VIP terminal, the flamboyant but reclusive Jackson emerged in a gold lame and red outfit under a white parasol blocking the bright sun. Several hundred fans handpicked by promoters greeted the star, and he hugged several fans who presented gifts on the tarmac before Jackson's motorcade left. After waving at others lining the 15 km (10 mile) route into the city from a gleaming Rolls Royce, Jackson and his police-escorted phalynx of luxury cars carrying his entourage drove through a screaming hotel welcoming party. Thousands of fans amassed at the hotel on the river Vltava (Moldau), climbing over each other for a glimpse of the star on his first tour since he was cleared of child molestation charges by a U.S. court because of lack of evidence. Pavel Klika, in his late teens from the southern Czech city of Tabor, played a human ""K"" in a seven-member group spelling out J-A-C-K-S-O-N for his arrival. ""I had to come here to see him to really beleive he was in the Czech Republic, even though I have a ticket to see him on Saturday -- I just couldn't wait,"" Klika said. The singer's penthouse suite Prague faces the hill where a 10-metre (33 foot) water-filled statue of Jackson takes up the rock pedastal where Communists built a massive monument to Stalin which they later blew up up after his death in 1953. Despite complaints about the Jackson statue in some quarters, Prague City Hall finally approved its placement until the concert is completed on Saturday. Two huge torches on either side of Jackson's statue were lit recalling the days when Stalin's Cult of Personality kept two Olympic-style flames burning. The Prague stop, Jackson's first visit to the Czech capital in a long series of rock concerts since the fall of Communism here in 1989, has so far avoided the controversy at other planned dates on his tour. In South Korea, civic and religious groups reacted bitterly to a decision to let Jackson play two concerts in Seoul in October, saying it was unbelievable that the government agreed to to make an ""amoral singer"" the teenagers' idol. A planned stop in Casablanca was cancelled by Moroccan authorities, without explanation. A concert organiser said the government did not want 100,000 youths all in the same place. ","JohnMastrini"
"Industry and crop analysts are sticking to forecasts of a total Ivorian 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) cocoa crop of well over one million tonnes though the government appears to say it will be less than that figure. ""We raised our forecast to 1.07 million tonnes in January from one million tonnes but really there could be 1.1 million tonnes,"" said one major buyer of Ivorian cocoa. Ivorian Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan restated on Wednesday in Paris that Ivory Coast's total 1996/97 crop would be less than one million tonnes -- in line with an earlier Ivorian Caistab marketing board estimate of 950,000 tonnes. It was not immediately clear whether Kouassi was referring to total arrivals of cocoa at ports, or beans considered to be of sufficient quality for export. ""That would certainly not be the total arrivals figure but it could be the export figure,"" said one port source. ""Arrivals (of cocoa declared at ports) are already close to 900,000 tonnes (since October 1) so we are really looking at a crop of not much less than last year,"" said another source. Sources close to the agriculture ministry said arrivals figures to February 21 (since October 24) stood at around 850,000 tonnes. Quality inspectors have pointed to generally good bean quality depite humidity problems. The 1996/97 cocoa season opened on October 24, about three weeks later than usual. Exporters have said 30,000-50,000 tonnes should be added to arrivals figures to give a cumulative arrival figure since October 1. Crop analysts expect Ivory Coast's main crop (Oct-Sept) alone to match to the Caistab's 950,000 tonnes full-year forecast, but they said predictions of a promising mid-crop (April-Sept) were still premature. Ivory Coast is estimated to have produced a record 1.2 million tonnes in 1995/96 after a larger than expected 200,000 tonnes mid-crop. Prospects for this year's mid-crop depend partly on rains over the next few weeks. Industry sources do not expect rejection of cocoa at port to reduce total exports significantly. Industry sources said undisclosed amounts of sub-standard cocoa had been declared at ports but rejected as Fair Average Quality (FAQ) -- or unexportable sub-grade. That would be either mixed in with better quality cocoa and exported, or bought by local factories. Rejection of cocoa could cut into total crop figures but industry sources say little is likely to go to waste. ""Most is presented again for export. Little goes to waste so it will be sold somehow,"" said one exporter, referring to humidity problems in early 1997. One set of figures circulating put arrivals to February 21 at 936,000 tonnes, with close to 150,000 tonnes initially classified as sub-grade, industry sources said. Ivory Coast has said in the past it would process its lower quality mid-crop cocoa locally to remove lower grades from world markets and add more value to exports. ""Local factories will probably use about 160,000 tonnes this year so a certain proportion will be set aside for that,"" one source said. Factory capacity currently stands at around 180,000 tonnes although plans for more factories are reaching final stages. Foreign buyers recently voiced concern that poorer grades were being mixed in with export quality cocoa rather than being absorbed by local factories. ""The normal crop potential for Ivory Coast is around 1.17 million tonnes,"" said one port source. ""Take off 160,000 tonnes and you are not far off the one million figure,"" he added. ""The question is how much will be held back for next year to speculate on prices. That depends on how much money traders have to hand,"" he said. -- Abidjan newsroom +225 21 90 90 ","MatthewBunce"
"China's jailing of leading dissident Wang Dan is clear evidence of the kind of abuse that this week led a U.S. report to condemn Beijing for its rights record, the former student leader's father said on Friday. All nations had the right and responsibility to concern themselves with human rights in other countries, said Wang Xianzeng, whose son was last year sentenced to 11 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government. ""In Wang Dan's case, I know... the human rights situation is very bad,"" Wang Xiangzeng told Reuters by telephone. ""If (the United States) is seeking the truth in its concern with the Chinese human rights situation, then that is as it ought to be,"" he said. In an annual human rights report on 193 countries released on Thursday, the United States accused China of effectively silencing public dissent against the government by detaining, jailing or driving into exile all known dissidents. This year's hard-hitting report was released amid a dramatic improvement in Sino-U.S. ties that have long been rocked by disputes over issues ranging from rights to trade to Taiwan. Analysts say Beijing, which stayed silent on the U.S. report on Friday and has recently reacted with uncharacteristic mildness to U.S. concerns over human rights and Hong Kong, is eager to keep up the positive momentum in cross-Pacific ties. The recent Sino-U.S. rapprochement last October survived Wang Dan's jailing after a four-hour trial that was denounced by human rights activists as a politically-orchestrated sham. Wang Xianzeng said his son, a former leader of 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the army, had done nothing to justify the harsh sentence meted out by judges of the Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court. ""Nothing Wang Dan did...offended against the laws of China, as his parents we cannot agree with such a heavy sentence and we cannot accept the verdict,"" Wang Xianzeng said. He said both he and Wang Dan's mother, 61-year-old museum researcher Wang Lingyun, planned to visit their son next month at his prison in Jinzhou city in China's Liaoning province. Wang, who served four years in jail for his role in the 1989 protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, was still suffering from numerous medical complaints that could not be treated at his draughty jail in China's frigid northeast, his father said. ""(Wang Dan) suffers many illnesses...they can't cope with serious complaints although they can deal with small problems or colds,"" he said. Wang Dan was one of China's most articulate political dissenters between his parole from the 1989 sentence until he vanished into detention in May 1995. His jailing and the later dismissal of his appeal were part of a series of hammer blows last year that all but silenced China's tiny band of pro-democracy activists. U.S. officials have said human rights remain an important influence on Sino-U.S. relations, but have made clear that no one issue will be allowed to derail warming ties with Beijing. China was not the only target of the U.S. State Department report, which also found problems with the rights records of allies Turkey, South Korea and Germany as well as Russia, Indonesia, Haiti and Nigeria. Wang Xianzeng said it was only right for the international community to take an interest in the human rights records of different nations -- adding such interest could be mutual. ""China can also concern itself with human rights in the United States, can it not?"" he said. ","MureDickie"
"Convicts leading a riot, in which at least five guards died, demanded on Friday to be flown out of a jail in northern Colombia by helicopter to an undisclosed location, the regional human rights ombudsman said. The inmates, some convicted leftist guerrillas and others former police officers, requested 10 parachutes, while one man, a jailed leader of the now defunct M-19 rebel group, demanded political exile in Cuba, ombudsman Carmen Quintero said. About 550 prisoners seized control of the jail compound in Valledupar, in Cesar province, after taking weapons from prison guards on Thursday evening. A National Prison Institute (INPEC) spokeswoman said the prisoners had taken 16 hostages, including the jail's deputy director and a 14-year-old girl. ""The prisoners are demanding vehicles to leave the jail and two helicopters with 10 parachutes. They have not said where they want to fly to but said they would take the hostages with them as a guarantee,"" Quintero told reporters outside the jail. Provincial governor Mauricio Pimiento, part of the delegation trying to mediate the crisis, said he would not discuss the inmates' demands until they had freed their hostages and allowed all the dead and injured to be removed from the compound. ""A prisoner has reported that five guards are dead...,"" a spokeswoman for the prison said. The inmates allowed an ambulance into the prison for some of the five inmates and jail guards injured in the initial shootout. Police and soldiers surrounded the prison and fired bullets and tear gas over the walls but were ordered not to enter for fear of inflaming the situation, the spokeswoman said. ""We are holding our fire and have merely formed three security cordons around the jail,"" a police spokesman later told Reuters by phone from Valledupar. Col. Rafael Pardo, head of national prisons, said there was no independent confirmation of the number of dead and injured because inmates had barred the security forces from entering the jail. In addition to the small group of prisoners looking to break out of the jail, other inmates are demanding an end to prison overcrowding and improved living conditions. The Valledupar prison is designed to house 200 convicts but more than 550 are imprisoned there. Earlier this week, Justice Minister Carlos Medellin admitted chronic overcrowding had turned Colombia's jails into a ""seedbed for corruption and violence."" Across Colombia, 40,000 inmates are housed in facilities designed for 30,000 prisoners. If news of the deaths was confirmed, it would be the worst in a string of prison disturbances this year. Last week, more than 2,000 inmates, led by leftist guerrillas, rioted and started fires in Bogota's La Modelo jail in protest at prison overcrowding. Another convict died in the top-security wing of Bogota's La Picota jail when a bomb he was making in his cell exploded. Prisoners have rioted in at least three provincial jails so far this year.

""That $0.23, I'm comfortable with that,"" Jones told Reuters. ""Which puts it at $0.79 for the year."" St. Louis-based Jones earned $0.16 per share, as restated for a three-million-share pooling acquisition of privately held Daniels Pharmaceuticals, in the fourth quarter a year ago and $0.50 per share in all of 1995, Jones said.   Shares in Jones were down 1-1/4 to 31-3/4 on heavy trading, extending a bumpy week for the drug company. ""It's huge volume, unbelievable,"" Jones said. ""I guess they're trying to find out what the valuation should be."" Throughout last year, Jones' stock price was extremely volatile, starting 1996 near 10, climbing through the summer to 50 by September, then sliding in the past four months. Earlier, institutional holding of the stock had grown to over 50 percent from 15 percent of total outstanding shares, Jones said. ""Of those, a lot of them were momentum players, and it looks like they've lightened up,"" he said.   The company expects to report year-end financial results in the second week of February, Jones said. Jones has made four acquisitions since August, 1995.

"The French government on Wednesday halted the sale of electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe but said it still wanted to privatise the group to build a large French defence company. French defence firms including Thomson's 58-percent owned Thomson-CSF, Matra, combat plane maker Dassault Aviation, tank builder GIAT, and aerospace group Aerospatiale face shrinking defence budgets and a restructuring of the industry in Europe. President Jacques Chirac when he announced in February that he wanted Aerospatiale to merge with Dassault Aviation -- maker of the Mirage and Rafale planes -- and the privatisation of Thomson made it clear he wanted strong French groups to play a powerful role in Europe, rather than see smaller French companies swallowed up by large European rivals. Most of Germany's defence activities are in the hands of Daimler-Benz AG while Britain has two big defence champions in British Aerospace Plc and General Electric Co Plc. Thomson-CSF is a big player in its defence electronics niches but is small compared with the British and German groups. The government on October 16 decided it preferred the offer of Lagardere for the Thomson group over one from Alcatel Alsthom because of defence issues. Lagardere wanted to merge Thomson-CSF with its Matra Defence Espace unit, making a large group with international ties. Alcatel wanted to merge Thomson-CSF with its much smaller defence electronics activities and then planned to hoist Thomson-CSF to the number two spot in the world defence industry, overtaking GM Hughes Electronics Corp but staying behind Lockeed Martin, through an alliance with another big group -- either GEC or Daimler-Benz or both. But the government was not taken with Alcatel's effort to create a conglomerate active in many kinds of electronics, from televisions in Thomson Multimedia to telecommunications and Thomson-CSF's defence activities, but preferred the pure defence play of Lagardere. Industry sources said the government feared that French interests would not be able to retain control in a large alliance under the Alcatel banner. There was even a newspaper report, never confirmed, that President Jacques Chirac's decision to go with Jean-Luc Lagardere was influenced by a report that General Electric Co Plc honorary chairman Lord Weinstock and executive chairman George Simpson had discussed how they could take the upper hand in such an alliance. Although Chirac brought French forces back into the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), he is very keen on safeguarding France's own defence capabilities, as shown by his decision to finalise a series of nuclear tests. An independent self-sufficent defence force needs to have unhindered access to arms supplies. At first, industry observers believed Alcatel was only interested in the multimedia business and financial analysts were slightly surprised when Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk unveiled big defence plans. Lagardere has never hidden his intention to keep only Thomson-CSF and went to great lengths to make its South Korean partner Daewoo Electronics acceptable to the French government. The government did come around to accept Daewoo but on Monday France's highest authority on the sale of state assets -- the independent seven-member Privatisation Commission -- told the government that it could not approve certain elements of the planned sale, for one franc, of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo.

"Hong Kong regulators said on Thursday they are closely watching a dispute between Taiwan and Hong Kong over two Hong Kong-listed call warrants linked to the Taipei index. ""This is something we're keeping an eye on,"" Bill Weeks, spokesman for Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), told Reuters. Taiwan is threatening legal action after the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on Wednesday listed the two call warrants linked to the Taiwan weighted index, one issued by Peregrine Derivatives Ltd  and the other by Union Bank of Switzerland. Weeks said the SFC approved the concept of listing derivative warrants in Hong Kong, but the precise form of the warrants was left up to the Hong Kong exchange. The Taiwan Stock Exchange on Wednesday said the Taiwan weighted index was its proprietary product and that it had ""serious concern and objection"" to the new products. Sources said that rather than a regulatory issue, the current dispute appears to be more a legal matter involving copyright and trademark. ""Because these companies have not been authorised by the Taiwan Stock Exchange to use its index, the exchange has issued an urgent letter to the two firms to express serious concern and objection and reserves the rights for necessary legal actions,"" the Taiwan exchange said in a statement on Wednesday, shortly after the products were launched. The Hong Kong stock exchange hit back by pointing out that similar products were listed and traded in Luxembourg. These call warrants would improve Hong Kong's status as a trading centre for regional products and boost market liquidity, the Hong Kong exchange said. ""The exchange believes that the listing of the products will improve the liquidity of the underlying cash market and is in the best interest of all markets,"" the Hong Kong statement said. The Hong Kong exchange is charging ahead with plans to list more regional derivative products. It has not imposed a transaction tax on any regional derivative warrants or convertible bonds. Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Alec Tsui said on Wednesday the exchange was publishing a monthly report on the latest developments supporting the listing and trading of convertible bonds or derivative warrants on underlying securities listed on 15 regional exchanges. They are Tokyo, Osaka, Korea, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Jakarta, Australia, New Zealand, Bombay and the National Stock Exchange of India, Tsui said. -- Hong Kong News Room (852) 2843 6470 ","SarahDavison"
"Bre-X Minerals Ltd. chief geologist Michael de Guzman, who co-discovered the richest gold find this century, may have committed suicide when he fell out of a helicopter on Wednesday, a company spokesman said on Thursday. Rescue crews were still searching the dense Borneo rain forest for de Guzman's body after he plunged 800 feet from a helicopter en route to the Busang site in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province. Bre-X spokesman Steve McAnulty said company officials obtained a copy of an apparent suicide note found by Indonesian police among de Guzman's belongings. ""Mike did leave a note. Basically the upshot of it is Mike had just learned that he had hepatitis B. The prognosis was not good due to the fact that he had suffered many bouts of malaria which had weakened his system over the years,"" McAnulty said in a telephone interview. ""We understand the prognosis was not good for recovery and apparently there was a lot of pain involved and he decided he did not want to go through that,"" McAnulty said. He added that foul play was not suspected and Indonesian police were treating his death as suicide. The 40-year-old Filipino geologist was a key member of the team that discovered Busang a few years ago. Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X has agreed to develop the Busang site, valued at $25 billion, with U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. and Indonesian partners. De Guzman, a 20-year mining industry veteran, was also credited with co-discovering the large Dizon copper-gold deposit in the Phillipines. John Felderhof, Bre-X's senior vice-president of exploration, was traveling to Indonesia to replace de Guzman at scheduled meetings with Freeport-McMoRan. The incident was the latest tragedy involving Canadian mining companies in far-flung corners of the world. In October 1995, nine employees of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco Corp. were killed in a helicopter crash in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyzstan Air helicopter, chartered by a Cameco unit, was en route from the Kumtor gold mine when it went down. The families of the nine Canadians killed in the crash have filed a C$20.7 million ($15.1 million) lawsuit alleging Cameco and other defendants were negligent. In September 1996, Falconbridge Ltd. Chief Executive Franklin Pickard died of a heart attack when visiting the Toronto-based company's copper site high in Chile's Andes Mountains.

"Profit-taking and changing market sentiment pulled the Czech crown lower on Thursday, and dealers said they expected a further weakening of the currency since there were few fundamentals to support it. Once one of Europe's most stable currencies, confidence in the crown has been shaken badly in the past two weeks as the market became nervous following central bank comments that it was overvalued and that interest rate cuts may be in the air. In late afternoon trading, the crown was at 28.873 against the dollar and 17.090 to the mark, implying +2.74 against basket midpoint after opening at +3.53 percent. Dealers said it had been pushed lower as thoughts turned to actions and investors ran to take profits while they could. ""The fall is part profit-taking, and part change in market sentiment,"" said Breta Tichanek of ING Bank in Prague. ""We are really seeing an outflow of investment from the crown at this moment, but I don't think it will last for more than a couple of weeks,"" he added. At midday the central bank followed the early trend with its daily fixing, putting the crown/dollar at 28.784, and the crown/mark at 17.040, or +3.03 against the basket. The pullout follows recent media reports that German banks see the crown moving lower and are advising clients to stay away from Czech bonds. The crown had strengthened since the beginning of the year by about three percent against the basket as demand from a wave of over 35 billion crowns worth of crown-denominated Eurobonds. ""The market has been very nervous and I think the German media reports were the last straw for some investors. They have decided to take their profits now and run,"" said a London-based trader. At the crown's peak earlier this month -- before talk of possible central bank intervention on the market -- it rose to +5.5 percent over parity. Many investors had boosted the crown as they looked to take advantage of a high interest rate differential with western Europe but the central bank comments, coupled with an easing of interbank market rates have taken away much of the crown's lustre. ""I think the market is on a calm wave...we expect further tests for the Czech crown weakening. We see also movement on the money market and money market derivatives,"" said Petr Korous of Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. Prague Interbank Offered Rates (PRIBOR) on Thursday traded in a range of 11.5-12.5 percent, down about 60-70 basis points from the beginning of the year. ING's Tichanek said there was little chance the currency would come close to returning to its highs earlier this month, adding the crown was having trouble finding strong support at current levels. Further damaging confidence in the crown is the country's burgeoning trade deficit. The Czech Statistical Bureau has forecast a 1997 shortfall of between 211-219 billion crowns after last year's record deficit of 160.3 billion crowns and analysts say that later in the year the crown will find itself under increasing depreciation pressure because of this. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ","AlanCrosby"
"Boeing Co. said Monday first-quarter profit more than doubled and sales rose 70 percent as it ramped up airplane production, but the results disappointed Wall Street and the company's stock tumbled. Boeing said it earned $313 million, or 87 cents a share, in the quarter, excluding an accounting credit, compared with $119 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue soared to $7.32 billion from $4.29 billion. But the net income was 13 percent below the Wall Street consensus of $1 a share, according to First Call, and Boeing stock lost $5.50 to $96.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ""The stock is down because earnings came in quite a bit below the consensus. That's it in a nutshell,"" said Peter Jacobs, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. Analysts said Boeing's earnings were hurt by higher-than-expected research and development expenses for new airplane models and other projects including a commercial space venture. The company also said it was incurring significant overtime costs as it increases production to meet rising demand and warned that profit margins would be under pressure for the rest of the year. ""It's sort of a wake-up call to some analysts who I think have been a little too optimistic about their margins,"" said Bob Toomey at Piper Jaffray. Boeing said profit margins would be lower for the rest of the year because of growing deliveries of the new 777 and next-generation 737 models. New models carry lower profit margins until the company has written down the costs of production equipment. ""The fundamentals remain as strong as ever -- they remain excellent,"" Toomey said. ""They'll work through this problem."" Boeing delivered 68 commercial aircraft in the quarter, up from 40 in the year-earlier period when production was still hampered by the effects of a 10-week strike. For this year, Boeing reiterated that it expects to deliver 340 jets and generate revenue of $33 billion, compared with 218 jets and revenues of $22.7 billion last year. That does not include the planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp., which Boeing executives say will be completed in August and which will add about $15 billion of annual revenue. Analysts expect Boeing production to continue rising in 1998 to about 450 jets as the world's biggest commercial planemaker works to meet surging industry demand. ""You expect that if you're ramping up rates there would be some costs incurred, and that's clearly what's happening,"" said Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities. But he said he was encouraged that Boeing still expects to meet its production target for the year. ""There always is a significant risk of running into some sort of shortfall, and all of a sudden you wind up with airplanes that ... are most of the way done and missing some critical parts,"" he said. That happened to Boeing in the late 1960s, when the company nearly went bankrupt, he said. This time around there is no such danger, as the company said it had $5.5 billion in cash at the end of the quarter, up slightly from three months early. Boeing's backlog rose to $89.2 billion from $87.7 billion three months earlier, chiefly because of new defence contracts. Boeing also recorded a $64 million accounting credit related to an employee-benefit trust fund. Boeing shares were also pressured by other factors. The London Times reported on Saturday that Boeing competitors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Airbus Industrie were discussing a possible merger. In addition, the European Union and U.S. officials have begun talks on European complaints about U.S. subsidies to aircraft makers, and Boeing fears the outcome will be linked to an EU decision on its planned takeover of McDonnell Douglas, traders said. ""The earnings are not quite up to par, and the other stories are not helping,"" one trader said. ","MartinWolk"
"The federal government is expected to release the Wallis Inquiry's report into Australia's financial system later this week and respond to some parts of the report. The five-person inquiry, set up in June last year and chaired by businessman Stan Wallis, canvassed various options for reform in its 415 page discussion paper released in late November.

These six pillars are Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, National Mutual Holdings Ltd and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) Society. * Whether the anti-monopolies body, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), and the Treasurer should both continue to have the power to reject or approve a bank merger. This system is known as ""dual assessment."" Wallis stated his preference for treating the financial sector in the same way as any other on competition policy, implying the ""Six Pillars"" policy and ""dual assessment"" policies were unnecessary.   FOREIGN INVESTMENT * Whether the current ban on foreign takeovers of the big four banks should be scrapped. OWNERSHIP OF BANKS * Whether to scrap the current 10 percent limit on equity ownership by a single individual or group in a bank. PRUDENTIAL REGULATION   * Whether to combine the functions of the four regulatory bodies currently operating into a single body that provides prudential regulation and consumer protection regulation for all financial institutions. This is the ""mega-regulator"" option. Currently the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) regulates banks, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) regulates life and pension groups, the Australian Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC) regulates building societies and credit unions and the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) regulates companies generally and markets in particular. * Whether to have a single national prudential regulator of deposit taking institutions (DTIs) including banks and credit unions, and a separate regulator for insurance companies and superannuation funds, or, * a single prudential regulator covering both DTIs, insurance companies and pension groups, but not consumer protection regulation, or, * to keep the current four-pronged system. DEPOSIT INSURANCE * Whether banks, other DTI's and the government should make more explicit to consumers that their deposits are in fact not government guaranteed, and, * Whether a U.S.-style compulsory deposit insurance scheme should be set up to cope with depositer claims in the event a bank collapses.

Canada's ""dream team"" -- a galaxy of National Hockey League stars including Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier and Eric Lindros -- fell to an upstart American squad in a gripping finale to the World Cup championship on Saturday. Team USA, led by superb goaltending, defeated the Canadian squad 5-2 to win the best-of-three series in Montreal. Canadians -- who consider hockey more of a religion than a sport -- mourned the country's worst loss in international play since 1981 when the Soviet Union handed Team Canada a crushing defeat in the Canada Cup -- the precursor to the World Cup. Saturday night's loss has also rekindled fears of a further Americanisation of Canada's sacred game. ""I feel terrible, just terrible. That's why I'm here,"" Circiaco Deluca said as he quaffed a pint of beer in Wayne Gretzky's bar in Toronto, surrounded by mementos of past Canadian hockey glory. Gretzky, known as the Great One, summed up the feelings of most of his countrymen after Saturday's game. ""This is a crushed locker room right now and probably a crushed country. It's devastating,"" Gretzky told reporters. The disastrous outcome dominated the front pages of Canadian newspapers on Sunday. ""DAMN YANKEES,"" screamed the Montreal Gazette newspaper. ""AMERICA'S GAME,"" cried the Toronto Star, Canada's largest newspaper. ""The U.S. roared into Canada like a mayhem-minded mob of Hell's Angels and left with a major chunk of our national heritage,"" wrote Star hockey columnist Damien Cox. The tabloid Toronto Sun featured a cartoon of the Statue of Liberty with a hockey stick in one hand and the World Cup trophy in another. Canada's defeat comes at a time when many fans are lamenting the steady Americanisation of their game. Computer-enhanced pucks, flashy uniforms with cartoon characters, and the NHL's expansion into non-traditional markets like Phoenix and Nashville have made hockey purists cringe. A Canadian-based team has not won the NHL's championship Stanley Cup since 1993 and appears likely to extend the losing streak for another year. Small market clubs in Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa are struggling to stay alive in the face of skyrocketing costs. Quebec City and Winnipeg have already seen their franchises flee south to wealthier markets. Frank Diponzio, a tourist from Rochester, New York, said hockey's future will depend on it growing in the bigger U.S. market. ""It's not as popular as baseball or football, but it's getting bigger. Beating Canada at home will help,"" he said in an interview. Some Canadian fans were bitter that Canadian-born Brett Hull, the son of hockey legend Bobby Hull, scored twice in Saturday's game -- for the United States. Hull, who has dual citizenship, played most of the game to chants of ""Brett Hull sucks"" from the partisan crowd in Montreal's Molson Centre. ""I think he should have played for Canada. It just shows a lack of respect for the country,"" said Trevor Murray, an 18-year-old student sporting a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater. But others said the younger, faster U.S. team deserved credit for a gritty performance. ""It's not a national catastrophe. They played a great game and we'll be back,"" said Jack Porter of Sudbury, Ontario. ","DarrenSchuettler"
"Western countries are geared up to quietly grant asylum in the coming months to around 40 Chinese dissidents and their families who are living in exile in Hong Kong, human rights sources said on Tuesday. The plan has been worked out by a number of countries which fear the dissidents may face persecution by Beijing's Communist rulers after China takes Hong Kong back from Britain on July 1, the sources said. The fears of the exiles have grown over the past year as China unveiled plans to roll back democracy and human rights legislation introduced in Hong Kong under British rule and vowed not to allow ""anti-constitutional"" activities there. Anxiety has been further stoked by China's renewed crackdown on dissenters, many of whom have been jailed over the past year. ""There is a general feeling of relief because they are going to be resettled. But they won't feel safe until they are on the plane,"" the source, a well-informed veteran human rights campaigner, told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Hundreds of Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists fled after army tanks thundered into Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989, crushing a student-led democracy movement. Scores of the fugitives -- the exact number has not been officially made public -- found sanctuary in Hong Kong. A source from a dissident support group said there were between 100 and 200. A source from a dissident support group, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, said word was circulating among activists that London had secretly promised dissidents they could settle in Britain if no other western country gave them sanctuary before the handover. He said some dissident families had already been discreetly resettled in Western countries last year. The territory has been a refuge since the late 19th century for Chinese dissenters and revolutionaries, who often exploited the shield provided by British colonial rule. These included the revolutionaries led by Sun Yat-sen, the founder of China's first republic, who plotted against China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing, and toppled it in 1911. Many of the present dissidents-in-exile fled to Hong Kong along an elaborately organised secret escape route nicknamed ""Operation Yellow Bird"", with the help of Hong Kong activists and companies. To Beijing they are ""wanted criminals"". Some were were whisked out in speed boats and others were smuggled into Hong Kong in ships or trucks, activists say. The Hong Kong government has always declined to comment on asylum seekers out of fear of jeopardising their safety by drawing Beijing's attention to their whereabouts or of stirring up a quarrel, Western diplomats said. The human rights source declined to name the countries involved in the 1997 rescue plan or when the dissident families would be leaving. ""We don't know when they will leave. We don't know where they will be going,"" he said. Western countries, wary about upsetting Beijing, have remained tightlipped in reaction to Hong Kong newspaper reports about a mass resettlement plan for the dissidents. A well-known Chinese dissident in Hong Kong, labour activist and Tiananmen veteran Han Dongfang, told Reuters that Hong Kong would be unsafe for many dissidents after the handover. ""I cannot say 100 percent China is going to arrest them. But it is a concern,"" Han said. But he planned to stay regardless. ""I have to stay here to see what is going to happen,"" he said. ""I may leave if things go wrong."" ","PeterHumphrey"
"Toronto's stock market soared to the eighth record close of 1997, rallying on the back of high-flying golds and lots of takeover news in Canada's oil patch. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index lept 60.40 points to end at 6225.78. It also set a new intra-day record of 6225.83 points. ""The market finally has made a major break to all-time high levels,"" said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels. Turnover was heavy at 122 million shares worth C$2 billion ($1.48 billion). New York matched Toronto's gains, jumping 60.81 points to end at 7022.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average passed the key 7000 level on optimism about the U.S. economy, low inflation and stable interest rates. Canada's largest equities market made a strong move upward after surging bullion prices in London boosted heavyweight gold stocks. Investors also focused on the continuing merger activity in the Western-based oil and gas sector. All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices spiralled upward except for real estate. Golds, oils, transportation and consumer products led gaining groups. Advancing issues raced ahead of decliners 607 to 410 while 269 traded unchanged. Hot stocks included Morrison Petroleums Ltd., which rose 0.40 to 9.90 before being halted in late trading. It had been the target of a C$652 million ($482 million) hostile takeover by Canadian 88 Energy Corp. but on Thursday announced a merger with Northstar Energy Corp. Northstar rose 0.35 to 14.15 before the halt while Canadian 88 shares slipped 0.15 to 4.95. A marriage between Newport Petroleum Corp. and Cimarron Petroleum Ltd. was also announced early on Thursday. Newport shares lost 0.65 to 9.15 while Cimarron soared 3.20 to 23.50.

Wascana shares gained 2.05 to hit 19.00 on nine million shares, which was above the offering price of C$18.50 a share. ","LydiaZajc"
"GKN Plc, the UK auto-components group hit by a U.S. court verdict which awarded $398 million in damages to franchisees on Thursday, could see shares knocked further if the group fails to reverse the judgement through appealing, said analysts. One analyst said that if the group failed to overturn the judgement or have the damages drastically cut, shares could fall by 6.6 percent from the last closing level of 1045 pence per share. Shares have already fallen three percent, or 35 1/2 pence, to 1009 1/2 so far this session.   Another analyst saw shares falling 50 pence if the appeal by GKN is lost, but he was less pessimistic in his assessment. He pointed out that ""Yes, it is a shock for the market, but it is not significant to the operations of the company. ""If they lose there would be a large cash outflow and that could hit the value as a result of higher gearing. But it's a one-off scenario."" GKN has stated that under the worst case scenario the damages could be raised to $554 million on the basis that some parts of the claim are covered by the North Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act which allows for trebling of all penalties. He said that even if the current damages were upheld and not raised, the impact on GKN's cash reservees would be serious. He pointed out that GKN had 240-250 million pounds of free cash reserves which are unrelated to customer advance payments, ""So if they had to pay the fine that would wipe out their cash balances and if they wanted to make an acquisition they would have to increase debt of make a rights issue,"" he said. He added that the group was already ""quite stretched, there is already an over-distribution on the dividend from a cash-flow perspective."" The analyst has the company down as a ""sell"".   --London newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ","EdnaFernandes"
"Australian financial services group Colonial Ltd made a strong debut on the Australian share market on Monday, its share price soaring on listing. In early trading, Colonial shares opened at A$3.31 (US$2.56), well above the A$3.10 paid by institutional investors in the company's public share offer, which closed last Friday. The opening price eclipsed the A$2.60 paid by members of the public in the A$690 million float, but those who took their stag profits and ran on Monday failed to dent the price. In late morning trade, Colonial shares were trading around the opening price, giving the company a market capitalisation of A$1.9 billion and putting it in the top 50 Australian companies. ""We are obviously delighted that we have come on with a premium. It's a strong market response,"" Colonial managing director Peter Smedley said after watching the opening share price flash up on the stock exchange boards in Melbourne. Colonial on Monday became only the second life office to list on the local exchange, after one of its bigger rivals, National Mutual Holdings Ltd, made its debut last October. Australia's biggest, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, will soon follow. It plans to shed its old mutual structure and list in Australia and New Zealand next year. Smedley said he did not feel the share offer had been priced too low. ""I think the end result is a reflection of the fact we have set the price well,"" he told reporters. ""There was very heavy over-subscription from the public and a very positive response from institutions."" Each share issued came with an underwritten option to buy more, enabling the company to raise another A$200 million between September this year and June 1998. Colonial also made a strong debut on Monday on the New Zealand exchange, wher it has a secondary listing. ""It's certainly been an outstanding success,"" said Melbourne-based broker Kevin Lourey, of Peake Lands Kirwan. Colonial is devoting some of the float proceeds to development of its life insurance business in Asia. The group is spending US$163 million to buy out its old Asian partner, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd, from their equal life insurance joint venture based in Hong Kong. Colonial has applied for a licence to sell life insurance in China and has operations across Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. Its traditional offshore markets are Britain, New Zealand and Fiji. Colonial will also use A$50 million of the float proceeds to complete the 1994 purchase of the State Bank of New South Wales, now renamed Colonial State Bank. Colonial has total assets of A$29.7 billion and has forecast a net profit before preference dividends of A$180 million for calendar 1997, a-50 percent rise on its 1996 earnings.

"Czech railway unions said on Monday they would begin a nationwide strike at midnight demanding a complete overhaul of the decrepit rail system, and adding to growing unrest among public sector workers. The planned 48-hour strike, seeking a long-term plan to revive the failing state railways, is expected to completely shut passenger and freight traffic on domestic and international lines throughout the Czech Republic. ""We certainly will strike from midnight,"" the executive secretary of the Association of Unions of Rail Workers (OSZ), Zdenek Jilek, told Reuters. In a statement, the OSZ said that if it did not get sufficient guarantees to repair what it says are massive problems in the quality and development of the state railways Ceske Drahy, it would prolong the strike. ""It will be repeated every 24 hours,"" the OSZ said. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus was quoted by the CTK news agency as saying on Monday that a new development plan for the railways had already been negotiated with union leaders, and the unions were simply impatient for a result. ""If they could not hold on until when we meet again, and they call a strike, then they are taking a great risk in front of 10 million people of this country,"" he was quoted as saying. The action comes on top of an alternating ""chain"" strike started last week by teachers and school workers who are forcing the closure each day of selected primary and secondary schools throughout the country. The school strikes, for pay increases and more state expenditure on teaching resources, are alternating each day among various districts. There have also been persistent threats of industrial action by doctors and health-care workers, especially at large state clinics and hospitals which have fallen into insolvency. The centre-right coalition government has resisted giving into public sector demands which might threaten its fiscally-hawkish reputation. The country posted its first state budget deficit in 1996, at just over one billion crowns ($36 million), after three straight years with a budget surplus. The rail union leaders said that their action carries no demands for pay increases, but is rather to clean up what it says are ""massive problems"" in the leadership of Ceske Drahy and the transport policy of the Czech government. They said that the condition of the rail system was ""critical"" and problems were deepening, and that the government had not fulfilled its own decisions to improve and consolidate the railways. The OSZ represents all Czech rail workers, which total more than 100,000 employees, excluding train drivers who have yet to say whether they will support the action. It is not expected that the railways would function even if the drivers do not strike. Losses of Ceske Drahy, one of the few companies not yet privatised by the post-Communist government, have been mounting. CTK quoted Ceske Drahy officials as saying the company expected losses of about seven billion crowns in 1997 after a six billion crown loss last year, and four billion in 1995. In June 1995, the rail unions were hours away from a strike over the planned privatisation of Ceske Drahy, when the government agreed not to execute its plan at the time to restructure the loss-making railways.

"North Carolina's attorney general on Friday questioned the legal utility of the industry documents Liggett Group has promised to hand over for use against fellow cigarette companies. Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group, on Thursday agreed as part of a settlement with 22 state governments suing it to deliver internal documents that may help the states press their cases against Philip Morris and others. ""It's hard to see how Liggett Group would give up evidence of criminal behaviour,"" Easley said.   Easley has not filed a suit like 22 of his peers seeking compensation for billions of dollars spent by state governments on treating sick smokers. He favors a legislative resolution. North Carolina is the biggest tobacco-producing state in the country and home to leading manufacturers. Its governor has allied with the tobacco industry in fighting federal limits on marketing cigarettes, especially to young people.   The contents of the documents has not been made public. And tobacco company lawyers have secured an order barring the delivery until at least March 31, when a North Carolina state judge will hear arguments on whether not the Liggett handover would violate lawyer-client privileges for other companies. Easley dismissed as ""aggressive"" remarks by attorneys general announcing the Liggett deal on Thursday that the internal documents would be crucial in proving allegations of a conspiracy among the tobacco companies. A Liggett promise to pay 25 percent of pre-tax profits for a quarter of a century was worthless, he said, because Liggett has not been profitable in many years. ""It would appear that the (plaintiff) attorneys only wanted to get some papers,"" Easley said. Easley backed a bill in the North Carolina legislature that would regulate cigarette marketing to children. The courtroom battles against the tobacco industry would be resolved only by a sweeping new law from Washington, Easley said. ","MichaelConnor"
"Apple Computer Inc. said Friday it will cut 4,100 jobs, or nearly a third of its work force, and discontinue its consumer computer line in a bid to slash costs and return to profits. The restructuring, the second in a year, will cost Apple a total of $250 million in charges to earnings for the next three quarters, the company said. Meanwhile, Apple expects revenue for its fiscal second quarter, ending March, to plunge 22 percent to about $1.6 billion because of weak Macintosh sales. Apple said it plans to drop its Macintosh Performa PCs, the models geared toward home users, to concentrate on its more profitable Power Macintosh line. ""It's very painful to have to lay off people who have worked so hard during the past year in trying to bring Apple back to health,"" Chairman Gilbert Amelio said. But Apple needs to cut $500 million in annual costs just to break even this year, he said. Apple was bold to cut so many jobs and to discontinue one of its key brands, analysts said. But the company still does not have a clear plan to get sales going again. ""The company is on the aggressive side on reducing costs,"" said Walter Winnitzki, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York. ""But the issue for me is, can Apple reignite its sales momentum?"" Hampering Apple's efforts to reignite sales, the company also said it will not ship a long-awaited revamped operating system  -- the software that controls the basic functions of its PCs -- until at least June 1998, about six months later than the company had previously said. Investors and Apple customers have been counting on the new operating system, code-named ""Rhapsody,"" to give Apple's computers a clear technological lead over PCs using technology from Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. The uncertainty surrounding the Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker will keep customers away from the Mac isle at computer stores, analysts said. The job cuts include 2,700 full-time employees and 1,400 contract workers. Apple plans to give employees 60-day notices later this month. Before the layoffs, Apple employed about 13,400 including contract workers. In the fiscal second quarter ending March 31, Apple will take a $155 million charge against earnings to cover the cost of the layoffs. The company also plans to take another $322.5 million charge for the December acquisition of Next Software Inc. Fred Anderson, Apple's finance chief, declined to say what the company's total loss in the second quarter will be, but analysts said their preliminary estimates are close to $1 billion. With the cost cuts, Apple could return to profit by the fiscal fourth quarter ending September, Anderson said. Apple, which invented the first user-friendly computer, has suffered in recent years from missed opportunities, management turmoil and failed products. Amelio, who took over in early 1996, has been refocusing Apple's effort on its healthiest businesses. As part of the restructuring, Apple will drop development of software based on the so-called OpenDoc technology and computer servers based on International Business Machines Corp.'s AIX standard. Apple also will stop development of its video-conferencing products. The company will keep its Newton handheld computer for now, Apple said. The Newton was expected to be discontinued or sold to another company as part of Friday's restructuring. Amelio has been under increasing pressure from shareholders and loyal customers to come up with new products to get sales going again. On Friday, he dismissed calls for him to step down. ""Why would I step aside when we are at the cusp of turning this around?"" he told reporters. ","KouroshKarimkhany"
"Seven Network Ltd chairman Kerry Stokes attacked Prime Minister John Howard on Friday, accusing him of having done a ""disgraceful"" deal to deliver newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd to billionaire Kerry Packer. Stokes told Reuters in an interview Howard had no right to negotiate any deal on Seven's ownership as part of a larger plan to ensure a Packer takeover of Fairfax. ""Who the hell does the Prime Minister think he's representing?"", Stokes said.   ""For the Prime Minister to play king-maker revisits the darkest days of the Labor Party's deal-making with its mates,"" he said. Earlier on Friday the Australian Financial Review newspaper reported Howard had offered to do a deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd whereby News would be allowed to raise its stake in the Seven Network if News supported an easing of cross-media rules to allow a Packer takeover of Fairfax. The Financial Review said Howard's plan fell through last week when News rejected one part of it which would have seen News sell some of its Australian newspapers to a new owner.   Stokes said the reported deal showed Howard had done a deal with Packer. ""He has made a commitment ... done a deal with Packer. There's no other reason for the change,"" Stokes said. ""It's obviously to deliver Fairfax to Packer,"" he said. ""It shows a disgraceful disregard for the public interest."" Stokes said such a deal meant the public would be robbed of an opportunity to have a say on media policy in Australia. Stokes' Australian Capital Equities currently owns 26 percent of Seven while News owns about 14 percent.   News, which is classified as a foreign shareholder because of Murdoch's U.S. citizenship, cannot own more than 15 percent of Seven under current foreign ownership rules. Howard would have to grant an exemption. The conservative Liberal-National government is currently reviewing the cross-media rules set up by the former Labor government prevent television station owners from owning a major newspaper in the same city or vice versa. These rules stop Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd increasing its 12 percent Fairfax stake beyond 15 percent while it owns the top-rating Nine television network.   The government is widely expected to drop the cross-media rules, allowing Packer to launch a takeover bid for Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian Financial Review and The Age newspapers. Some commentators have said the government's decision to drop the cross-media rules had come after Packer endorsed Howard in a television interview before the 1996 election campaign. The Financial Review report earlier on Friday said Howard had attempted to arrange the deal so as to mute mounting criticism about a lack of media diversity should Packer take over Fairfax.   Packer was forced to withdraw from a consortium bidding for Fairfax in the the early 1990s after a public outcry led by former Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser. Prime Minister Howard was not available to respond to Stokes specific comments, but his office said earlier comments made by Howard rejecting accusations of such a deal still stood. Howard said late on Thursday he had opposed the cross-media rules for a long time and his views had nothing to do with Packer's support for him in the election campaign. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","BernardHickey"
"Opposition leader Milos Zeman asked Czech parliament on Wednesday to approve a separate resolution which would ""clarify"" his concerns about a post-World War Two reconciliation pact with Germany. But deputies in Zeman's own Social Democratic party (CSSD) admitted that the votes were probably were still there, without the extra resolution, to push the deal with Germany through parliament, and save the Czech government from embarrassment. As debate dragged into a second day on the declaration -- already signed by the Prague and Bonn governments and approved by the German parliament -- Zeman demanded the accompanying rider, which the governing coalition has already rejected. ""I would want to believe this parliament would find the courage to express itself on the declaration in its resolution, as the parliament of a sovereign state,"" said Zeman, who chairs the lower house and the CSSD. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's three-party conservative coalition, which is two seats short of a majority in the lower house, has rejected any sort of extra resolution which may ""interpret"" the already-signed declaration. In the accord, Bonn expresses regret for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague its sorrow for brutality in post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans. The text also includes German support for Czech membership of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). It also skirts around the most sensitive issues of direct compensation for property seized from the expelled Germans. German politicians sympathetic to families of expellees, now mostly residing in southern Germany, have said that the issue of individual compensation for property was still open, despite the inter-governmental declaration. Zeman said the comments made by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, after he signed the document, and later by Finance Minister Theo Waigel, showed that Bonn considered the ""property problems"" still unresolved. ""These subsequent statements are the basic reason for my concern,"" Zeman told Czech parliament. CSSD vice-chairman Karel Machovec said that while the add-on resolution, which has yet to be presented, might help ensure a larger majority for the declaration, he acknowledged the government probably had the votes to win. ""I know about three or four Social Democrats who would vote for the declaration,"" Machovec told Reuters, saying he would be among members voting in favour of the deal with Germany. But debate in the Czech lower house looked set to continue late into the week, with small opposition parties attempting filibusters and other procedural moves to block the declaration from coming to a vote. The ultra-right Republican Party and the Communist Party claim that the declaration lets Germany off lightly for Nazi attrocities and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. ","JanLopatka"
"Papua New Guinea's Australian-listed stocks rallied in active trade on Thursday as foreign investors breathed a sigh of relief at the peaceful resolution of the Pacific nation's 10-day political crisis. Analysts and brokers said investors welcomed Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan's decision late on Wednesday to step aside, which appeared to have calmed an explosive situation and would allow a peaceful transition to a new government.   ""Everyone is relieved that the parliamentary process actually worked and that we didn't go into a period of military control,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett Head of Mining Research David Walker. ""The expectation that the mid-year elections can be brought forward and that there can be an orderly resolution of the impasse has been accepted well,"" Walker said. Chan stood down on Wednesday under widespread pressure to quit for his hiring of mercenaries to crush an uprising on copper-rich Bougainville island.   Mining investments group Orogen Minerals Ltd, which is owned 51 percent by the PNG government, closed up eight cents at A$3.10. Oil producer and explorer Oil Search Ltd, which is the largest of the pure Papua New Guinea stocks listed in Australia, closed up 13 cents at A$2.70. The developer of the one of the world's largest gold deposits at Lihir in PNG, Lihir Gold Ltd, rose two cents to A$2.15. Papua New Guinea retailer and trader, Collins and Leahy Ltd closed up 25 cents at A$3.50 while Bougainville Copper Ltd closed up five cents at 60 cents.   Papua New Guinea does not have its own stock market, with most large public companies listing on Australia's exchange. However, analysts said PNG stocks were unlikely to recover all their losses of the past ten days because investors remained somewhat wary of the resource-rich South Pacific nation while the makeup and policies of its new government were undecided. ""It's positive that Chan's (stepped aside) and it should calm the situation up there somewhat,"" said ANZ Securities gold analyst David Kauler.   ""However, it's clear PNG is now in election mode and there's still a period of three to six months of uncertainty ahead ... but it is a cheap time to be buying some of those PNG stocks, particularly Lihir on the gold side,"" Kauler said. Investor confidence remained bruised by images of street riots and the tense standoff between the army and government. ""It's going to be a difficult, volatile period for investment in the country,"" Kauler said. ""You're going to see a fight between people who see a cheap buying opportunity and other people saying we don't know what the policy is going to be for six months, so let's steer clear.""   Analysts also said the resolution of the political crisis could bring higher taxes for foreign miners, although any new government was unlikely to restrict entry to resource groups. ABN AMRO's Walker said the new government would have to look at raising taxes, possibly even the 1.25 percent mining royalty to solve its chronic budget deficits problem. However, the return to stability in Papua New Guinea at the same time as the controversy over the supposedly huge Busang gold deposit in nearby Indonesia had also created a window of opportunity for extra resource investment, analysts said.   ""PNG, having overcome its immediate problems, has really got to settle down and project an image of stability, because there will be capital funds coming out of Indonesia potentially available for PNG projects,"" Walker said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","BernardHickey"
"British electronics retailer Dixons Group Plc on Wednesday said strong personal computer sales helped profits jump 53 percent and sales rise eight percent in the first half. But profit taking and concern over the impact of planned tax increases affecting extended warranties took the shine off its shares, which fell 27 pence to close at 511 pence. ""Bearing in mind the sort of out-performance we have seen lately (in the shares), the shares are running into some profit-taking,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named. The group said pretax profits in the six months to November 9, 1996, soared to 57.5 million pounds ($97.4 million), at the top end of expectations, from 37.5 million pounds previously, and paid out a dividend of 2.4 pence, up from 2.05 pence. On the turnover front, Dixons said sales from existing stores were up eight percent in the first half, a figure maintained in the first eight weeks of the second half which covers the key Christmas period. ""Christmas trading was highly satisfactory,"" chairman Sir Stanley Kalms said in a statement. Managing director John Clare told Reuters that consumer spending was growing but there was no boom, adding that if the economy was managed well, ""we can't see any reason why it should not continue."" PCs and accessories including software accounted for around 26 percent of the group's total sales in the first half, inching towards 30 percent over the Christmas period, he added. ""I expect personal computer sales to grow...household penetration is still very low in the UK,"" Clare added. Dixons said its PC World division, which specialises in PC sales in out-of-town superstores, saw total sales rocket 96 percent higher in the first half, or 21 percent stripping out the effect of new selling space. Dixons opens around ten PC World superstores each year and Clare said that expansion rate was expected to continue. Gross margins in the early weeks of the second half were ""at similar levels year on year,"" Kalms said in the statement, after increasing ""slightly"" in the first half. Dixons said that it could not predict the full effect of the government's plans to raise insurance premium tax to 17.5 percent from a previous 2.5 percent on its extended warranty business. ""There is a bit of worry over what the impact might be,"" one share trader said. Kalms, however, told Reuters Financial Television, ""I don't expect it (the tax change) to be of much consequence to our overall profitability."" Clare said future margins were also hard to predict, with a ""swings and roundabouts"" pull between lower margins on PC hardware and the benefits of reduced credit promotion competition. ""There are two contrary forces at work...PCs are taking a higher share of the product mix...(but) there are benefits from reduced competitive activity, particularly in credit promotions,"" he said. Retail outlets of regional electricity companies have been trimmed, for example, as a result of takeovers and consolidation in the sector. Clare said digital technology was likely to provide another growth market for the company with wide-screen digital television likely to debut in 1998. ""Digital technology is generally coming in in a big way...(but) I don't think it will replace PCs, because PCs will continue to grow,"" he said. Capital investment during the current financial year is expected to be over 100 million pounds and at similar levels for the year after. ($1=.5904 Pound) ","JoWinterbottom"
"Chinese authorities have closed down 12 illegal compact disc production lines in just two weeks, but Beijing still has far to go to conquer the nation's army of copyright pirates, officials and analysts said on Thursday. Tough action to curb theft of intellectual property rights had netted more than 10 million counterfeit products in 1996 and had won recognition even in Washington, which in June took China to the brink of trade war over the issue, officials said. Officials in booming southern Guangdong province had shut down 12 music and video disc production lines since December 10 as part of a national crackdown on pornography and piracy, said Wang Ziqiang of the National Copyright Administration of China. ""We have uncovered quite a few pirate production lines... Guangdong province has taken very effective steps,"" Wang told Reuters in an interview. The crackdown on pirates and pornographers had had clear successes, the Overseas Edition of the People's Daily quoted Minister of Culture Liu Zhongde as saying. ""This year...we have seized more than 10 million illegal audio-visual products and dealt with 6,912 illegal work units,"" Liu said, adding that Beijing had also strengthened the market in legitimate audio-visual products. U.S. officials said this week that there were indications that China was doing a better job of enforcing the Sino-U.S. copyright accord that averted a trade war in June, with plant closures and tougher controls on imports of illegal equipment. Washington has long accused Beijing of doing too little to curb the lucrative pirating of U.S. intellectual property rights. Beijing says it has moved faster than any other developing nation to clamp down on the underground industry. While China was moving in the right direction on intellectual property, the efforts of the last year appeared to have had little lasting effect on the roaring retail market in pirated goods, said one Western industry consultant. Blockbuster Hollywood movies were readily available on pirated video discs for as little 20-30 yuan ($2.40-3.60) per film despite the high-profile national crackdown, said the consultant, who declined to be named. ""There are lots of places to buy discs,"" he said. ""They are periodically raided, but afterwards the show goes on. Pirate producers often had connections with local officials, making anything more than a cosmetic crackdown a potential battle of political wills between the central government and increasingly autonomous local authorities, he said. Copyright official Wang said piracy was a problem found in most countries and was not something that could be eliminated by just a few years of tough action. ""The key point is the government's attitude to the problem,"" Wang said, adding that U.S. attitudes to China's copyright problems were far from even-handed. ""The (copyright) situation in some other countries is worse than here, but I don't think the United States is as strict with them,"" he said. Officials have said Beijing plans to launch video rental counters in post offices as a way of curbing private rental shops that often offer cut-price pirate videos for hire.

"Australia's second largest telecom carrier Optus Communications Pty Ltd said on Wednesday it expects a strong result for the June 30 year and still aimed for a sharemarket float in 1997, despite litigation delays. Optus also formally reported a net profit of A$58.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 1996, up from A$7.1 million a year earlier. The result was first announced last week by its 25 percent shareholder Mayne Nickless Ltd. ""We are expecting a very strong result for the full year,"" Optus chief executive officer Ziggy Switkowski told reporters.   Optus reported a profit of A$60.3 million for the 1995/96 year, which compared with a loss of A$17.0 million in 1994/95. Sales rose 31.2 percent to A$1.19 billion, buoyed by a strong lift in revenue from its mobile business. Chief operating officer Phil Jacobs told Reuters he expected sales to continue the strong trend in the 1996/97 second half. ""It will be somewhere by a similar amount,"" Jacobs said. Switkowski said Optus still planned a sharemarket float in calendar 1997, but a float would have to await the outcome of the litigation between its 46.5 percent owned associate Optus Vision and television station Seven Network Ltd.   Asked at a media briefing if Optus Communications would put off its float past this year, Switkowski said: ""No, not at all the float is clearly held up by the process of the litigation, once the litigation is resolved, the board will meet and make decisions about how the float should proceed going forward."" ""The timetable for this year is still very much our desire,"" Switkowski said. However, Switkowski said there was a possibility that Optus' planned float may clash with the timing of the sale of one third of government owned Telstra Corp, which would be a far bigger capital raising than Optus.   ""It does appear that the Telstra float will be at the latter part of the year, so when our schedule is clarified and indeed when the Telstra schedule is clarified, we will have a look at what that means to us,"" Switkowski said. ""It is not impossible that those floats will happen about the same time, we will see later this year,"" he said. Switkowski would not comment on the litigation between Optus Vision and Seven or Vision's local telephony services launched mid-1996 to break Telstra A$5 billion market monopoly. But Optus' Jacobs said Optus Communications had other strategies besides using Optus Vision for the local call market.   Optus Communications has pumped about A$605 million into Optus Vision, which is currently rolling out its cable network to 2.5 million homes or 40 percent of Australian households. ""It has never been Optus Vision's intention to cable up to 100 percent of Australia's population,"" Jacobs told reporters. ""It has been our intention as Optus Communications to offer our services to a wide a customer base as possible and we have from the very beginning looked at a multiple strategy to get to those customers,"" Jacobs said. If Optus Vision loses its legal battle with Seven, Optus forced to sell its Vision stake at a discount to Seven.   Jacobs said the full deregulation of Australia's telecom market on July 1, 1997 would put pressure on margins across all of its businesses, but this would be more than offset by growth in the overall telecommunications market. ""There is no doubt that there will be erosion in some areas of our business as competition comes in...but we fully expect that erosion of share would be more than offset by the continued growth of the business,"" Jacobs said. Optus is also owned 24.5 percent each by Cable and Wireless Plc of Britain and U.S. telephone carrier BellSouth Corp Inc. The remainder is owned by Australian institutions.   -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 ","KevinMorrison"
